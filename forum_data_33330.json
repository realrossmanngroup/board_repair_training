Cannot find any trace of corrosion anywhere.\n\nHas a green and then orange light on the magsafeboard, but doesnt power on (i know that the fan spins only at higher cpu-temps)\nHave tested with knowngood battery.\n\nPP5V_S5 = 4.97V\n\nmeasured P5VS4_EN on pin 2 of U8060, but get 0V\n\nI don't fully understand how PP3V3_S4 is created.\n\nany pointers?"
