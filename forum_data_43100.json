The screen showed \"battery charging symbol\" which concludes pictures is there after all, the screen is good.\n\nInspected motherboard for visual signs, found water damage around Q7630, C7260, C7622, C7624, L1295, C7630, R7631. Basically around that area.\n\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING measures 0.115 diode mode. (or correctly saying Threshold Voltage, I guess.) Isn't that too low for that rail?\n\nI suspect computer never really turns on fully, so no brain issue?"
