        "message":"the board power up fine, passed apple dialogistic and can goto macOS but when goes to full CPU load after a few seconds, the board will turn off without warning.\nthe board had liquid damage around C7430. but Q7410 and Q7630 were really clean. the back of the board was very clean as well.\ni went ahead replaced Q7410 and Q7630 anyway in case these were affected. U5800, U5620 and U7200 look clean under the microscope.\n\nany suggestion? replace all components that use PPBUS_S5_Computing or could be something else unless this board is trash :( ?\n\n[MEDIA=youtube]gd4MAQ-Wi5s[\/MEDIA]"
