        "message":"Just thought I would share this info for the board.\n\nI worked on a apple M1 Air today that came in for a cracked screen.  \nUnit would not switch to 20v.\n\nPulled the heat sink and looked under thermal and discovered the PMIC for the CPU U7700 was getting hot on the bottom center section.\nIdentified the buck converter that was heating up and the rail that went into the CPU.  PP0V88_S1  Isolated the rail and injected.   The CPU was bad.\n\nThis is my first CPU short with the M1.  I guess it was caused by a short in the screen when the unit was dropped.   \n\n\nThought I would share this info incase someone else encountered this problem and was looking for answers.\n\nCheers."
