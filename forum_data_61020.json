I replaced the CD3215, and the mac started working again, with no other problem.\n\nThen, after a few days, the client reported that the mac stoped charging the battery, and now it doesn't power on at all. The metter only shows 5V, on all ports, and the ampmeter doesn't reboot on any port (steady 5V on all ports).\n\nCan you help?"
