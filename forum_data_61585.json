        "message":"I have a MacBook Air with water damage. There was some corrosion on the logicboard. I cleaned the board with ultrasonic and it's turning on and working when the charger is connected. I test it with a new battery as well but as soon as I disconnect the charger it turns off. when it turns on the lid it shows the battery has 96%  charge. \nany advice which area should I look for?"
