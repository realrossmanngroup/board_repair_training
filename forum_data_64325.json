        "message":"Hi\n\ngot an Macbook Air A1466 820-00165-A. Initially found liquid damage on U3210 and near C3286. replaced it and cleaned. \nbut there was still no life. i can notice a pulse when switch on the power supply. current goes to normal 350-400mAmp just for 0.5 second then goes to zero and again one more pulse after 1 -2 sec and jump upto 200mAmp. after that no activity.\n\nI removed U8080 and notice presence of PP5V_S4RS3 which is stable at 5V. tried replacing U8080 but no change. found P5VS0_EN absent and PM_SLP_S3_L also absent.\n\ni removed U8080 and got  P5VS0_EN , PP5V_S4RS3 and PM_SLP_S3_L  present.  tried to trace down PP5V_S0 to find the problem but could not find any.\nplease suggest what could be the possible solution.\n\nthank you"
