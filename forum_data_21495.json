        "message":"Got a 2011 15\" in which boots fine with its original ssd but once I use a external drive or put a different drive in the machine it just sits at the loading bar.\n\nIt was put on the roof of a car and he just drove off. No liquid damage. I put it in our airing cupboard for an hour and it boots to a external drive now. Does this point towards the gpu? If so is there a way of \"disabling\" the gpu? since the customer donated the machine I was thinking of giving it to my mum for browsing the internet so nothing graphics intensive."
