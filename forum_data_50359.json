The trackpad doesn't work beyond that - no movement. No response from keyboard. Not sure where to go with this. Everything is measuring fine that I can think to check."

That was keeping the trackpad from getting power initially which seemed to keep it off after that. I switched out U8010 and 3V3_S3 comes up to 3.3V immediately now. All is good. Thanks."
