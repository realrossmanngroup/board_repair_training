        "message":"I have this liquid damaged machine. Initially the fan spun very fast and was making the 3 beeps Ram sound. I took the machine apart and noticed the underside of the fan was sticky and had liquid damage.\nAfter the board was ultrasonic'd the machine boots fine now but the fan issue remained. In ASD the fan was the only thing to fail. \nI even tried plugging in a fan from a 13\" Air but that still did the same thing. \n\nI put the board under a microscope and noticed that Q6060 was missing from the board so i put another one on it but still the fans spin on high immediately after the charger is plugged in.\nHere are some voltages I get from that area.\nR6061 Pin 1 - 3.32v Pin 2 - quickly pulses around 0.85v but then stays at 0.05v\nR6065 Pin 1&2 - 1.62v\nR6060 Pin 1 - 3.32v Pin 2 - 1.61v\n\nJ6000\nPin 1 - 5.1v\nPin 2 - 1.62v\nPin 3 - 4.63v"
