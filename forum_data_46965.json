        "message":"More dificil to diagnose after you changed many things.\nYou must always measure something, before change components.\n\nDid you solder exactly same code (C00) for all USB-C controllers?\nAre you sure all have been perfectly soldered?\nIf only one doesn't work correctly, SMC will not allow charger function.\n\nIf machine starts when battery has some charge, means there is no problem on PPBUS_G3H, nor 3V42 powe rails.\nAnd of course all secondary power supplies work.\nYou can have temperature sensor problem, or maybe trackpad not connected in that test.\n\nYou main problem is before ISL6259 I suppose.\nOr it gets blocked from some reason.\nCheck all LDO outputs from CD3215 chips; voltage and resistance to ground (diode mode).\nAlso check CHGR_A\/BMON, SMC_BC_ACOK and SMC_RESET_L (with charger only)."
