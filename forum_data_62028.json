Out of curiosity, I tested with the customers original screen and the issue is still present.\nHas anyone experienced this before or know what I'm up against here?\nThe display cable looks fine and I cannot see any physical damage to the body of the unit.\n\nI do not have FlexBV and the only schematics I can find for this one is a BVR file that can't be opened with openboardview so I am a little in the dark here."
