        "message":"Im getting a short every time I plug in the screen, my first suspect was Q7707, however I have already replaced it and everything measures correctly.  EDP_BKLT_EN is 3.2V, same with BKLT_PLT_RST, its at 3.2V as well.\n\nWhen I plug in the screen LCDBKLT_EN_L gets 0V, and Q7706 gets shorted somehow. PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLTFET goes to 1V, on F7700, and on Q7706 (Pin 4) and R7788, R7789, and C7782.\n\nBy the way PPBUS_G3H is at 8.6V, but goes to 1V on PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLTFET\n\nWhen the screen is unplugged I get 8.6V on F7700, and 8.6V on PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLTFET. Q7706 does not open of course but then there is 8V on LCDBKLT_EN_L.\n\nResistance of R7788 and R7789 are correct\n\nI have already replaced C7782, Q7706 (Twice) and Q7707."

It was trolling me, I normally measure if fuses are good or bad with resistance, however when i checked continuity through it, no beep, so thank you!\n\nHowever another thing is wrong, I get backlight however on only half of the screen, tested on 2 good screens and both have the same issue. R7720 - R7722 both measure 0V when should be 14V correct? This has to be U7701 correct?"
