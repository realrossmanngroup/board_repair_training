        "message":"Hi Team,\n\nLast week I've fixed a 00045 board after reflowing the CPU (common failure), the machine turns ON and boots fine only if I unplug the trackpad on the end of the flex ribbon.......flex ribbon which is new.\nI'm waiting for a new trackpad to arrive to test.\nI think ( not sure at 100% ) that after fixing it, I've turned the flex ribbon upside down, and maybe that would be the reason.\nIf I turn ON the machine, then plug the trackpad, it suddenly turns OFF, like I have a short to gnd.\n\nAlso I've noticed that PPBUS_G3H_TPAD_FLT is mesuring in diode mode,  0.0002V (short to gnd ) with the trackpad connected VS 0.457V without trackpad\nI think that if the issue would come from the motherboard it wouldn't even turns ON.......that's why I think the tracpad is faulty\nWhat do you think?"
