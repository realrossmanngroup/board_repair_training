        "message":"I'm working on a water damaged 820-3476-A. I did a lot of work, cleaning the board and changing this parts:\nC5120, C7095, C7102, R7095, R7096, C3740, C2951, R7080, C5131, C1950, Q7520, Q5490, R5491, R5492, Q5480, R5481, R5482, U5110.\n\nI did a reflow for U5000.\n\nThe naked board starts with 36mA for half a second, falls down to 9mA and goes up to 16mA after a second. Green light flashes for 2 Seconds and then orange light stable.\nAfter soldering Q5490 und Q5480 the board was a bit warm and it took for one start something between 200-300 mA and the ventilator was running. This was only one time.\n\nHere are my measurements:\nPPBUS_G3H = 8,6v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING = 8,6v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER5V = 8,6v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER3V3 = 8,6v\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL = 19,0v\nPPDCIN_G3H = 19,0v\nPP3V42_G3H = 3,42v\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3,3v\nPP5V_S5 = 5,0v\n   PP5V_S4 = 0,0V\n   PP5V_S0 = 0,0v\nPP3V3_S5 = 3,3v\n   PP3V3_S4 = 0,0v\n   PP3V3_SUS = 0,0v\n   PP3V3_S3 = 0,02v\n   PP3V3_S0 = 0,1v\n\nP5VS4_DRVH = 0,0v\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0v\n\nMy troubleshooting has now stalled. It would be great if you could help me further."
