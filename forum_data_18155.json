        "message":"Have a board here with a bit of history, outsourced the board to repair for china a couple years ago before I did rework. Sold to a friend, worked for a year, then failed. Was sent back to china again, came back working. Sat in cupboard for a couple weeks and now it doesn't boot.\n\nSpent some time with it. Seems PM_SLP_S5_L is missing, and the rails that rely on that are missing. All s5 rails present. PP3V3_SUS present. PM_DSW_PWRGD present.\n\nHas a look over to see if I can tell what china rework messed with and looks like L7310 and l7320 were pulled off at some point.\n\nIm pretty new to rework, so if someone could point me in the right direction that would be appreciated."
