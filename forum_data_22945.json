        "message":"Hello all, Today I Have a 820-3330 that is giving image, but no backlight\nClient said they spilled tea on their computer (assuming kb) No liquid damage on board.\n\nLVDS connector is good, fuse is good, not sure about cable as I don't have a spare one to try. But SW_0 is 21v, so that wouldn't be enough to give me back light anyways...\n\nQ9706\npin 4 - 12.56\npin 3 - 12.19\npin 1,2,5,6 0.04 and drops (without screen connected)\n\nQ9707\npin 5 - 3.3v w\/screen conn\npin 4 - 0v\n\nR0901 = 4.63k\n\nU9600\nPP1V2_S0 - 1.2V\nPP1V8_S0 - 1.8v\nPP3V3_S0_GMUX_R - 3.3V\n\nU9701\nBKL_EN - 3.12V\nSW_0 - 21v\n\n\nCapslock button turns green for a moment, then back off\n\nAnyone know what pins on J5713 I can short to act like the brightness up button before replacing kb? Unfortunately I do not have one in stock at the moment.\n\nThanks!"

Worked like a charm, I have light now :) can the USB kb also be used for an SMC reset? I tried, but it didn't work for me."
