        "message":"Not that interested in weather or not this actually gets fixed.\nBut i have a 2915 here that i fitted a GPU to (6750M)\n\nThe original symtom was no display internal and hangs on boots (external) \n\nIve got it all running on external, but the internal doesnt get recognised. LVDS looks clean, checked with a known good assembley, LCD_PWR_EN is not present, But 3v3_S0 does get to the screen.\nIm only getting a bit wound up by this as its running stress tests perfectly and responding completely normally other than the lack of display on internal.\nIs there anything to check?\nIts worth noting that u9500 had been replaced prior to me getting the machine. Im hoping its not the gmux or a PCB issue"
