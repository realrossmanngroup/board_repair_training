        "message":"Good day gentlemen,\n\nToday I have a 00165 board with no backlight. I didn't spot any signs of water damage (just a tiny spot of green kaka on C3232 and C3233 but that seems to be Thunderbolt related and I replaced them anyway) and I tested it with a new screen.\nFollowing a sticky troubleshoot guide I have measured 8.5 Volts of on output voltage and 2.7V on EN pin of led driver. I have replaced the led driver but that did not solve the problem. \nI am not sure how to proceed. PLease advice.\n\nThanks you."
