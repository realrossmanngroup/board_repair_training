Get a used assembly with some scratches, not the ones with a new LCD installed.\n\nMaybe you can spend some time figuring out how to flash the EDID over the eDP AUX channel. I was looking at the PTN3460 eDP to LVDS converter, but have no idea if the DDC data lines will work both ways.  Go get a PTN3460 and \"dead bug\" it to a LCD connector and see if you can flash the EDID."
