        "message":"Hi every one,\nhaving a A1297 820-2914 board this time. problem is that it can't boot up into the MAC OS\/installation usb drive for MAC OS.\n\nseen too many of this before on 820-2915 a1286 boards, it's caused by GPU for that model and fixed too many of them.\nso first thing I did was to replace the GPU with a brand new one.I'm sure the process went all good as we did too many for 820-2915 already.\n\nbut after cool down, put everything back and tested it,still same issue. did a P+R+COMMAND+OPTION reset,didn't seem to help.\nI'm just thinking what can be the cause.. of course SSD and cable were all tested and we tested with usb and still can't boot all the way.\n\nit will stuck in the middle of the process and doesn't move at all?\n\nany thoughts would be appreciated.
