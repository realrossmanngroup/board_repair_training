        "message":"Clean 00239, no liquid, with no power. Board has ppbus (13.2v) and 20v on USB-C power input (0W\/0A draw), but not much else. SMC_PM_G2_EN is missing completely. Thought it might be the SMC since signal was missing completely, but replaced SMC and symptoms persist. Also replaced U7650 to be safe. SMC power (3v3_g3h_SMC_vdd) is present. I have .4v at L7960, and no damage or anything around U7800. All related pull-up resistors for SMC_PM_G2_EN (R5192, R8110) measuring fine. SMC_RESET signals all high.\n\nIs this possibly a U7800 power issue? Nothing gets warm, no shorts on S5_HS, etc. Everything stops at SMC_PM_G2_EN. All help appreciated!"
