        "message":"Good day guys, have got  an 820-00923 with a faulty Touch Bar strip , so I replaced it with a new one , and it works great, but the client brought  it back that the Touch ID stopped  working. I try to reconnect the cable just to be sure . but no changes, the option is not even present in system preferences, so I decide to completely reinstall macOS, but still no changes. please help guys, I neither know what I did wrong that could have caused it or what to do to resolve it , since I can not even replace the cable because of it being tied to the board"

If I don't resolve this , the owner might ask for another machine, even though I done know how the resistor was knocked. please advice"
