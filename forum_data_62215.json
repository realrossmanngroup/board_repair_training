        "message":"This MB had a liquid damage at the audio-board and did get a new Audio board and flex cable.\nBut there is no output at the internal speakers. Output headphone is ok.\n\nSPKRAMP_RESET_L = low, diodemode is 0,512\nSPKRAMP_RESET_L = low, diodemode is 0,002\n\nI removed U6400, C6103 and the flexcabel to the audioboard. J6100 and all traces looks good.\nSo i think the short of SPKRAMP_RESET_L is probably inside T2, what do yout think?\n\nCould it be a solution, setting SPKRAMP_RESET_L high with an jumperwire?"
