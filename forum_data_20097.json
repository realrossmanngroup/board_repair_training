        "message":"I have a wine damaged 820-3332 board no major signs of corrosion, when plugged in we get green to orange light when mag safe 2 is plugged in, however would not power on or get a fan spin, measures PBBUS G3H was low voltage between 4.6v and tested found an issue in the isl6259 chip, I ordered a few new chips, when they came in I soldered the new one on and still no post or fan spin, after replacing the island the voltage increased from 4.6 to 5.81v, while troubleshooting multi meter touch down on board and made a small short and now there is no longer a green light or orange coming from the MagSafe charger and now the dc in voltage is .481v. I am not sure on what is going on or where to start trouble shooting here, I could use some pointers in the right direction!\n\nthanks \n\nComputer cave"
