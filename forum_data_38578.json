        "message":"Hi Guys I have a 2838 that was just dead. No signs of liquid spil. Replaced U7201 and now i got fanspin and orange light, however its not booting. CPU gets hot, I have 32clk on Y2810. CPU Vcore is 1V (should it be 1.25?). Will check now U6100 but cant find i.e. U1900\/1950. Im not experience with these old boards, how should I troubleshoot this further?"
