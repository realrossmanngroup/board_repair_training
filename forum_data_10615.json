        "message":"i have a unit of 820-4924-A Logic board,condition is water damage,repaired somewhere else before,some chip burnt (seeing by physical) which i replaced,U5000 has been touched by someone before (not sure if it still working),i did reball it already,also U7100 cause the charger fuse to spoil,which after i replace,it doesnt happen anymore.\n\nNow when i plug in the charger and check,magsafe indicator show,sometimes green and sometimes orange,when its green,it will blink\nU7100 pin 2 - jumping from 16.62v to 16.69v\nU7100 pin 14 - jumping from 3.28v to 3.35v\nF7140 both side - 0.00v\nL7095 pin 2 - jumping from 3.401 to 3.402\n\ni dont have dc power supply for me to inject into the PPBUS_G3H so a bit hard for me to check,but im wondering if there is something wrong with the SMC IC U5000\n\nappreciate with any help,thanks"

Should draw a lot of Amps so make sure your power supply can deliver 10A+. First suspect to heat up will be the CPU and if it does this board is trash."
