It was booting fine albeit with camera not working if communication between PCH and camera IC was disabled (removing R2030 or removing the caps on the PCIe bus for example).\n- The clock did look fine on the oscilloscope, correct frequency and proper amplitude. Just a lower duty cycle than a known good board.\n\nAs a side note, removing camera RAM didn't change the symptoms, but once R2042 was replaced it booted fine without camera RAM. Obviously camera wasn't working, but after reballing camera RAM everything works.\nPrior to finding the bad R2042, multiple camera IC were tried by Alan. I tried a known good clean ME EFI and clock generator, they didn't solve the problem in this case but they could cause similar symptoms anyway.\n\nAccording to Alan, with verbose mode Sierra\/Mojave were freezing on\u202f:\n[CODE]AppleCamIn::init\nAppleCamIn::probe\nAppleCamIn::start[\/CODE]\n\nI booted Big Sur in verbose and I didn't get these messages, it was freezing at\u202f:\n[CODE]IOG Flags 0x3\nGeneration from SMC report as 2[\/CODE]"
