        "message":"A2159 came in for no power, liquid damage(see attached image).  I cleaned the corrosion from those two locations, and noted that the USBC pins on the power board were burnt from the event, so I replaced that board.  Machine now draws reasonable current, running at 20v properly.  I have a hot CPU, cooling fans, everything.  Startup chime sounds, caps lock working so I think the device is booted into the OS, but I have no touch bar operation(is completely black) and no video on the LCD panel, and no video output via USBc>>hdmi.\n\nWhere might I go on from here?"
