        "message":"[B]Device History: [\/B]\nUnit came into shop, with backlight on, but no image. During initial inspection, the unit did not power on. Tech had to do SMC reset, for it to turn on. After that, the no image issue, was caused by the LVDS cable. Tech installed the cable, ran a diagnostic. Everything seemed to be working okay. When client came in, the unit wouldnt turn on at all. No liquid damage\n\n[B]Current State: [\/B]\nCurrent via DCPS is 17mA. It does respond to the power button, by jumping to 150mA then dropping back to 17mA. It does respond to SMC reset, but not to SMC bypass mode\n\n[B]Measurements I've Taken: [\/B]\nPPBUS_G3H=12v59\nS5_PWRGD=3v4\nPM_SLP_SUS_L=3v3\nP3v3SUS_EN=3v3\nPP3v3_SUS=3v3\nPOM_RSMRST_L=3v3\nPM_PWRBTN=3v3\nPM_SLP_S5_L=0v0\n\nWhat other lines do I need before I have PM_SLP_S5_L?"
