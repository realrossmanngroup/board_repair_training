        "message":"Have 820-4924 with very mild water damage. When it came in it would get orange light on charger but board only draw 0.14 amps from power supply with or without battery.\n\nAfter replacing Q7520 C7571 C7116 and R7116 the board draws 2.9amps with battery plugged in and only 0.14 without plugged in. Battery is supposedly new. Heatsink gets very warm after few minutes with battery and charger connected but no fan spin.\n\nPPBUS_G3H 12.56v\nPP3V42_G3H 3.42v\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.33v\nPP5V_S5 5.5V\n\nCould this be bad battery or fan?"
