        "message":"Hey guys,\n\nworking on 820 3437 board, apparently no signs of liquid or kind of stuff and no components knock off. \n\nThis one sounds like a SMC problem. \n\nPPBUS - 8,23v\nSMC_RESET_L - 3.4V\n\nalready did the SMC dancing with Flux, already replace U7100 for a new one.. No changes.. \n\nMy question is, can i replace the SMC from a 820 000165 donor board??? or i will need to buy a 820 3437 donor board?? \n\nThanks"
