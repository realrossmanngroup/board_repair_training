Thing is , the speakers that were installed apparently were not good , also I was a bit confused when the earphones wouldn't work either , but I figured I had to manually flip the output to headphones before it worked . As for the speakers , I had to changer them again . removing the spears its quite an issue to , cus there's a higher chance of damaging them , in the process"
