        "message":"Hello, \nI am wondering is it possible to replace SSD IC's on this boards or they linked to the components on the board like an iPhone memory? If it is possible would be a donor board where I should look for this NAND IC's ? \nThe U9580 was liquid damaged and SSD lines PP2V5 are shorted to the ground, short check showing  NAND are dead warming up when 2 V injected to this line \nThanks for help"

        "message":"Yes, you can replace them.\nYou can buy complete kit on Aliexpress, already initialized.\n\nAlso can get them from donor board, not the same model.\n01041 and other models can serve for this purpose.\nBe aware to place them in the same sequence.\nIf your board has 5 NAND chips, need to remove and left empty the 5th one.\n\nBe aware of actual SSD size configuration of your machine, to get the correct replacement NANDs."
