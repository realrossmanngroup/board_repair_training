No water damaged. Never seen board so clean. costumer said best buy swap board for them few months ago.\n\nI press power button, it has 4 peeps then repeats. I have tried RAM just in case.\n\n3 short beeps and 1 little longer, then it repeats. \nAny ideas where to start? I tried to plug all the flexes."
