PPDCIN_G3H is not shorted.\n\nRead on another post battery is not required for this board. When battery is disconnected the board only goes up to 0.20amps and drops down to 0.02. No backlight on screen like when battery is connected.\n\nTried DFU restore which completely successfully since data was backed up prior to failure but no changes.\n\nWhat should be checked next?"
