        "message":"I am trying to learn about replacing the NAND on the new MacBooks, I have a programmer and it comes with some of the firmwares, not all but this is a start. The problem I am having is that according to the NAND models I have looked into so far the MacBooks I have looked at have weird storage sizes, for example on a A2289 the board comes with x3 TSB4226 this are 64Gb each and this board also has a TSB4227 this one is 128Gb and that comes to a total of 320Gb, however this Macs only came in either 256Gb and 512Gb and maybe 1Tb, can anyone please tell me what I am missing?\n\nThanks and if I can get any of this working I will post here."
