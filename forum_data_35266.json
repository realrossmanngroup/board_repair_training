(i'm trying to be as prepared as i can for when it comes back to me)"

Probably works fine until they move the unit, and it will get worse (until slot no longer works at all--three beeps, etc; assuming they deal with the inconvenience until it gets to this point). No sense in repairing it, tell them to max out top slot and call it a day. Otherwise it will be wasted shipping back and forth. Might even offer them $20.00 towards a RAM upgrade."
