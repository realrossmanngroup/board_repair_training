I want to be able to feed chatgpt the following, and have it learn how to solve board repair problems. At the very least, be able to answer entry level questions. 

1) Data from my web forum at https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/forums/macbook-logic-board-repair-questions.15/

2) Articles from my wiki at https://repair.wiki

On the forum, I want to give weight to answers by *dukefawks* and *2informaticos*

Once I have figured out how to do that, some sort of continuous system that keeps injesting data from the forum & wiki & sending it to chatGPT to be learned from would be amazing, but first let's get it to work at all.
