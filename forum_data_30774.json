        "message":"12\" MacBook works fine on El Cap then customer attemptes to install High Sierra. Bricked SSD.\nI am wondering if it's something to do with APFS \/ firmware.\n\n\nSomething I think is related:\nI have attempted on other systems to install High sierra on third party drives (SATA SSDs). They are not even detected by High Sierra installer when the SSD is fresh out of the box. The only way I have found to get these certian SSDs to recognise is to format them to HFS+ first with El Cap \/ other. When booting back into 10.13 installer they are then seem by disk util. I will not go into editing minstallConfig.xml to stop conversion to APFS on third party drives.\n\nNow. If an SSD is converted to APFS and I try to format the APFS drive back to HFS+ with an El Cap installer, disk util does not recognise the APFS volume.\n\nAPFS only works correctly with Apple SSD firmware. I wonder if this is all linked... Like a firmware update required for APFS to work, that fucks up for these 12\" MacBooks during the installation. Or some limbo state where neither El Cap \/ other or High Sierra disk utils can see the SSD?\n\nThis is a half arsed, uneducated theory. Does anyone have anythng more meaningful to add?...\n\nAside from \"Take it to Apple\" because clearly a \u00a31200 Mac should not fuck up after a couple of years. Yes I will be telling the customer to go to Apple as 6 years is the law for UK."
