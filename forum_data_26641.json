        "message":"okay thanks. the fan spins only for a few seconds then it stops entirely. i did replace the clock chip as it was nasty and there was stuff near smc so i guess i will try a reflow there.  for some reason when tracking down the issue with pp5v_s0 i found that slp_s3 was not there but i must be doing things in the wrong order. i will go through and if the smc reflow\/replacememt doesn't work i will replace everything with corrosion near it. \nThanks again."
