        "message":"Hi there,\n\ni have an Macbook 12inch 820-00244 which had a Water Damage. I have already changed U3100 and Q3100 because it had a short on PPDCIN_G3H.\nWhen i Changed U3100 i might have ripped of the TP_UPC_XA_DBG_UART_TX Pin. But i couldnt find it anywhere else on the Boardview. Is this Pin doing anything?\n\nAfter i have Changed those two chips i read the following Voltages:\n\nPPVBUS_LIO:5.20V\nPP3V3R3V0_AON:3.0V\nPP5V_G3H:0.2V \/ 6.62KOhms\nPP3v3_G3H:0V \/4.55KOhms\n\nWhat i Noticed is that i dont have R3061. It was missing from when i started trying to repair it.\nCan you help me out with this?\n\nGreetings from Germany"

Am i right with the assumption that this has to be there before I can even get PP3V3_G3H or PP5V_G3H?\nI measure only 1.4mV and 3.8KOhms to ground for PPBUS_G3H. The Line has a Capacitance of 1mF. Now Feeling a bit stupid for not measuring this in the first place.\nIs PPBUS_G3H also generated in U7000?\nSMC_BC_ACOK is at 0.002mV\n\nI hope its not U7000 because harvesting and reballing this from an Aliexpress Board seems like my personal hell.\nThis one wouldnt work?

When I did this i successfully got PP3V3_G3H and PP5V_G3H.\nI Get 0.2-0.3MOhms to Ground on PPBUS_G3H\nDo I see correct that U7000 only Generates CHGR_BOOT1 and CHGR_BOOT2 and Q7020 makes this PPBUS_G3H which then flows to the System and also back to U7000?\nOr is PPBUS_G3H also being created directly inside of U7000? Because i am getting CHGR_BOOT1 and CHGR_BOOT2 (both at 4.7V). Wouldnt that mean i either have a Problem with Q7020 Q7010 or with the Circuitry around it?\n\nI have Plugged in the USB C Charger again and the Voltage on PPBUS_G3H slowly (About 5 Minutes) rises from nothing up to 0.7 Volts when adding a bit of Alcohol on the Board. When its evaporated it decreases again. Should i try a reflow of U7000?"
