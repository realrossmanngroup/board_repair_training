        "message":"I have this board that was sent in from another shop. It appears as if there was liquid damage but not in the area of the LCD connector or the LP8545.\nI tested with another display I have and that one also had no backlight and I could see the flashing folder as well.\nBKL_EN measured 3.11v but when I measured R9704(BKLT_PWM) I got 0.008v.\n\nOn Pin 40 of the LCD Connector I was getting around 24v on backlight.\n\nI even ran a wire from pin 2 of R9731 to Pin1 of R9704 and when I measured BKLT_EN and BKLT_PWM they both measured 0v which looks like something is pulling those down.\n\nShould I replace the LP8545 or should I ultrasonic the board to make sure the U9600 chip is not the issue?"
