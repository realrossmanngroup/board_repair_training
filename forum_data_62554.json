        "message":"Customer brought in A1278 which was not loading system. I have noticed, that computer had Fusion Drive configured with SSD and HDD in optical drive bay. I took out both, put new SSD and cable, installed new Catalina which went smooth, but in the end computer started restarting. It was loading OS to arround 75% and turning off. I've Instpected board - looks perfect, no corrosion, dust, no damaged components. I have tried other HDD cable, other SSD, tried booting from external drive, changed RAM, tried with different slots, disconnected everything except LCD and trackpad - everything ends up with progress bar stuck at 30% or 75% (depening which version of OS I'm trying to run). I have already tried known good BIOS and new BIOS chip with no results. Verbose mode shows me such error (pic 0043). When trying to run ASD it shows another error (pic 0044)... Any ideas?\n\nEDIT: Computer has cracked glass, but customer claims it hasn't fell down. Maybe It's worth performing CPU\/PCH reflow?"
