        "message":"Hi Guys,\n\nWe have a MacBook that had a little bit of liquid damage around U9080 and was not powering. After cleaning the board, the MacBook now boots up but displayed the question mark folder. We have since tried to restore it and reinstall the OS via internet recovery and bootable USB but we cannot get past the activation screen as the wifi is not detected but we've connected to the wifi on the first screen. Any suggestions?\n\nAlso to add that there is nothing shown under start up disk - is this SSD failure?\n\nWe've checked the voltages for the SSD's against a good known board and these are all present. \n\nWe would appreciate any help please"
