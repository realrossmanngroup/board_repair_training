        "message":"Hello\n\nThe computer boots up and works fine with charger connected, if charger disconnected the computer wont boot and it shows the folder on the screen. \nI know might be the issue with these SSDs. This one also needs battery replacement. My questions are, \n\n1. If i replace the battery for a \"Status: normal\" one, will I still see the folder problem when not connected to charger?\n\n2. is this SSD reliable? Could it present more issues in the future? \n\n\nGracias!!"
