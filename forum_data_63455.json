        "message":"This board came in with extensive liquid damage in the USB-C, backlight, and ISL9240 areas. After clean-up I replaced ISL9240 and a few other corroded components. PPBUS was shorted to ground and I found U7210, one of the CPU power chips, shorted; replacing it removed the short on PPBUS_HS_CPU.\n\nNow, I get 20V on USB-C drawing 0.51A, PPBUS is 12.6V, and I have SSD and G3S rails. But no startup. DFU Restore proceeded to the padlock symbol, but the target computer showed no signs of life other than trackpad clicking.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best way to troubleshoot whether the short on PPBUS_HS_CPU has damaged the CPU, before I spend a lot of time fixing other issues on this board such as LCD backlight?"
