        "message":"Hi all,\n\nI have an [URL=\"tel:820-3115\"]820-3115[\/URL] that is completely dead.\n\nThis is the history so far:\n\n- No green light and 9 volts on pubs_g3h\n\n- Replaced ISL6259 because it looked like it had a hole in it\n\n- Green light restored\n\n- Powered up normally.\n\nI then plugged it back into the power supply and Q7085 started burning up then the whole thing died, so i replaced it and now i get nothing.\n\nNo green light, no voltage anywhere, on the power supply it just defaults to 2v and 1.14 amps.\n\nI assume the PCH and SMC are okay as it did power on but now i have no idea.\n\nI tried to inject voltage on the DC in fuse but again defaults to 2v and 1.14 amps.\n\nPP3V42 Resistance to ground = 041.8 ohms\nPPBUS_G3H Resistance to ground = 000.5 ohms --> i assume this is the problem but how can i check whats shorted if I can\u2019t inject voltage?\n\nAny ideas?"
