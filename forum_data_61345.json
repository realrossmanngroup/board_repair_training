        "message":"Arrived with fans spinning fast and SMC issue in Apple Diagnostic.\n\nU4402 was ripped off the board along with U5850. Fixed all the traces for U5850 but U4402 seems impossible. pads 6 and 7 are torn off with only the nittle nub remaining. These both only go under U3200\n\nIs there any other way to try and fix besides soldering wire to little nub with U4402 on top? Tried several times but fans continue to spin fast with SMC issue"
