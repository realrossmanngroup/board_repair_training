        "message":"Hi,\n\nboard came with no signs of life whatsoever, taking only 5V.. measured PPBUS and it was partially shorted (I kinda know this is not an easy one when it's a partial short) around 9 ohms in resistance and 0.012 in diode mode. \n\nInjected 2 volts since 1v was not enough and my initial suspicion was correct it was the haunted TPS62180.. and on board it looked little discolored to my on the visual inspection.. \nRemoved and replaced successfully now left ports take 20V for 2 seconds then switch to 5v and cycle.. on the right side it does not even power on the amp meter.. I replaced the CD3217B12 and it did not resolve the issue.. \n\nI measured the diode mode on the LDOs of CD3127 and it seemed OK according to OBD. Where do I look next?"
