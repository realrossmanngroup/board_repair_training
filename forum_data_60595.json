I tested it\non the backlight output i have 11.7V\ni have found out that if i measure r7702 on pin 2 (with a multimeter) the backlight starts working. So i changed R7702. But still the same issue.\nI have also changed the following parts: u7700, D7710, Q7701, R7701, C7700, Q7700\n\ni am a little lost. What could be the issue here."
