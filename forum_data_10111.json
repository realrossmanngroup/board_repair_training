        "message":"No liquid damage at all.\n\nCame in with no backlight.\nNo short on LCD connector.\nBeing brain lazy I replaced Q7701, D7701, Q7706, U7701.\nConnected new screen and sure enough it provided power to PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT.... Power to short the connector and kill the cable.\n\nReplaced Q7701, Q7706, U7701, got another screen on there, killed the connector but not the cable this time.\nChecked feedback, resistor values R7708 = 17k26 and R7709 = 149k5.\n\nCan't find a datasheet on U7750 LP5849 (could just be dumb).\nLED return resistors are all 0R. Schematic says LED return <in on pin 2 of each return and then on U7750 it says out, WTF.\nNo Idea what is going on here.\n\nAny help please?"
