        "message":"Good day\n\nI have a MacBook pro 15 inches A1707 (820-00281) stuck on 5V. One of the ports stays steady on 5V, while the other 3 ports are fluctuating, which I thought suggests the one that is stuck on 5V is the issue, hence the reason why I replaced it 3 times with 3 different known working CD3215, but still no changes, please advise, thank you."
