PP5V_S3 is missing and I have measure following values:\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.4\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.41\nPP5V_S5 = 5.02\nPP5V_S3 = 0\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.31\n\nU7201\nPin 12 = 3.41\nPin 13 = 1.99\nPin 21 = 3.41\nPin 22 = 3.32\nPin 23 = 8.40\nPin 29 = 5.02\n\nResistance to ground L7260 = 0.231 both sidesResistance to ground L7220 = 0.437 both sides\n\nSuggestions?"
