All of them can run 10.4 (Tiger) but only some of them runs 10.5 (Leopard)\n\nSo download the 10.4 (Tiger) operating system on some torrent site, burn it to CDs (or DVD but only the newer G4\u2019s has DVD drive), boot from cd by pressing \u201cC\u201d on boot up (or use boot manager by pressing \u201calt\u201d), install like usually following on screen instructions."
