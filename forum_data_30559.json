Those are my known-good test parts but it appears something about them being plugged in wouldn't let the board reset. No backlight still but other than that it seems good.\n\u2022 I replaced the LCD connector. No change.\n\u2022 The keyboard backlight is working.\n\u2022 LCDBKLT_EN_L is at 12.4V\n\u2022 0.3V on pin 1 of LCD connector.\n\u2022 Voltage present on pins 28-30.\n\u2022 F7700 is good. PPBUS voltage present.\n\u2022 SMC_LID is at 3.4V.\n\u2022 Data pins 3 and 4 have continuity to R7752 and R7753 and all the way through to pin 15 and 16 on U7700. Resistors are good.\n\u2022 3.3V on pin 8.\n\u2022 Known-good 2015 screen. Image present."
