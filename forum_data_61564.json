But after 10 seconds the same Talanoium Capacitor was short again. \n\nNow I removed C7582 and there is no fan spin no boot. \n\nThe light charger is red without batterij.\n\nI read from other threads\n\nU7100 \nPin 19 Diode mode = 0.456V (red probe on pin 19)\nPin 19 Diode mode = 2.3V (black probe on pin 19)\nPin 20 Diode mode = 0.456V (red probe on pin 19)\nPin 20 Diode mode = 2.3V (black probe on pin 19)\n\nU5110\n1 = 3.4v PP3V42_G3H\n2 = 0v\n3 = 3.5v\n4 = 2.2v\n\n8 = 3.3v\n7 = 3.4v\n6 = 3.4v\n5 = 3.4v\n\nAny help would be appreciate"
