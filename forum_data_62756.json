        "message":"Hi ive got an 820-01700 that had a short on U9580 with 0 volts when plugged in , i removed U9580 and short went away , now ive replaced U9580 and board powers to 19.6V then cycles off when it reaches 1.6a , under the thermal cam it shows U9580 and U9400 getting very hot so im guessing i have a duff U9400 , question is . Is it possible to replace this one the load a new os or would i have to replace them all or is this just now a dead board ?"
