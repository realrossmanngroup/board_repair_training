        "message":"Hi Team,\n\nI Have a 820-2330 that has no backlight:\n\nF9800 is OK\nat Q9807:\nPin 2 BKLT_PLT_RST_L, I have 3.298V\npin 5 LVDS_BKL_ON I have 0V that's why it can't provide a gnd for the Div bridge to be able to close Q9806.....\n\nNow the LVDS_BKL_ON line is directly provided by U9600, I've checked for eventual broken trace, but no........\n\nSo what would be the next step please? replace the U9600 or there is something else to check before doing that replacement as I'm not sure to have an U9600 is stock \/ donor board.....\n\nQuestion: should I plug the screen for the U9600 to send that signal?\n\nThanks, Gracias"
