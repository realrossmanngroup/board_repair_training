        "message":"Hello!\n\nThis board was clean or cleaned before I received it. Can't see any corrosion.\n\nIt does not charge the battery and it won't turn on from just power adapter.\nIf I install battery it goes to S0 state, but no CPU VCORE.\nFan is not running. GPU gets hot. \n\nMissing ALL_SYS_PWRGD so no CPUIMVP_VR_ON.\n\nI checked Q7950 and I have everything for ALL_SYS_PWRGD, but it stays at 0V.\n\nI checked:\n\nR7968\nR7966\nR7965\nR7964\nR7963\n\nand are all 0V.  However I'm sure I have PP1V5_S0 , PP5V_S3 etc. \nHowever P1V5S0_PGOOD, P5VS3_PGOOD etc. signals are 0V. \n\nI believe ISL fucked, but it looks clean. I checked sense resistors and traces and all looks ok.\nI have green light, but with power adapter I don't have PPBUS_G3H. It's like 1.8V.  With battery is all ok. \nNo short on PPBUS_G3H.\n\nShould I first fix the PPBUS_G3H issue?\n\nThanks."

        "message":"No use fixing PPBUS_G3H, it should run from battery. All PGOOD signals are tied together, so if one is pulling it down all will be low. Look at the diagram and measure all voltages that are required to generate ALL SYS PWRGD. 4 voltages on Q7950 and 3 on U7960 and all the PGOOD signals from regulators. \nSeeing as you are missing PPBUS_G3H and at least one PGOOD signal I would say this was a liquid damaged machine."
