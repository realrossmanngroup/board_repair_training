        "message":"Hi, got an 820-00165 with some small corrosion near SMC. I replaced Q5158, R5625, C5625, C5595 and there was a burned trace under pin 1 of R5100 which i wired to pin 2 of R5193. After this the fan spins up, stops, then turns on again and keeps running. The machine doesnt boot though, display stays black, no backlight. I have CPU Vcore and clock cycle. Any ideas?"
