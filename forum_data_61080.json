        "message":"I have  a liquid damaged board stuck at 5v. U3200 whats cycling on usb meter all other were 5v constant. I replaced U3200 and all are stable 5v. I check for shorts\/diode reading on all 4 CD3215's all were around the ,400 mark. I checked the ldos from all 4 and all are present except LDO_BMC 1.1v  on u3200 and U3100.\n3V3_G3H is present.\nPPBUS_G3H is 0v diode reading  .395.\nIm not sure where to look next as I cannot find any obvious shorts.\n\n\n\n--Just read a thread there similar. Going to replace both U3200\/3100 and see."
