        "message":"Hey, i just swaped an i9 logic board (donor MBP, drop damage) to a other case\/screen. Everyting works but the screen began to flicker, on the right side its a grey bar but you can still see the desktop. So bascially i thought its a dead screen, but one time after a SMC \/ PRAM reset the screen worked like a charm but went back to flicker a few minutes later.\n\nIs there something i can measure to be sure its a dead screen? A2141 is not known for Flexgate Issues right?\n\n[ATTACH]60438[\/ATTACH]"
