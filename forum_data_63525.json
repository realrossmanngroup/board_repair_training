        "message":"Hello, \nLooking for some help here , This macbook came  in dead , customer stated that it was charging and left connected overnight then the next day the computer was not coming on , I opened it and found U4910 and U4920 were both fried to ashes, When i ran a quick Diode mode only in that area I found that power rail PP1V8_MESA was fully shorted to ground , I then removed and replaced U4910 And U4920 and the short was gone , but the computer is still not  booting . I  measured PPBUS_G3H in diode mode and I got a value of 0.388 and in   voltage mode I am getting 12.25 V but my amp meter is still reading 5V I have not changed The USB Controller chips U3100 OR U3200\nPlease advice that would be highly appreciated.\n\nThank you very much"
