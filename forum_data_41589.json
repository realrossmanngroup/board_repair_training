        "message":"Hello,\n\nThe history with the MacBook Air is, the person was using on an airplane trip and it just died in their lap as they were using it.\n\n When I received it, it did not have a light on the MagSafe(using an apple original charger, not a knockoff).\n\n PPBUS_G3H had 8.19v, it should have been 8.6v which means SMC not talking to the ISL and it was missing the PP5V_S5 rail @c7505 as well. \n\nI have swapped the SMC and now have the correct PPBUS_G3H 8.56v @f7140 both sides and have my PP5V_S5 @c7505 as well now.\n\nMagSafe light does come on, green then turns to orange.\n\n\nI have all of the correct voltages on the S5 rails. \n\n\nI am missing PP5V_S4RS3 rail and turns out I am missing PM_SLP_S4_L.\n\n\n\nWhen checking around the U0500 (system power management) IN lines:\n\n@r5231 PCH_SUSACK_L 40mv\n@r1995 PM_SYSRST_L 57mv\n@r1962 PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK 0v\n@r1963 PM_PCH_PWROK 0v\n@r8133 PM_RSMRST_L 0v\n@r1802 PM_PWRBTN_L 3.4v\n@r5185 SMC_ADAPTER_EN 3.39v\n@r1410 PM_BATLOW_L 3.32v\n@r1450 PCH_DSWVRMEN 3.22v\n@r1451 PM_DSW_PWRGD 3.42v\n@r1452 PCIE_WAKE_L  3.32v\n\n\nI have PPVRTC_G3H 3.32v @r1450 so I assume the u1900 chip is working.\n\nThe board has no corrosion on it at all and no liquid damge.\n\nSMC chip did come from a donor board, so, maybe thinking in trying another?\n\n\nI feel, I am missing something dumb and my brain isn't clicking at all.\n\nWhat information can I get you?"
