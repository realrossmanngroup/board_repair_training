        "message":"Good morning, We get macbook pro with 820-4924 main board is after liquid damage \nafter main board cleaning was no green light or any live on MB, \nI measure voltages on MB and PP5v_S3 is missing \nPPBUS_s5_VS 12v\nS5_PWR_EN 0V\nSMC_Reset_L 3,3V\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN 0V\nPPVBAT_G3H_HGR_REG 12,10V\nmeasure on U8030\nP3V3 S0_EN 0V\nPM_SLP_S3_BUF_L 0V\nMeasure on U7510\n 23 12,2V\n22 3,3v\n\nLiquid damage was around SMC I reball  it. PCB checked underneath all ok pads ok  \n\nU8020 was corroded i replaced still no sign of live.\nAny idea what I should check, replace next in the row ? \nThanks"
