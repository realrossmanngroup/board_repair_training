So its not fully dead, but I smell corrosion, a bad solder joint or a part thats dying\n\nAny ideas?"

All termination resistors are OK and all traces are in tact (At least, to the furthest point I can measure without doing some magic BGA probe underneath the CPU :p)\n\nI just was about to give up after re-soldering U1900 because the solder connections have been touched by someone else before, until it actually turned on again! A full fan that kept on spinning. However after disconnecting the power and re-connecting it it once again stopped working.\n\nHow often does U1900 die?\nI know when replacing the U6100 BIOS SPI from a broken motherboard the the ME region gets messed up, but would it be good enough to verify if it actually was the chip? I just need it to pass S4 to make sure. A chime is the next goal\n\nEDIT: I'll just see if replacing U1900 changes anything. At this point I'm forced to replace something because just staring at it won't fix it"
