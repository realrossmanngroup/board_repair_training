So finally i checked that R6905, U6990 and U7600 were bad and i replaced them. Now i get green light on magsafe, ppbus and other rails are stable but it doesnt starts. Trying SMC bypass i get fans spinning but no chime no boot. \n\n\nIn SMC BYPASS all_sys is 0,03V.\n\nALso Checked u7000 17\/18 and 27\/28 are ok.\n\n\nAny idea what else can be checked?"
