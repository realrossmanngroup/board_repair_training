        "message":"I'd like to know what your input would be on this one. Firstly, I have above average circuitry understanding\/skills but I'm definitely no professional. That being said I've never worked on MacBooks and I'm not familiar with how they work. I have an A1706 that had components R6907 & D6902  were physically burned, but everything else on the board looks perfectly fine. There is no water damage or any other visible damage. U6903 is happily outputting 3.3V after my toasted component transfusion, but the board won't turn on. It stays at 20V @0.2A and never does anything. Here the information I was able gather so far about this board.\n\nPPDCIN_G3H = 20V\nPPBUS_G3H = 13V\nPPDCIN_G3H_CHGR = 20V\nPP5V_USBC_X_VCC = 5V\nPP5V_S4 = 5V\nPP5V_S0 = 5V\nPPBUS_HS_CPU = 13V\n\nSo those in my studies of this schematic seemed to be some of the main power rails for most of the voltage regulators on board yet I'm not getting any power to the following coils\/vregs\/lines\n\n\nPP5V_S4_X_USBC = 0V\nPP5V_S4_T_USBC = 0V\n(I feel like these need to be on 5V for the TBT regulator...but they don't come on. Why not? The 3215 seems to be function properly otherwise? Just conjecture on my part)\n\nLB700 = 0V\nL7210 = 0V\nL7410 = 0V\nL7420 = 0V\nL7430 = 0V\nL8410 = 0V\nL3500 = 0V\n\nBut all of those systems are getting their proper voltage inputs..... I know the TBT 5V has to be very important and it's not working.\n\nI'm extremely stumped. I cannot find a common denominator between the power supplies, or anything to do with the burned components. Ideas?"

You can find some for around around $30-$50 that'll do the job. \n\nThe way I've done this sorta job is use a programmer that connects to the JTAG connector on the board. Read the BIOS 3 times to make sure they all match and ensure a good read. Use UEFITool to clean ME region. \n\nIt'll take a little bit of googling but you'll figure it out. You do NOT need to remove an EFI lock. This is to clean the ME region of the BIOS which are two different things. I personally use the Medusa programmer but I believe it's possible to use the CH341A programmers with an adapter that fits the JTAG connector on the board."
