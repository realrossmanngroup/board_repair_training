        "message":"Hey, \n\nWorking on 820 3662, no signs of liquid or something like that. I was the first to open it and the board it's very clean! \n\nThis machine when i turn it off normally in osx and after that if i want to turn it on, the machine don't turn on... it's necessary to remove the battery, press for 5 sec button power and plug again ..  only this way it turn on again!! \n\nOtherwise everything works perfectly.. seems a bios problem. but i need yours opinion to solve this issue for the best way!  \n\nthanks"
