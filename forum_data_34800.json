        "message":"I have this board that doesn't show any signs of liquid damage. It shows a green light on the charger when plugged in but nothing else. PPBUS_G3H is 12.59v and there was no voltage on any of the S5 or S3 rails.\nI traced the issue to U7201 where there was 0v on PM_SLP_S4_L and SMC_PM_G2_EN. I went to the probe point(1227) that is next to the SMC(U4900) to measure SMC_PM_G2_EN and all of a sudden the fans spun and the CPU got warm.\nI turned unplugged the charger and plugged it back in but again no fan spin. When I touched the probe point with any metal the fan starts spinning again. There is continuity from that probe point to R7940. \n\nI haven't seen something like this before and don't know what I could do to fix this."
