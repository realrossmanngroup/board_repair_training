Now the trackpad works but the board only responds to the keyboard during pre-POST period (startup key combinations), nothing thereafter.\n\nI already tried a known good keyboard & flex cable, DFU Revive, and NVRAM reset. External keyboard works fine, too. Apple Diagnostics passes with no issues found.\n\nAny advice as to where to start testing?"
