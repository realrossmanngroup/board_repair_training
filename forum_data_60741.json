        "message":"Hello guys. the macbook air overheats and shuts down in about 10 minutes or less. When I connect the charger it gives me a green light and then a permanent orange but the fan does not move. I go to the U7100 do a reflow or replacement and the mac turns on normally but turns off again after a while and so on.\nA detail: When turning on with the charger connected, the battery increases the percentage of charge but the lightning does not appear inside the battery. After a while it turns off as explained above."

Fan ON and board started.\n\nIf there is no FAN spin at all, try exchange the FAN. If touchpad is disconnected, because of palmrest sensor, fan is going to run at full speed. If that is not the case, your fan is probably bad."

When I turn on SMC Bypass mode it doesn't do anything (the fan doesn't move at all) The heatsink looks perfect and I already changed the thermal paste. The only thing I have not done is clean ME BIOS. But I tried to reflow the wonderful U7100 and the machine started normally. I extracted the original .bin file from the bios in case something happens again.\nWhat is going to drive me crazy is how just by reflow the U7100 the machine comes to life again. Crazy my friend. Another recommendation if the machine dies again?\nThanks for your help."
