        "message":"This board had a lot of water damage in the area of the cpu\/gpu. The fans would spin and the heatsink would get slightly warm. While the liquid damage was still there I measured ppcpu_s0vcore and ppvcore_gpu and I got 0.83v on cpuvcore and I believe I had around 0.9v on gpuvcore(I am not 100% sure about gpu vcore).\nI removed the taped cover that is above the heatsink area and there was bad liquid damage under there. I replaced Q7510\/Q7550\/Q8930\/R7469 since they looked bad. I put flux and heated the rest of the areas that looked damaged then UC'd the board.\n\nThe fans still spin now but now I dont feel the heatsink getting warm. I have around 0.82v on ppvcore_s0_cpu but 0v on ppvcore_gpu and pp3v3_s0gpu also has 0v\nPin 1 of U9000 is 0v even with display cable plugged in.\n\nI'm not sure if any of those components I replaced caused this.\npp3v3_s0 present\nppbus_g3h - stable 12.6v\nPPVIN S5 HS COMPUTING ISNS - 12.6v\n\nHere were the areas I marked that had liquid damage before cleaning them.\n\nc8928 and c8923\nq7510\/q8930\nj5815\nu5860\nj4410\nc9820\nu7541\nc7576 and caps next to\n\nI did these measurements with no external components plugged in and with a genuine 85w charger."
