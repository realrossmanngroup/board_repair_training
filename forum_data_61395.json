        "message":"I'm familar with the logic boards that existed before usb C.  This data bus should be working with or without a battery? u7000 was replaced and the resistance of r5380\/r5381 both measure around 2k.  ppdcin is 20v and ppbus is 0v and I think it's because smbus_smc_5_g3_sda is missing. the battery has a charge and the data bus comes back when it is attached. this seems like a pmic issue"
