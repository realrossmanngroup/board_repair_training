        "message":"Hi guys!\n\nLong time lurker\n\nAnyways, I had a 820-4924 come in with liquid damage. Most of the damage looked like it was around thunderbolt related stuff. Went through the ultrasonic, fired right up... no SSD detected. Tested the SSD externally on my iMac and it works fine.\n\nChecked U3740\nPin 1: 3.4V\nPin 2: 0.1v\nPin 3: 0.1v\nPin 4: 3.3v\nPin 5: Ground\nPin 6: 0.1v\nPin 7: 0v\nPin 8: 0v\n\nPP3V3_S0SW_SSD_FLT I get 3.3v\n\n\nThings I replaced already... I started getting desperate.\nU3740\nR3741\nR3742\nC3740\nU3711\nU3710\nU8070\n\nBoth SSD_RESET_L and SSD_PWR_EN that are low appear to come from the CPU... which kind of worries me :(\n\nI'm not in front of the board anymore for the night but I will take any advice on where to go tomorrow."

I don't have another one of these boards to see if that part should be there or not... but it's the same thing on the 820-3536 board, missing but on the schematic."
