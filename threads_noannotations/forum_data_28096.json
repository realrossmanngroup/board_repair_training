        "message":"I\ufe0f think I\ufe0f know where this board is headed, but I\ufe0f just want to be sure as this is a weird issue. It\u2019s a mid 2010 13\u201d that gets weird black blocks on the screen and other graphic anamolies, and the ram all by the keyboard is bad. ASD gives Error 60 Video Controller Failure. The problem persists with know good ram in the top slot. When looking around the ram slot for stuck pins etc, I\ufe0f checked PP3V3_S0 for grins and found that it is only 3.17 V and shorted to ground. I\ufe0f have not gone through and checked everything that is on the rail but with the fact of the video controller failure and the MCP getting much hotter than the CPU after being on a few seconds is it a probable that the 3V3 rail is shorted under the MCP?\n\nApoloies for the weird characters seems the wonderous iPhone cannot type the capital letter i anymore!!"
