        "message":"Hello,\n\nThat board is missing the CPU power rail but it is in an S0 state.\nThe CPUIMVP_VR_ON signal is on at 3.3V\n\nCorrosion was worth between R2415 and C2411, on the probe point, rail PP1V05_S0_PCH_VCCDMI_FDI\nThis rail is at 0V.\nThat rail comes from PP1V05_S0 which is present at 1.05V\n\nProbe point is gone and I try to dig a small hole to attach a wire and reconnect it to the resistor and capacitor.\nIt seems that I did it but still no CPU rail.\n\nI've replaced since U7400 as well as Q7510 and Q7520 but no cigar.\n\nOne more thing... PPBUS_G3H is at 8.4V but SMC is on. Is that normal on the board?\n\nThanks!"
