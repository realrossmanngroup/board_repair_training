        "message":"Greetings from Australia !\n\nThis is my first post please be gentle ... however I'm ready to get fucked ..\n\nI've got a Macbook Air 13\" A1466 820-3209-A. I'm getting the green light on MagSafe (adapter sense working) however I'm getting no chime and no fan spinning.\n\nI've tested all major power rails and believe the board to be in a \"S0\" state. \n\nWhat should I test next? Thanks"

Ignore TBT rails since they are for thunderbolt.\n\nAlso, you said you believe the board is in an S0 state. Are S0 power rails present?"
