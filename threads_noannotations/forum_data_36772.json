        "message":"No trackpad and not all the keys work on keyboard. I replaced the keyboard and same issue. It turns on fine with power button but keys nor trackpad are working. Odd thing is im not getting pp3v3_s4 but i do get s3 and s0 state. Could explain why keyboard and trackpad arent working if the connectors arent being told to power on but then how would the power button work?\n\nIs this normal with newer models?"
