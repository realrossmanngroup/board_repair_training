        "message":"thank you for allowing me to participate in this Forum, as a hobby I delight in the repair of macbooks, I am a beginner, I have this macbook that I bought to try to get it back in operation.\nAt the first attempt it turned on it seemed to have a correct absorption of amps and seemed to charge the battery, from the beginning there seemed to be activity as the trackpad seemed to respond to impulses. Obviously it never turned on, no sound, the fans never turned. It does not heat in any point, observed with a thermal imager. A newbie question, does this type of macbook start up with no battery connected?\nI tried before and to perform other operations a DFU restore but it was not successful returning errors almost at the end of the process.\nThe logic shows no signs of the presence of oxides or liquids.\nIt has a strange behavior, without battery connected it remains stable at 20v but with variable absorption from 0.03A-0.07A if I connect the battery v from 20v to 5v, cyclically.\nHere are the measurements I made:\n[I]\nPPBUS_G3H - 12,60v\nPPBUS_HS_CPU - 12,60v\nPPBUS_HS_OTH5V  - 12,60\nPP5V_G3S[I]  - 5v[\/I]\nPP3V3_G3H_T - 3,3[\/I]\n\nAlso it has a strange behavior, a continuous variation of the voltage on r3460 and r3450, from 0.5v to 1.8v with continuous oscillation, I replaced u3200 and it is now stable on 0.8v\n\nI repeat, I am a beginner, forgive me if I make any mistakes in the description :giggle:\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60501[\/ATTACH]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][CENTER][\/CENTER][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]"
