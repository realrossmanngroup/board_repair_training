        "message":"Got another 820-01041 board that's not powering up. Initially, PP20V was 5v. Replaced UB300, which had a blowout on the surface. Once replaced, 20V was back. With the board back in the system, every few minutes or when I press the power Botton, the fan would spin up for about a second before it shuts off. I can also see a quick spike in current draw before it drops out. Here are the readings I have so far\n\nPPBUS_HS_CPU - 12.6\nPPBUS_HS_GPU - 12.6\nPPBUS_HS_OTH5V - 12.6\nPPBUS_HS_3V3G3H_T - 12.6\nPPBUS_HS_3V3G3HRTC_X - 12.6\n\nPP5V_G3S - 5.1\nPP3V3_G3H_T - 3.3\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC_X - 3.3\nPP3V3_G3S_T - 3.3\n\nPP5V_S4_T_USBC - 0 (does not spike up when there board does draw current for a second)\nUPC_T_5V_EN_R - 0 (does not spike up when there board does draw current for a second)\n\n\nPM_RSMRST_L goes to 3.4v for 10 seconds after 20v power kicks on then turns off after 5 seconds. \nUPC_T_5V_EN stays low the whole time\n\nSMC_PCH_PWROK - also spikes to 1.79 but drops out within less than a second.\nSame with SMC_PCH_SYS_PWROK, SMC_SYSRST_L.\nSMC_RSMRST_L stays at 1.79 for about 4 to 5 second before it drops out.\n\nPPVCCIO_S0_CPU - 0.9 during the current draw and drops to zero within a 2 seconds\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 1 during current draw and drops to zero within a 2 seconds\n\nWhat else should I check or any suggestions"
