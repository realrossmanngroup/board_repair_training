        "message":"I have an 820-00165 MacBook Air 2015 board liquid damaged with green light\/no power\/no fan. Damage was centralized on U7501.  Via to C7500 to pin 23 on U7501 burned.\n\nReplaced U7501. Voltage at pin 14 on U7501 .75v before chip changed. No change in voltage after chip changed, still .75v\nReplaced C7500 & C7503\n\nRestored via with jumper on pin 23. Now have restored 8.65v after jumper installed.\n\nPP5V_S5=.75v measured at C7505\nPM_SLP_S4_L=0v\nS5_PWRGD=2.96v\nPM_DSW_PWRGD=3.42v measured at R1451\nPP5V__S4RS3=0\nPPVRTC_G3H=2.88V measured at R1450\n\nAny thoughts on what I need to track down to get this thing to turn on?"

I was looking around for something that was getting hot but couldn't identify anything. I injected voltage to the PPBUS_G3H line and slowly added voltage up to 1v.  The CPU was heating up but I couldn't find any components that were hot via the old alcohol trick.  I plugged in the AC adapter and the green light came on and then I heard \"pop\".  The top of the CPU popped off right under the microscope.  What transistor allows voltage to pass directly to the CPU? This repair has been a PITA."
