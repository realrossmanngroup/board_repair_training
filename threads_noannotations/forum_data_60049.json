        "message":"Hi All! I have a fun one here which hopefully someone can tag the issue. (Also glad to be back, signed up my early days 2 years ago and was NOT ready for advanced troubleshooting haha).\n\nOriginal Problem: Liquid damage (where exactly... hard to say. The board is pretty clean and it sat on my shelf for over a year lol). \n\nThis unit is sluggish, with a sluggish cursor inside the OS. It is fine in the boot menu, ASD menu, etc. \n\nI have: \n- Cleaned in ultrasonic\n- Swapped trackpad & cable\n- tested with everything else unplugged\n- tested with an external mouse\n- reballed SMC (have no replaced it though)\n- loaded a clean ME BIOS\n- Checked all the traces for the different thermal sensors\n- Replaced a couple of the thermal sensors just because\n- Loaded up Hardware Monitor and all temps are reading normal\n- Applied new paste to the heatsink\n- Replaced Q5520\n- Installed a fresh OS on my test drive\n\nNo luck so far. Please, for the sake of my sanity... any tips?"
