        "message":"Hello,\n\nI received a board from a new m1 mbp that had some liquid spill on it, pp3V3_S2 was shorted because of UL000 that was dead, after removing it the board do the chime, but has no display or caps lock, but trackpads clics, I cannot find another UL000 (wifi\/bt module) because I cannot find any donor board or chip, but I don't think that the board need that chip to boot.\nWhen plugged to an external display, we can actually see the apple logo, the machine will go to 10% of the progress bar and then shut down.\nSENSOR_PWR_EN is power cycling every 10-20s, and that is making all the current sense cycling too... I'm suspicious about u8100 being bad but that would be data gone, can something make u8100 cycle ?\nCPU\/GPU are getting hot and cold (cycle).\nDFU mode is impossible because the board is cycling.\nWhere should I start from there ?"

My PP3v3_S2-WLBT_ISNS was short on CL053 (underfilled area). ISO did not do it because the temp on damage was low (cycling). Do you have possibilities to use a Thermal camera?"
