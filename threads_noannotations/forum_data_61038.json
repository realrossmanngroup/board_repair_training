        "message":"Hello. I am usually pretty good at fixing 5v issues on touchbar machines, but this one has got me stumped. This board had very minor liquid damage in some small areas around the board. It takes steady 5v on all 4 ports and the amp draw fluctuates between 40-60ma. U3100 has some minor corrosion around it so I changed it but it did not make any difference. I do not find any shorts and PP3V3_G3H is present at 3.4v on all 4 ports. I compared diode mode reading on all the LDO lines for the CD3215 and they all match. All 4 chips produce their 1.1v LDO rail, so it does not seem to be an issue with the CD3215's. Despite this, I still replaced the other 3 CD3215's just in case but still have the same issue. I figured it must be an SMC issue, so I replaced the SMC from a donor board of the same model, but still same thing. All 4 ports still steady 5v and 40-60ma. SMC_RESET_L and BUF_SMC_RESET_L are both preset at 3.3v and PPBUS_G3H is ~10mv and is not shorted, so I don't know what else could be wrong. Is there something else I should check?"

I also replaced U7000 just in case, but no change. R\/C\/Q7030\/40 seem to all be ok. All 4 ports still takes 5v and amps cycle between 40-60ma. One thing I did notice is that when its using only 40ma, SMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SCL and SMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SDA are 3.4v. Then when it goes to 60ma, both of those voltages drop to around 0.5-0.8v, then go back to 3.4v when the board goes back to 40ma current draw."
