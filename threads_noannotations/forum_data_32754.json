        "message":"Hi. I have 15\" Retina with 820-3787 board that functions normally (green\/orange light, boots, charges, etc..) Last night while it was fully functional I closed the lid on it to put it to sleep. This morning I came in and there is no green\/orange light on charger and wouldn't turn on. The only way to get it turn back is to disconnect and reconnect the battery. After this everything works normal again. This happened numerous times. No liquid damage. Any idea where to start?\n\nThank you, have a good one!"

If I let it go to sleep or shut the machine down while on battery, I cant turn it back on or do I get a green light unless I disconnect the battery, drain power and reconnect the battery. Then it starts back up. \n\nHave a good night\/day!\n\nUpdate 2 - Reballed SMC - now 9\/10 in constant boot loop with crash error GPU panic as well. \n\n\n[URL]https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/20Giqx42lssPSk6E2[\/URL]"

Once that is done i can plug battery back into the board and it will power on again.\nThanks.\n\n-----------> [url]https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/g888OHnKEtdE2k7i1[\/url]"
