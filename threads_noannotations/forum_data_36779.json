Replace U7100 to correct this issue.\n\nWith the battery plugged in, the MagSafe flashes (long green, then short green, then repeat). Laptop powers up still and runs, but battery won't charge. Runs fine with only battery or MagSafe, but once both a connected, the blinking starts. \n\nI've replaced U7100 x2 to confirm not defective. Current sensing resistors measured good and traces to U7100 also good. \n\nOnce i turn the board off, it comes back on once the MagSafe cycles through the blinks. What what i can tell, data is being sent through SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA."
