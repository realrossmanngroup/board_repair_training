        "message":"Hi, \n\nI have an A1708 820-0840-A that hat a very small liquid contact, and  has no power. Ampmeter stays black, and i get no voltage on F3000.\nC8167 was oxidated and i removed (looks that was the only point with liquid contact).\n\nAfter removing C8167, i notice that PP3V3_S4, on diode mode, and ohm reading oscilates a lot (diode readings oscilates bettwen 0.485 and 0.086. ohm reading oscilates bettwen 45k ohm and 5k ohm).\n\nCan you help?"
