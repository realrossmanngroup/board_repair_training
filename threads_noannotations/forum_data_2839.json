        "message":"Hi guys,\n\nThis 820-2915 came in with green light and most voltages present, I say most cause since its not powering on something surely is missing.\n\nIt seems it was LD through the USB ports side - no extreme corrosion present - I UC it before anything else.\n\nPPBUS_G3H at 12,5V\nPP3V42_G3H at3,41V\nP3V3_S5 also normal\nBattery pulses are present - I assume this means the SMC is working and tries to talk to the battery\nand there is a green light...\n\n\non the other hand\nSMC_RESET_L is constantly high\n\nalso PPVBAT_G3H_CONN starts at 12,5V and drops to 5V so does CHGR_BGATE, then it repeats as long as the PSU is connected.\n\nI replaced U7000 already and measured the two current sense points with normal values.\n\n\nEDIT1: I measured around and found PP3V3_S4 to appear at some point but at 0.5 to 1.5V and fluctuating. The PP3V3_S4 FET and its surrounding components are missing - still looking to see where this comes from.\n\nEDIT2: PM_SLP_S4_L not present at R7913\/pin2.\n\nWhy all the funny ones come to me? I mean I really need one or two with just a blown BKL fuse to maintain mental health...\n\nthanks in advance guys."
