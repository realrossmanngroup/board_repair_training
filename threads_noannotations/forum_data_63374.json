        "message":"Came in today for \"wont turn on\"\n\nTried iit nothing happens,. Open back and battery looks swollen., remove battery and pop in new one,. Works perfectly, but slow due to 2gb ram only,. so I upgrade the RAM.\n\nBoots fine runs fine but I notice Pink tinting to screen and slight graphics glitches souse Medusa to to kill AMD and remove R8911. Machine boots fine and only showinng Intel chip. I update OS and check battery is charging ok all is good so shut it down,. \n\nCome back to it today to test before giving it back and It wont power on. All I get is a quater fan spin endless loop.,\n\nIve tried evreything I can still no dice, \n\nBoard alone on the desk nothing connected just the original 2gb ram I get constant quater fan spin loop and following Big coil voltages,\n\n\nL7220 - Pulses on fan spin\nL7260 - Solid 3.33v\nL7550,L7510,L7520,L7530 all 0v\nL7030 Solid 12.55v\nl7630 Pulses\nL9510 - 0v\nL7330 Pulses\n\nAny ideas dude?"
