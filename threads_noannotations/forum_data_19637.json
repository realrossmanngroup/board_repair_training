Looking at the schematic could a faulty ISL6259 cause improper signaling to Q7130 (which looks like it creates PPBUS_G3H) and that cause the fluctuations on PPBUS_G3H? Is there anyway to meter CHGR_LGATE and CHGR_UGATE to know if the ISL6259 is working properly to communicate to Q7130 how long to pulse to make PPBUS_G3H?\n\nUsing a different charger (both are OEM) I get about an 11 second fan spin, then off and then on for a split second and then off again permanently."
