After replace and U.S cleaning the board. It back to life. \nWorked for a week and than died again, but completely as it still turn on and login to the system. Sometimes stay 1 hours working before freeze and restart. \nAslo I notice that it won't turn on just on charger. It needs the battery connected to turn on, but it is charging."
