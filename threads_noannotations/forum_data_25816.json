        "message":"Hi, I have this board from another shop. It is very clean. Nothing visually wrong with it as of now. Dont think it even had liquid damage. Without battery green light turns amber after a couple seconds. I dont know much more as of yet. Im getting this in now in case you see this so I have an idea what to look for in the morning. I do know I have all G3H, PP3V42, PP18VDCIN, PPVRTC (16.5V) and PP5V_S5 & PP3V3_S5. I also know Im missing S4 power.Possible SMC issue most likely because of amber light? Thank you, have a good\nnight\/day.\n\n\nUpdate 1 - Missing PP5V-S4. Missing P5V_S4_EN.\n\nU7970\n\npn 6 - 3.3V\npn 2 - Low (0V)\npn 1 - (SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN) Missing.\n\nSMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN Diode mode - .667\nL4901 3.4V\n\n\nUdate 2 -\n\nTried reflow on SMC. No change.\nReballed SMC - No Change.\n\n\nThanks."

The only time the light will hold solid green is WITH a battery when fully charged.

I just like re-balling shit...\n\nHonestly I thought since I was missing SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN for P5V3V3_S4_EN that SMC would be possibility since thats where it comes from and i may as well try it. PPBUS is 12.56V and PPVRTC is fluctuates from 16.18 to 16.435V. I'm assuming you meant U2600 and U2650? U2600\/50 both look good .99 to .107 on pin 8 U2650. No power cycling on P5V_S4. U6100 looks good. R5021 - 24Ohm, R5022 - 43Ohm, R5023 - 15Ohm R5024 - 15Ohm.\nThanks Duke.\n\n[USER=\"893\"]2andrewd[\/USER] -\nThank you.
