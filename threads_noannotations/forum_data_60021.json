        "message":"I've been lurking long enough and need to get into the mix.  Thanks for all of the advice before this thread, because it got me here today.\n\nCustomer brought in an A1990 with board 820-01814A.  It's stuck at 5V pulling .225A.  All 4 USB-C ports have been tested; only 3 were functional.\n\nI'm using the schematic for a 820-01041.  No spill damage*; this is a super clean board.\n\nOff the bat, UB300 was visibly fried, and components CB3902, RB258, CB313, CB314, CB301, & R4808 all appeared bad or burned with a small amount of what looked like corrosion.*  All of those components were removed.  RB258 & R4808 were replaced with new resistors.\n\nMany 3V3 rails are present, but no 5V rails.  I thought this was beginning to sound like a T2 firmware issue, so I started down that road as well.  Using Apple Configurator 2, I've tried the Actions -> Advanced -> Revive Device option several times with the target machine successfully in DFU mode.  No joy...\n\nPPBUS_G3H:                         12.3V\nPPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG:  12.3V\nPP3V3_G3H:                          3.399V\nPP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO:          3.366V\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO:          3.375V\nPP3V3_TBT_X_SX:                 1.668V\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC_X:             3.398V\nPP3V3_G3H_SOCPMU:        3.324V\nPP3V3_AWAKE:                     3.323V\nPP3V0_G3H_RTC:                 3.007V\nPMU_ONOFF_L:                    3.373V\nPMU_ACTIVE_READY:          1.8V\nPMU_LDO2_OUT:                 1.8V\nPMU_VDD_MAX:                   3.368V\nPP1V1_SLPS2R:                     1.104V\nPP1V8_SLPS2R_PMUVDDGPIO  1.806\nPP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS:      5.17V\nPP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS:      5.14V\nPP20V_USBC:                        5.17V\n\nMissing:\nPP3V3_S0SW_TBT_X_SNS  (Diode Mode: .605V)  (Ohms to GND: 27.82k)\nPP3V3_S5                             (Diode Mode: .328V)  (Ohms to GND: 10.45k)\nPMU_PVDDMAIN_EN         (Diode Mode: .767V)  (Ohms to GND: 47.2k)\nPP5V_S5_LDO                     (Diode Mode: .490V)  (Ohms to GND: 21.k)\nP5VG3S_EN                         (Diode Mode: .592V)  (Ohms to GND: 46.4k)\nPP5V_S4_X_USBC               (Diode Mode: .502V)  (Ohms to GND: 16.44k)\nPP5V_S4_T_USBC               (Diode Mode: .504V)  (Ohms to GND: 16.64k)\nP5V_3V3G3H_EN                (Diode Mode: .596V)  (Ohms to GND: 50.4k)\nPM_SLP_S4_L                      (Diode Mode: .808V)  (Ohms to GND: 88.5k)\nPM_SLP_S5_L                      (Diode Mode: .806V)  (Ohms to GND: 86.7k)"
