        "message":"Coffey spill. But board did not get too much damage seemingly. Only obvious thing was a cap (C1910). I changed that. After that it did catch green light, it even started okay with lcd. Then I connected the battery (which had corrosion before on the logic board part ). After that the green light went away and never came back. Probably battery is fried too....\nTried other DC board too...\n\nNow:\nPP3V42 is missing\nPPBUS is missing\nPPDCIN_G3HOT is missing\nACOK is missing\n\nResistors around ISL are fine (R7105, R7121\/22, R7151\/52), though ISL got some coffey on it.\n\nClues?"
