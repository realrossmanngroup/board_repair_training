        "message":"Hi, \n\nI have got 820-2914-a that is not turning on. No light on magsafe. Checked ISL62 and it seems be ok. Reistance between 17\/18 and 27\/28 is fine. \n\n\nPPBUS is los 1,7V\n\nPPDCIN_G3H is fluctuating from 16,8 to 17,1.\n\nChecked resistance arroung ISL and also didnt find nothing wrong. \n\n\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.45V. \n\nBefore checking S3 and S5 lines. Is there any idea why it is fluctuating if ISL and all componentes arround are ok?\n\n\nThanks"
