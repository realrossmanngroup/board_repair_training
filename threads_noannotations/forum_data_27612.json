As that could explain why the cpu vcore would not activate\n\nI'm a bit confused on why removing R8167 would solve the no S0. As far as I can see R8167 is a pull-up resistor for the ALL_SYS_PWRGD line. I'd recommend getting it back on. You might not be able to see the _PGOOD lines being high or low without it"
