No shorts anywhere that I can see.\n\nFor main voltages I'm referring to the things I would normally expect to be in place for the board to switch out of an S5 state. PPBUS, 3V42, 3V3_S5, 5V_S5, voltage to the SMC. Nothing seems off which is why I was wondering if that slightly lower measurement on the resistance to ground for vcore might be an indicator of what the problem might be. Not sure where to look next."
