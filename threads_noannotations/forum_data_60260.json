In fact, I ordered a PC motherboard to test this processor and I will probably have it on hand tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. I will also have another CPU in the next few days.\nI tested the logic board with the resistor R6903 in place (as suggested and shown in the schematics) and led # 2 stopped looping on and off.\nPP12v_S0 is present and stable.\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU gradually goes up to 1.5V.\nPPVAXG_S0 gradually goes up to 0.6V.\nThe board is consuming a constant 0.9 amps at the 12V input.\n\nSome questions:\n1) Is it normal, in this situation, for all voltages to appear without the SMC_ONOFF_L signal being set low? Why does the board go to the S0 state? Perhaps a wake event set by the PCH?\n2) Although I am still not sure if the CPU went bad, what should I check before placing another CPU on this board? I wouldn't like to kill a new CPU for some silly oversight.\n\nThanks!"
