        "message":"Hi guys,\n\nGot an 820-00840 that I got for new screen (usual flexgate problem)\n\nNoticed that machine has a 'cold boot' issue where it randomly powers off or restarts during use, especially when cold booting. First few times it struggles to even get to login screen.\n\nAfter a warm up period is seems far less frequent.\n\nHaving opened her up, noticed a very small amout of corrosion around U7370 and L8030 \/ Q8030.\n\nHave flux and boiled these 2 spots, but now board is stuck at 20v 0.03A. Trackpad clicks when plugged in but CPU does not get warm.\n\nI have checked and have no VCORE voltage present at L7210\/20.\n\nFrom reading other threads I have noticed that L8060 and L7900 seem to have lower than expected resistance in diode mode (0.036v and 0.086v)\n\nAny suggestions?"
