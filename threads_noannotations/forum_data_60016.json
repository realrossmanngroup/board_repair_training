        "message":"Hello\n\nI have this logic board that originally came in with not powering from usb-c but from battery, and also not seeing SSD. Fixed the usb-c issue by replacing U3200\/3100 and the ssd was due to R9350 being knocked off. But now I'm dealing with fan spin issue. I slowly ramps up to high fan spin. unfortunately i didn't power on the board before fixing the other issues, so not sure if the fan issue was there previous. \n\nI also found R6051 knocked off (for smc fan 1 control), replaced. \n\nTheres no sign of liquid damage or corrosion. I'm getting a 127 degree reading on HWMonitor app for Airport and Heatpipe Outgoing Air sensor. I've checked all 3 thermal sensors (q5871\/2\/3) under diode mode and they all read 0.64 at U5870 pins 6\/7, 8\/9, and 10\/11.\n\nAny suggestions?"
