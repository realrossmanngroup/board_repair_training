        "message":"Hi Guys,\nI am working on a Customers 820-00928 board that will not power on and shows Low Battery icon. Machine Boots up in SMC Bypass Mode but does not see any battery? PPBUS_G3h is 13.02V  With Battery Connected while running in SMC Bypass mode and PPBUS_G3h is 12.58V while machine is off and charger plugged in with battery connected. An original 87w Charger is being used and battery is Good. I tried the machine with a different 820-00928 Board and Machine starts right up without Problems. All 4 USB_Chips are good and getting 20V on the AmpMeter...No Liquid Damage anywhere on Board. I\u2019m also getting the following measurements...\nPM_BATLOW_L. 3.3V\nSMC_ONOFF_L 3.1V\nPM_RSMRST_L  3.29V while Running  and 0V before boot up\nPM_PWRBTN_L  3.19v\n\nAny Suggestion where to start looking? ANY help would be Greatly Appreciated...Thank You"
