        "message":"hello guys, have got n 820-00850 that would not power on charger but works 100% on battery . I do not seem to fully understand the 2018 model of operation , I measure 12.30V on PPBUS with charger only connected and 5V in PPDCIN, I have checked for a short to ground but no short, the only thing I could notice is 0V at CHGR_RST_IN, I don't know if that's suppose to be high like CHGR_RST_L signal . I believe when any of the CD3215s are faulty , the machine wouldn't power with the battery either, please correct me on this , as I could be wrong"
