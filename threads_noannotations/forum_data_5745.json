R7105 = 20ohms.\nThis is power to the chip through series resistor maybe?\n\nPin 17 to 18 = 3.5ohms\n\npin 27 to 28 = Xkohms EDIT: it was 2k (replaced R7121 & R7122 with 10ohm). Pin 27 to 28 now 20ohms\nI'm guessing that these are coming off the current sensing resistor to a differential amplifier or comparitor on the 6259?\n\nVoltage at pin 20 = 5V\n\n[B]Additionaly[\/B]\n\nJust checked gate volatges again after replacing resitors with correct values. Pin 24 = 8.6V and pin 21 = 0.5V\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.6V...... But err, no turn on.\n\nThank you, I'll keep digging into this board. The soldering was done rather well by whoever fucked this board with the wrong values in all the wrong places. This is kinda shitty as I can't see just by looking, what has been done.\n\nThanks again, I'll be posting again soon I expect"

        "message":"Thanks to louis for the youtube and thanks to everyone giving thier time and knowladge.\n\nBoards a worker. There were no S0 enables so I injected S0 enable 3.3v but still no S0 rails turning on. Turns out the fault was U1900 had been soldered to the board incorrectly!\nAll of these boards are from a company that buys from a company the \"refurbishes\" damaged Macbooks and laptops. This is not a small company so it begs the question of who are they employing to fuck shit up even further... 80% of the boards have been ruined by a moron and after 3 months of board repairs I am fixing 90% of what they can't, plus undoing thier stupidity. What's up with that.\n\nAgain, thank you"
