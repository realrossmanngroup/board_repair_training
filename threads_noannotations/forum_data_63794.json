There is no short on this line, resistance is 112kohm.\n\nSome measurments:\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12,60V\nPP3v3_G3H_RTC = 3,390V\nPP3v3_G3H_PMU_VDDMAIN = 3,355V\n\nPP3v3_S5 = 0V\nPP3v3_S5 = 112kohm\n\nPP2v5_NAND_SSD_0 = 2,52V\nPP0v9_SSD_0 = 0,90V\nPPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0 = 1,80V\n\nI have managed to get in DFU mode, but same error message appears like in recovery mode:\n\nThe operation couldn\u2019t be completed. (AMRestoreErrorDomain error 75 - Failed to handle message type StatusMsg (Missing data volume)) [AMRestoreErrorDomain \u2013 0x4B (75)]\n\nIn my opinion the U7800 is faulty, because it is not producing the PP3v3_S5 line. Am I right?\n\nWhat do you think guys?"
