        "message":"I'm working on a A1989 with 820-00850-A. The machine came with the following issues: Camera not working, all four USB-C Ports not working and the battery needs to be changed. This Macbook was the dirtiest one I've ever seen. The entire machine was completely full of dust inside.\nThe contacts of the four USB-C Ports was heavy damaged and some of them was also shorted together. I think this came from a non original Charger or adapter. After cleaning the machine and changing the DC-In Flex-Cabels the MB works fine. Only the Camera issue is still present.\n\nALS is working.\nI tried a known good Display\/Camera - same behavior.\nThe Oszi shows no Datacommunication on I2C_FTCAM_SCL and I2C_FTCAM_ISOL_SCL.\nI2C_FTCAM_SDA and I2C_FTCAM_ISOL_SDA looks normal.\nI changed the U8502 without any effect.\n\nPP1V8_G3S = 1.80v\nSEP_CAM_DISABLE_DFF_L = 1.80v"
