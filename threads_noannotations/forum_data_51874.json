Refuses to be detected in two good machines that detect other SSDs. I can recognize some data-lines here, but unsure how to interpret them. I'm assuming a schematic for the SSD itself doesn't exist, so looking to see if there are any obvious places to start checking boardside on J3700 with the SSD plugged in. 820-3662 board.\n\nedit - if not clear, fully aware this is an SSD-side issue. Wondering if there's any luck with repairing the SSD itself."
