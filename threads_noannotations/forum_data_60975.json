        "message":"Got this old machine with battery status indicator shorted and unable to boot. Fixed the battery charge indicator that solved the issue. Left off charge for 1 day performed a PRAM reset than stopped power on again with battery connected. Took out the logic board didn't start as well so I try the bench power supply and got it run. Now without battery seems to power on just with the bench supply no way to get it boot with the original 85W adapter wich shows as usual the green light once conected and orange one when the battery is also present. Green\/Orange light works just fine. I just noticed that is also able to start with a 60W original adapter with a replaced (knok off) power cable that usually pretend to be an 85W genuine adapter."
