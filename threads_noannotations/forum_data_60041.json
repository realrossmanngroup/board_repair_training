        "message":"So on the bench I have an 820-2532 with a strange issue. It is usually drawing 40mA and not powering on, so I checked power rails and am missing PP5V_S3. I removed L7220 and injected 5v to mimmic the 5v rail coming from U7201 and then triggered SMC_ONOFF_L and the board started. I removed the wires and put L7220 back on, try it again and the board fired up. Well after the board cooled off, it would no longer start, so I back to square one. I took my heat gun and heated the areas again and lo and behold it started again. I'm beginning to suspect a bad cap."

Just out of curiosity, are there any measurements that can be done to confirm this is a fix either way? I understand that the proof is the computer is now running, I was thinking about for the sake of being able to measure something."
