        "message":"This arrived with no power and no visible signs of liquid damage. PP3V8_AON was slightly shorted at 0.172 diode and 0v on arrival. Q5800 was causing the short. Replaced Q5800\/Q5820\/Q5840 and U7500.\n\nShort is gone however PP3V8_AON is only 1.4V now. Under thermal camera something around Q5800 is getting hot however I have already replaced Q5800 twice.\n\nWhat should be checked next?"
