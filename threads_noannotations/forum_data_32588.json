It was jumping around with the old battery, so I changed it in hope it would resolve the issue.\n\n[QUOTE=\"ALB-Repairs, post: 32602\"]Not sure on the technicality of it all, but if you remove the charger i bet it stops?\nis the charger well grounded? Magsafe screwed in? all trackpad screws present .ect? [\/QUOTE]\n\nI know what you're thinking here, low voltage and over current from shit charger causing trackpad to jump about. Remove charger and all good.... It's not that either.\nAnd yes, yes, all good.\n\nI will slap a new trackpad in there along with a cable and see what happens.\nSeen plenty of jumping trackpads but I have not seen this before where brushing the trackpad helps. Fucking odd."
