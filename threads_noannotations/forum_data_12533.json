I'd recommend trying a bootable to rule out it being a failed SSD or corrupted software... if the same thing happens, pop it open and try it with just the bare minimum plugged in, keyboard, lcd, and charger. I had a retina that did this and it was actually the wifi card being plugged in that was preventing it from booting. A new wifi card fixed my problem. Just sharing experience, good luck!"
