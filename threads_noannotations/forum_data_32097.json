        "message":"Pin 3 is the VIN, voltage in pin. We expect here DC in voltage or battery voltage. The battery is 11-12v, the DC in voltage should be 16v.\n\nPPDCIN_G3H_OR_PBUS goes through R6990 to send 16v to the voltage in pin. It also goes through R6993 to enable the chip to turn on.\n\nSince pin 2 is 16v, I can assume that PPDCIN_G3H_OR_PBUS is present. \n\nSince pin 3 is 3v, I can assume that either one of two things is true.\n\n1) C6990 is short circuiting pin 3 of U6990 to ground.\n2) R6990 is blown.\n\nIt is possible both of the above are true. What is the resistance of R6990? What is the resistance to ground at pin 3 of U6990? Measure without power applied of course."
