        "message":"Hello,\nthis 820-2915-B has no Backlight. No waterdamage or other visible damage on the board. I measured around and BLK_EN is only 3.0V. I chekhed the voltage divider (both resistors are fine) and came to PPBUS_G3H. It is only 12.22V. I can clearly see it working on the screen and i can use it with an external monitor. Everything else works fine. I tried a different screen and still no light. I already exchanged LP8550 and R9731 & R9715 to be sure but still the same measurements. Can this be a SMC problem if PPBUS_G3H is stuck at 12.22V even if everything else works?"
