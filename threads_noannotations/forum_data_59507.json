        "message":"Hey guys!\n\nHoping I can get some tips on where I'm going wrong with this one!\n\nI have a Macbook 820-3476 here that has been dropped and has no backlight!\n\nI'm stuck in general.\n\nPP5V_S0_BKLT_D = 5V \nLCDBKLT_EN_L = 12.6V\nVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_R = 12.6V\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is at 0V which I know means there is a break in the circuit, however I'm unsure of where to start with this.\n\nI've follow the circuit and have 12.6v all the way until I get to Q7700 where I only have 12.6V on pins 4 & 3\n\nI know it's a P type mosfet but I'm lost to why it's not working. \n\nCan someone help me with my understanding of this, and fill the knowledge gap. \n\nThanks, Max"
