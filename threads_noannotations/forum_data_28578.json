        "message":"I've got an issue with this logic board and the lack of a boardview makes it harder to diagnose. The ISL chip (U7100) gets warm I've got good readings at both PP3V42_G3H and PPBUS_G3H. Some concerns I have is I have no readings for SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC and my reading for SMC_BC_ACOK for both pin 1\/2 is showing around 1.8V. Also my ADAPTER_SENSE voltage is showing at 0.7V. My U700 only gives voltage at adapter_sense and U7001 at pin 1\/2 and pin 5 (PP3V42_G3H).\n\nI've looked at every possible components linked to these for shorts but to no avail. I was hoping if someone can shine some light to my situation or give me some general guidance in how to diagnose macbooks.\n\nAlso I am using the 85W charger for this board so my readings should be accurate.\n\nThank you,\nSam"
