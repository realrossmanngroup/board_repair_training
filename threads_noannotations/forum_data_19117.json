        "message":"Hello,\n\nI am not getting battery detection on this logic board. Tested with a known good battery.\n\nChecked resistance on R5280 and R5281. No corrosion around the SMC that I can tell. PP3V42_G3H is present.\n\nSMBUS_BATT_SCL (SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL) was shorted to ground, the SDA line was OK. \n\nI replaced the ISL6258 U7000 and the short is gone, and diode mode measurements put it in line with another board that I had.\n\nAny thoughts? Bad SMC?\n\nThanks,\n\nStefan"

Schematic threw me off!\n\nDouble checked with a new ISL625[B]9[\/B] chip, battery detection still f***ed.\n\nIs it worth buying the kit to reball an SMC and replace this one, when I have maybe had 2 so far that would need this?\n\nThanks"
