        "message":"Working on an A2159 (820-01598) that came in with physical damage to the LCD assembly near the hinge\/screen bevel (see attached).\nThe board itself appears pristine with no signs of corrosion or liquid damage.  \nTested with known good LCD assembly and the backlight is still out. \n\nMeasurements so far (bare board):\n\nPP5V_SOSW_LCD --- 5V\nF8400 --- 12v, 0\u03a9\nPP3V3_S0SW_LCD --- 3.3V\nD8410 pin 1 --- 5V\nD8410 pin 2 --- ~33mV\nEPD lines from J8500 all appear to be good, no shorts to ground. \n\nIt seems the backlight circuit for these is significantly more complex than for previous models.
