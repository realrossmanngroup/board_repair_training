        "message":"So I was doing what I thought was a routine repair I have done at least 100 times, replacing the backlight driver on an 820-00165. I measured the voltage and was getting 8.1V so I assumed no boosting so I went ahead and replaced the driver IC. well now not only do I get 0V, I get no image, no USB activity. I decided to remove the chip I soldered on and still not working. Double checked that I was using LP8550TLE and that pin 1 was correctly oriented, which it was. I am at a loss here."
