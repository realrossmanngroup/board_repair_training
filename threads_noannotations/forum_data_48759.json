        "message":"Hope someone can help with this one as it's proving to be a complete pain. \nHistory: Macbook brought in with liquid damage and no power. Inspection revealed liquid damage around Q7130 which had also burned Q7130 and the CHGR_PHASE pad underneath. Smaller amount of liquid damage around U7100. \n\nWhat I have done so far:\nRun a jumper wire for CHGR_PHASE between Q7130 and L7130\nChecked for any obvious shorts to ground on PP_BUS, CHGR_PHASE, CHGR_LGATE, CHGR_SGATE - found none\nReplaced U7100 and Q7130 - multiple times as a pair with new chips\nReplaced R7121 and R7122 and checked resistance between pins 27 and 28 of U7100 to confirm 20ohms\nReplaced R7151 and R7152 and checked resistance between pins 17 and 18 - found even after replacement it wasnt 3ohms so traced the fault back and found no continuity between R7152 and R7150\nRan a jumper wire between R7152 and R7150 and checked resistance between pins 17 and 18 - now reads 3ohms\nReplaced R7125 and C7125 as they didnt look nice - tested ok with the meter but replaced anyway\nFound R7185 is only reading 1.2kohm instead of 470k as per spec - replaced it and C7185 but it still reads 1.2kohm makes me suspect Q7180 has an issue but I am getting PP_DCIN_CHGR at 19v with my 85w charger. \n\nCurrently the board will:\nRun fine off a charged battery - which points me squarely at an issue with the charger input side of the circuit. \nIt will also run off a charger but I believe Q7130 to be partially burned now as it is allowing around 17V through it to make PPBUS 17v which obviously means the system won't charge the battery as the voltage is to high. \n\nJust for reference with a previous Q7130 and U7100 I was only getting 4V on PPBUS"
