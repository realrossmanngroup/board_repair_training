        "message":"Got a MacBook Pro 15\" 2010 yesterday, I was informed that the USB ports where dead.\nThere is no water damage as far as I can tell and the previous owner said he probably overloaded the USB ports with USB hubs.\n\nI have got both USB ports working again, both L4605 and L4610 where open and got replaced.\n\nMounted the MacBook back together to find that the SD Card slot was dead.\n\nI have done a physical inspection and everything seems fine.\n\nU3500 gets powered, I have 3.3V all the way.\n\nOn Q3500 i get 3,2V on Pin 2 and 0V on pin 5, I don't know what these are suppose to be.\n\nOn Y3500 i get 1,5V on each side\n\nWhat do I check for next?"
