        "message":"So I got two A1398 2015\" with 820-00138 boards from different customers, but with exactly same issue -  no backlight (image is present). One of them is untouched, the other one has been worked on, but the other technician couldn't find the solution for backlight and gave up - he replaced LVDS connector, probably tried another U7701 because it's missing, tried another screen (the original screen was working with another board).\n\nWhat I have done so far:\n\n- tried another known good display assembly (100% 2015 model)\n- tried another U7701\n- tried another Q7706\n- checked LVDS connectors on both boards - they look completely fine\n\nU7701 measurements:\n\npin 5 = 5,07V\npin 18 = 5,06V\npin 11 = 5,84V\npin 17 = 3,33V\npin 15 = 5,01V\npin16 = 5,00V\n\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT - 51,2V\n\nD7701 is not shorted\n\nF7700 has continuity\n\nQ7706 measurements\n\npins 1-6 - 12,58V\npin 3 - 8,78V\npin 4 - 12,58V\n\nI believe boards are fine, as they produce 51,2V output voltage which is present on LVDS connector but for some reason backlight is not turning on..."

        "message":"[USER=1057]@piernov[\/USER], I've seen this article, but it hasn't changed anything in my situation, or maybe I dont understand something? Actually my I2C_BKLT_SCL and I2C_BKLT_SDA are 5V, they have continuity from J8300 to U7701. I have already replaced connector just in case. I have tested 3 different displays (2015 model). According to article on LogiWiki there is no U7750 on the board, whis is source of I2C_BKLT_SCL and I2C_BKLT_SDA. So it means it's present on LCD side?"
