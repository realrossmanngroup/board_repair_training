        "message":"Hello,\nI am facing an issue with a mac book air 820-00165-a mother board.\nWhen i connect the board on power supply the current go to 100mA and immediatelyfall and stay at 30 mA.\nThe green and orange light is present on the charger but i don't have a fan spin.\nAs i have a green light G3H lines are presents.\nMore over i have all S5 power rails active on the board.\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.55V\nPP3V42_G3H = 3,41V\nPP5V_S5 = 4.97V\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.31V\nPP3V3_SUS = 3.31V\nbut i don't have S4,S3 and S0 voltages.\nI tested for shorts but everything seems good.\n\nWhen i measure S4,S3 and S0 power rails during the boot sequence (that means when current jump to 100 mA on the power supply), I can see a jump on each lines, that means the board try to enable voltages from S4 to S0 but turn off everything immediately except for S5 power rails\n\nCan someone help me please,\nthx,\nVincent\n\nPS: no sign of liquid damage on the board"
