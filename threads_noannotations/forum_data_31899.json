When powered on the fan spins, screen turns on and you can hear the chime. A few seconds after the chime you hear the chime again and before the chime can fully play, it chimes again and gets stuck in a loop like that.\n\nCPU gets warm, MagSafe LED acts as expected.\n\nDon't even know where to start looking for the issue here, I assume since it powers on and chimes all rails are present. Is that a correct assumption?"
