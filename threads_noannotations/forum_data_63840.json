I injected 1v to those rails and found that C7675 Q7660 was damaged.\nBy removing these components PPBUS_G3H has a reading in diode mode of 0.456v but PP5V_G3S is still under 0.042v (diode mode) and I inject 1v and I don't get significant consumption.\nI removed U7650 just in case but I have the same problem"
