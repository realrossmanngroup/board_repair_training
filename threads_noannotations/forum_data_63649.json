        "message":"Hello\n\ni got A1708, customer said while opening the lid, sometimes it works sometimes not. I tried and most of the time it's black with no apple logo after chemie.... but sometimes it starts, I see apple logo, I see login prompt then it stops.. black screen but Mac still on.\n\nI install motherboard to another A1708, it's working fine.\n\nWhen I connect external display it works.\n\nThe screen looks nice, there's no scratches... customer said Macbook didn't fall.\n\nCould this be related to the little board between screen an motherboard ?"
