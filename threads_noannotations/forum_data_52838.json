        "message":"I have a 820-2915-B board that gets in S0 state, but no image, chime, backlight and CPU activity (checked with USB stick with LED). Fans do spin (first 3 seconds on, then 3 seconds off, then stays on). Heat sink gets warm (not hot). No visible damage on the board.\nS0 rails like PP5V_S0 and PP3V3_S0 are good.\n\nSince the CPU doesn't seem to do anything I focused on that:\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU = 0.77V (should be 1.25V ?)\nPPVCORE_S0_AXG = 0.98V\nPP1V5_S3_CPU_VCCDQ = 1.5V\nPP1V05_S0_CPU_VCCPQE = 1.05V\n\nSchematic says PPVCORE_S0_CPU should be 1.25V, but I kind of doubt if that is right.\n\nMeasured some power-good signals:\nPM_PCH_PWRGD = 3.46V\nCPU_PWRGD = 1.04V\nPM_MEM_PWRGD = 1.5V\nALL_SYS_PWRGD = 3.33V\n\nAll seem fine to me. Not sure what to check next. Kinda looks like a dead CPU to me."
