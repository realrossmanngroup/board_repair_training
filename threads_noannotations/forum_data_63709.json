        "message":"Hello. Got this one here, which I'm thinking may have a NAND problem. It does not turn on, don't negotiate 20V with charger, BUT, after taking some measurements and inspecting the board a little under the microscope I found that PP2V5_AWAKE_NAND is around 3.5V oscillating and UN100 gets a little warm. Charger stays at 5V and takes 0.42A from charger. Some caps around UN100 were bad and I replaced them, but still same symptom. If I take RN430 the board power cycles, going to 20V, trying to turn on and shuts off, cycling. I'm suspecting bad UN100, but who knows..."
