        "message":"Hello. Got this board here initially with no power at all. PPBUS_G3H was stuck on 1.6V. After inspection I found corrosion around C2952 area. Cleaned everything and replaced all caps that looked bad and also U8000 that was shorted to GND. Now board gets steady 8.56V on PPBUS_G3H and tries to enter S0. All S0 coils pulse including L7310\/20 but after that it goes to 0V again and nothing else. Already inspected whole board for other corrosion points but could not find anything. Where should I look now?"
