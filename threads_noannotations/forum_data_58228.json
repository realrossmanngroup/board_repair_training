        "message":"Hello all,\nThis is my first post! Don't hesitate to tell me where I can improve.\nSo, I have a board A1286 mid 2012, 820-3330, with no video\n- Green light on charger OK, I=1.85A with U=18.5V\n- Fan spins OK\n- Chime OK\n- Backlight OK\n- Grey screen also on external screen, but no image\n- Mouse in USB: red light for 30 seconds, then off\n\nMeasuring - I put () for the theoretical values on the schematic:\nPP3V42_G3H (3.42V): 3.41\nPPBUS_G3H (12.8V): 12.6\n\nLCD:\nPP3V3_SW_LCD (3.3V): 3.3\nPP3V3_S0_DDC_LCD (3.3V): 3.35\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT - PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT (50V): 30.2 (here I don't know why I have 30V instead of 40V or 50V as indicated on the schematics)\n\nGPU rails:\nPM_ALL_GPU_PGOOD (3.3V): 3.34\nPPVCORE_S0_GFX_REG \/ PPVCORE_GPU (1.0V): 0.91\nPP1V5R1V35_GPU_REG (1.5V): 1.36\nPP1V05_S0GPU_REG (1.05V): 1.06\n\nPP3V3_S0GPU_FET (3.3V): 3.34\nPP1V8_GPU_FET (1.8V): 1.84\n\nChipset rails:\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU_REG (1.25V): 0.92\nPPVCORE_S0_AXG_REG (1.05V): 0.93\nPP1V5_S3_CPU_VCCDQ (1.5V): 1.5\nPP1V05_S0_CPU_VCCPQE (1.05V): 1.06\nPPVCCSA_S0_REG (0.9V): 0.81\n\nAll was ok here, so I tried around U9600:\nPP3V3_S0_GMU_R: 3.33\nPP1V2_S0: 1.2\nALL_SYS_PWRGD: 3.33\nGMUX_S3_PD_EN:0\nGMUX_S3_PD_GND:3.34\nLCD_PWR_EN:3.33\n\nSo basically it seems that all powers are ok (except maybe for the backlight?), and I don't understand why I have no image. This can be GPU dead?"

It never disappears, stays always with the same intensity, pressed or not.\nIf I press caps lock (or ESC, or space bar) several times just after the mouse switches off (the 30s), red light appears for 3-4 seconds, then no reactions. If I wait 5 seconds after switch off, no way to have a red light again.\nNo history on this laptop, it comes from Ebay, but I don't see any water damage"

Thanks for the idea!!!\nNow I have 2 good boards and one chip :D\nAbout cleaning ME region: no idea about that, is it mandatory in case of new BIOS chip?
