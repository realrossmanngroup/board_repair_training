The PP3V3_S0SW_LCD will flash 3.3v only for a moment 1\/2 sec and then it goes away.\nI have traced this back to the EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN signal which also only flashes on for a split second.  \n\nComparing against my test board this should stay on even with a panel not connected for some time.\nI diode checked the data lines to the CPU and did not find any damaged lines.\n\nI am really lost here.\n\nBoard enters S0 state.
