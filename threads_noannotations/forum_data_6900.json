        "message":"Hello,\n\nI'm fixing this motherboard. When connected to power supply only or battery only, power led lights on and fans spin for half a second every 5\/6 seconds, corresponding to a general voltage drop to 0V on the logic board.\nI started to follow tracks ftrom DCIN but I feel this may take ages... Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated\n\nThanks"
