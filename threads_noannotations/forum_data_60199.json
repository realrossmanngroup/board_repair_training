        "message":"On the table I have an 820-00840 from a 2017 13\" MBP. There was definitely some sort of spill in the back.no liquid on the LCD connector, just some sticky stuff on the  heat pipe for the CPU by the fan, and on the edge of the board by U2800. One USB port is showing 5v @ 5mA and the other shows 5V but the board restarts after 2 seconds in a loop. If I use the other port the board stays on steady at 5V. I checked PP3V3_G3H and it is there. PPBUS_G3H is 0V but no shorts found. Is this one trash?"
