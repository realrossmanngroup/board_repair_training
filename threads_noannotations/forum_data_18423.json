        "message":"Hi to everyone! \n\nI have a problem with water damaged 820-00165-a board. The Keyboard and the trackpad stop to work as soon as it boots into OS but it is working in OS installation menu and i already installed a clean OS.  Some corrosion destroy the pin 5 of U5601, and posible also destroy something else in that sector. \n\nI took some measurements on  U5601 and is showing\nPin N\u00b01 is 0,167v\nN\u00b02 GrD.\nN\u00b03 0,168v\nN\u00b04 0,004v and\nN\u00b05 0,022v \n\nAlso C5603 is showing 3,32v.\n\nI took a picture please check it.\n\nPlease advise how to proceed.\n\nThanks."
