        "message":"Hi. I have A1398 model with 820-3662-a board that shows \"X\" on battery indicator. Initialy the machine stopped powering on after the owner took it apart to fix the hinges. Then he took it to a technician who managed to make it power on but only with the charger pluged in. After that I got it. The battery is marked with an X and if I take off the charger the machine goes to [URL=\"http:\/\/wikipedia.org\"]sleep[\/URL].\nPP3v42 is present\nSMBUS lines look ok\nI get 11.5 V on CHGR_BGATE witch is pin 4 of Q7155 and I guess that does not alow it to open.\n[URL=\"https:\/\/mailin.repair\/catalogsearch\/result\/?q=isl\"]ISL[\/URL] and Q7155 chip have been changed, but I still get 11.5v on CHGR_BGATE.\nI am not verry experienced with this but I am trying pretty hard so some help would much apreciated.\nThan you."
