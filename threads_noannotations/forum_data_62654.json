        "message":"Hello.\n\nI have this A1707 board that a few shops played around with. They were heating different controllers hoping it will power on. The main issue was a hole in the board on Q7065 Pin 5 side. I dug up and solved that, no more short on PPBUS_G3H. Also, I noticed that ''maybe'' on purpose they moved the Bios chip and no.1 to 4 pin were not in place and not making a contact. Also, they removed C4202 and when just shorted it with solder  o_O  I got to a point where I'm getting 20V on the meter and all LDO lines on CD have proper voltages.\n\n Any suggestions would be appreciated"
