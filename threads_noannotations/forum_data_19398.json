        "message":"I've got this 820-3330 board and only one of the usb ports work properly. USB A is not working, it does power on the light on my external drive but that is about it. i guess this port is also a SMC DEBUG port. i get 3.3v on pin 2 of L4600 which makes me think it might be in DEBUG mode, but not to sure. i get nothing on pin 1-2 of u4650. not sure where to go next on this. i watch a video from louis but it was a diff issue. found a few people have had this issue, but no solutions yet.\n\nany help would be awesome."
