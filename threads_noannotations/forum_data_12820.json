        "message":"Corrosion all over the place (see images).\n\n[B]Symptoms[\/B]\nI get a green light on the charger, machine switches on and fan starts spinning. After about 10 seconds, the fan speeds up to max RPM (heatsinks are in place)\nIf I have a stick of ram in the top slot, I get the gong to play, but no display (internal or external)\nIf I put a stick in the bottom ram slot, I get 3 beeps.\n\nI checked the LVDS connector and, with the machine running, got no voltage on all the below pins:\n\nPP3V3_LCDVDD_SW_F\nPP3V3_S0_LCD_F\nLVDS_DDC_CLK\nLVDS_DDC_DATA\nPPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT\nPPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT\n\nI looked at U9000 and noticed LCD_IG_PWR_EN is missing also.\nResistance from LCD_IG_PWR_EN to ground is 88 kOhms\nLCD_IG_PWR_EN comes from U1800, not sure how to proceed from here."

Tested it with a functional screen and cable, screen works!\nThe LVDS cable in the water damaged mac actually looked clean, so I decided to risk it and try it in the case it came out of, and it works too.\nRam slots are working fine too, turns out it was a bad ram stick which worked 'sometimes'.\n\nThis is only my third logic board repair (I've only done 'windows' laptops before) so I'm stoked!\nThanks, Duke!"
