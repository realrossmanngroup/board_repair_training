        "message":"Well, got this water damaged MacBook Air earlier this week. When I got it It wasn't charging or starting. The connector on the motherboard to the IO board was destroyed, so I replaced connector, flat cable and MagSafe\/IO board. The computer started and has worked fine for four days. Today the backlight started flickering and sometimes it goes black. A reboot sometimes brings back backlight, but with flicker. The flicker is the same even if I turn up or down brightness. Anyone seen this before?"
