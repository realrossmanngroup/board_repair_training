        "message":"820-4924 that had no power and no light on the MagSafe.\nReplaced Q7180 and U7100. Magsafe LED now works but PPBUS_G3H is only 1V.\nSame after Q7130 was replaced.\n\nPower draw on PSU is 0.017 amps.\nHistory unknown, no liquid damage spotted.\n\nThe schematic I have is password protected so can't copy\/paste\/search which makes tracking this hard. I am looking around page 54 (PBus Supply & Battery Charger) but am going in circles.\n\nAny advice appreciated."
