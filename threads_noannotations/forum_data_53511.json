If I add anything to my computer it breaks and I have to message in and get a new key.  So far I have been through this about 4 times and now they are not responding to my requests for assistance.  So I am dead in the water!  DO NOT BUY THEIR CRAP!\n\nWell I added a bluetooth keyboard and after restarting pc it broke!  So now I can't change a serial number.  I have ordered a Medusa programmer and accessories but it is not here yet.  I have a machine on my bench I have to change the serial number to that has to go out today.\n\nHow do you change serial numbers by hand?"
