I'll post this in case anyone else has a board like this.\n\nSomeone had removed C7583 and torn the pad connecting to PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS...\nThe connecting via comes from that pad through the very thin trace \/ pad of C7583. no idea if this is common but it may help someone if board has been fucked by customer."
