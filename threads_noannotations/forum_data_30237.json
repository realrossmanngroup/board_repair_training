        "message":"Hi Guys, I have a 2012 A1278 (820-3115) That had Very slight Water Damage around the Q5480 and R5481 Area. After Cleaning the area It still Had No Green Light so I Replaced U7000 and Now it Runs Perfectly Off the Charger But does not recognize Battery and there is no orange Light...I checked the Board For any Corrosion under the Microscope and all looks good...I am also Getting 12.23v at F7040 wIth adapter Present and 11.98v With just the Battery...3.4V on both Pin1 and 2 of L6995...I also removed C6400 and C6405...I am Getting 0.4v resistance between Pins 17\/18 on U7000...So far I have Replaced...U7000, Q7035, R6990, D6990, U6990, And R5087...Any ideas?...Thank You"

        "message":"Pin 17-18 0.04 ohms between them, it looks like your pins are shorting together, make sure U7000 is properly soldered and check again resistance between pins 17-18. It should be close to 2.2-4.5ohms.\n\nIf U7000 doesn't run well it will not output SMC_BC_ACOK (CHGR_ACOK) and this will prevent light on magsafe even if you have 3.42V on L6995.\n\n12,23V instead of 12,60V with charger is an indication that smc is not running because it's bad or because U7000 is not sending required signals to smc.\n\nU7000 is talking with smc, if data lines are messed it will not recognize battery. (See page 48)\n\nCould be also crap Under SMC but I would first adress U7000 for magsafe light and correct reading on pins 17-18."

I Also removed the Rubber Around the Corners of the SMC Chip Cleaned all around the perimeter the Fluxed and heated the SMC...I measured SMBUS_BATT_CSL and SDA lines and get 2.39 in Diode Mode...R5281\/80 giving Proper Mesurements also. Also I did replace R5087 Prior to getting a Green Light with a resistor that is 470k 5% 1\/16w 220 instead of a 1\/20w as that was all I had...Could that make a Difference on not seeing the Battery? And last but not least I have Not put C6409 and C6405 Back on the Board yet JUST IN CASE they were the reason for not getting a green light in the beginning...The computer Runs Great off the Charger But still no Battery...I feel like I'm SO CLOSE!!!..lol...Anything else I can try?. Thank You in advance for Your Help. :)"
