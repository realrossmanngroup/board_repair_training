        "message":"So whenever you plug-in a USB cord and it won't charge with new port & battery is U2 IC (iPads & iPhones).\n\nSo my question is: Why do I have a cable made by Belkin that will charge all devices with a damaged U2 IC? I've used several Belkin USB chargers, Apple chargers, etc. Nothing will charge a damaged U2 IC except this one cable.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nWhat is it about this particular cable that can bypass the U2 not working?"
