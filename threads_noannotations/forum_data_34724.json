        "message":"I'm getting killed by this board. It has 1.4V on PPBUS and will work on battery. It had a bad trace on pin 20 of U7000. Other than that nothing looked damaged and the board is very clean. It has Magsafe light, 3V42, ACOK. I replaced U7000 twice. No change either time. I replaced all 4 sense resistors and R7020 and R7050. All traces are good in those circuits. All components around U7000 are good. All pins on U7000 are measuring normal voltage-drop to ground. If I plug in a battery and then plug in the adapter it will stay turn on. But without the battery, it stays at 1.4V. This isn't adding up for me. Any idea what I'm missing?"

Pin 2 is 16.3V. 17\/18 is normal at around 2.5\u03a9 and 27\/28 is at 20\u03a9. They measured that before I changed the resistors, but I changed them just to make sure there wasn't something weird happening. No change after that."
