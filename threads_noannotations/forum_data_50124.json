        "message":"This board came in with no light on charger. Liquid at U7090, which I replaced and 3.4v came back. PPBUS = 8.6. More liquid at R7180, replaced and C7400 and C7425, resoldered U7400 as pin 12 had a tiny bit of corrosion on it.\n\nThe boards now gets green and orange light, I have 3.3v and a 5.1v pulse at C7518. PPVRTC = 3.3v. On U6100 I got 3.3v and area looks clean. U1950 has 3.4v and all_sys_pwrgd pulses at 3.3v but goes to 0. CPU Vcore also pulses. I cannot find any shorts. I did replace U7501 but situation is the same. U1900 has 32mhz clock. Ideas?"
