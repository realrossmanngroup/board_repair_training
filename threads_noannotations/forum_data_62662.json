        "message":"Hi, very first post on this nice forum. Read a lot here, but I've never seen something equal to my mystery. Hopefully it has a solution...\n\nSo, after connecting charger, Apple logo after a while, no progress line. After 5 secs reboot and so on.\nSwitching to VERBOSE mode gives more info (see picture), but always ends up with EB|LOG:EXITBS:START. Reboots and always the same.\nMacbook reboots when PM_SYSRST_L becomes low for a second.\n\nTrying to enter recovery gives backlight, but no more text, nor Apple logo\nConnect USB with OS, press option and switch on, gives USB activity, but again only backlight, nothing else. Just like with recovery, the whole thing reboots after a while.\nMeasured every tension, everything is present.\nPPVCC_S0_CPU is 0,6V when Apple logo is displayed, just after reboot it's 1,1V. \n\nMaybe some useful history of this board...\n\nThe owner dropped the Macbook from a table. After that, nothing, but CPU became very hot. When this thing became very hot, blowers goes blowing. After some \"jumping\", board w\/h battery pulled 666mA steady.\nReballed CPU, same behavior.\nReflowed SMC which gave backlight at the first try, but while booting Suddenly just 20mA steady on my USB-C meter. C1061 on PP1V2_S3_CPUDDR became shorted (coincidence?). Replaced and I've got backlight again and the Apple logo which always reboots.\n\nSMC bypass mode doesn't work I think (blowers don't start to blow at full speed).\nWhen I disconnect touchpad, reboots are faster. Such fast that I've nothing more on the screen. In that case gives an SMC reset (reset pins on the board) an Apple logo once, until the first reboot.\n\nAt last attempt, I've reballed SMC, the same behavior.\n\nSpent already days on this...\n\nThanks for the info!\nGert\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60616[\/ATTACH]"

Board tries to boot, I've got backlight, but nothing on the screen.

With touchpad disconnected, I have faster reboots and nothing on the (laptop) screen. Only when resetting SMC I have one time an Apple logo for a few secs. Touchpad communicates to SMC via SMBUS_SMC_3_SDA, right?\n2. SMC bypass doesn't do anything. I expect blowers at full speed.\n3. In a few Hackintosh forums, people who had this error had a faulty virtualSMC.\n4. Sometimes, but really sometimes, I already forget, but had it again when trying with the bios file, the left blower blows at full speed and the right one doesn't doe anything. \n\nThe last thing I can remember myself: when giving the PRAM reset command, I've only the backlights with the reboots, no more Apple logo. \nIt seems he can't find his startup disk before the reboot happens.\nLucky me in the very first beginning, I've stored a copy of his original Bios. Reprogram this in the EFI chip gives again the Apple logo."
