        "message":"Hello guys,\n\ni just got a 820-3332 15 inch retina MBP with no video. The Macbook suddenly went black while editing video. \nWhen you turn on the Mac you hear the chime but the screen stays black.\nCan somebody give me a hint whats the problem in most cases at this model?\n\nAlso I have kind of a very very stupid problem, I try to figure out what caused the problem but I got stuck at the beginning.\nI removed the logic board to check it and now the problem is that it won't turn on! It is the first time I work on a 15 inch retina MBP, is there a thing to do in a other way than on a 13 inch model. Why does the logic board does not have a fan spin when I attach power through the Magsafe connector and with an attached SSD to the board? \nI attached a image of my test setup!\n\nThanks a lot guys!"
