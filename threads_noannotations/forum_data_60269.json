Because A1237 turns on alone when connecting the power supply, I thought A1304 would be the same... they are \"almost\" identical.\nAnyway, now fan spins, it chimes, LCD backlight on, but no blinking folder, either on internal or external displays.\nThere is USB activity, at the beginning steady LED switched on then blinking after 45 seconds.\n\nPP3V3_LCDVDD_SW_F=1.1V\nPP3V3_S0_LCD_F=3.4V\nPP3V3_S5=3.4V\nPP3V3_LCDVDD_SW=3.4V so I assume L9004 is not good, it does not look nice, I will change that tomorrow and tell you the result"

All these names were not clear for me, I found an interesting link to understand them:\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Northbridge_(computing)[\/URL]\nBut ok, NVIDIA needs power button.\n\nReplacing L9004 solved the issue, now blinking folder.\n\nI read a comment from Louis in the link below that  macbook air (a1237\/a1304) should be avoided. Can you tell me their weak points?
