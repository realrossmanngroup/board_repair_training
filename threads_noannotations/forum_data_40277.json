        "message":"So got an interesting one not sure where to look. I've fixed a few touchbars, but this one came is super clean for no power. Basically the problem is this device has 5 volts on DC in but it bootloops on one side of the board. When you plug in a USB connector to JB500 (left side port) you get 5 volts on DC in with about a 0.04 amp draw. When you plug in a connector to J3300 you get 5 volt bootloop 5 volt bootloop over and over again. Like I said, no evidence of liquid anywhere on the board. I reflowed both U3100 and U3200 just on the off chance they had a broken ball under them, but no change. Where do I look from here? DC in and PP3v3_G3H are both not shorted to ground."

Make sure your charge IC's are good when you pull them (tough to do)\n2. These devices CAN turn on with one charge IC not working properly (has to be a good IC if it was improperly soldered) \n3. Improper soldering will allow the device to kick on but the port for the one that is not soldered properly will NOT allow the port to work.\n4. Bootlooping is not necessarily on the port side of the bootlooping. In this case, a charge IC on the non bootlooping side was causing bootlooping on the other side.\n\nThank you for all the help 2informaticos!"
