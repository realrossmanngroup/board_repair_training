        "message":"820-00281 Not charging, 5V 0.02A on charger only (battery unplugged), 20V 0A with battery plugged, shows sign of battery flat.\nShould be a simple problem to fix but...\n\nEach USB-C port shows 5V with 0.02-3A consumption. No port power cycles.\nWhen checking rails around the USB-C chip, I'm getting my 1.1V, 1.8V, 3.3V and 5V as expected.\nPPBus does not have a short, .4V drop in diode mode.\nI am getting 0.04V on PPBUS, floating.\n\nI went ahead and replaced the SMC from a donor thinking there might be communication issue on those BI lines. No cigar.\nI also went ahead and replaced the ISL. No cigar.\nHowever I got that ISL 9239C0 from Aliexpress (original being 9239HI) but read that the 9239C0 should work just fine.\n\nThough, noob question here...\nShall I be getting 20V before getting PPBus?\n\nI assume yes and that's why I believe I went on the wrong road chasing no PPBus when I should be chasing why I am not getting 20V first.\nAny good read on the Wiki or idea where to look at please?\n\nAlso I assume a short on some rail down the road is not on the list since I am getting the battery sign showing up with the battery plugged in."
