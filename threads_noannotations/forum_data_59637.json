        "message":"Im working on a spillage board . There was spillage around the battery area and also around U4801.I changed this Ic. Now it turns on when adapter inserted and powers up. if you power it off it powers up again. If you remove the adapter it will stay on with the battery but will not charge. It will turn off using powerbutton but wont power on again.\n\nF7140  = 11.8v\nJ0505 = pins 13\/14 = 3.3v\nR7050 = 10k\n\nI have reballed and replaced the smc but still the same.\nI have replaced U7100.\nAny input appreciated"
