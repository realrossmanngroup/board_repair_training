        "message":"Hi, ive got an 820-00687 with no power and ppvrtc_g3h missing 0v , now this line looks like its a dead short to ground but i have noticed (maybe im wrong) that ppvrtc_g3h is connected to the cpu, so would it be safe to inject a little voltage to see what warms up ???, also im using schematics and boardview for the 00244 so i hope thats right. All my other voltages seem correct \nPPBUS_G3H = 19.8v\nPPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H = 19.8v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS = 8.6V\nPPVBUS_LIO = 19.8v\nPPDCIN_G3H =19.8v\nPP3V3_G3H=3.3v\nPP3V3R3V0_AON = 3.2v\nPP5V_G3H = 5v"
