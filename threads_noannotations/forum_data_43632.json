        "message":"Hi everyone, \n\nI have an 820-00165, the board looks new and has a green light but no power. \n\nnoticed that F7140 has 8.6v on pin 1 but 0v on Pin 2, I can also see that there is short to ground on pin 2. \n\nI just bought myself a power supply and connected black wire to the screw hole and red to pin 2 (f7140 removed), on the power supply itself I  can only increase the amps, set the amps to 5 and voltage went to 0.85v. What am i doing wrong here?"

        "message":"It's pulling power because something is shorted it's working fine. Inspect all of the tantalum caps for cracks and or ooze coming out of them it is very common for the ones above the fan FPC to crack or go bad as well as ones in the center of the board. For future reference, it is always best to start at 1 volt in case the CPU is shorted. Something must absolutely be getting hot tho at 5 amps."
