        "message":"recently i noticed that when i replace a hdd in a a1278 for ex. the osx installer wont see the new hdd (same if im using usb installer or internet recovery) but if i format it to whatever, like ntfs, than it will see that, and i can format it , than install osx.\nAlso, today there was a 11 incher Air, with - probably -  updated 512gb SSD, and it was booting fine, but wanted to reinstall it anyway, and 10.11 or 10.13 usb installer did not see the SSD, than i booted with a portable windows in an ext. usb enclosure, that saw it, formatted to ntfs, than osx installer saw it and formatted it properly. What is going with that?"
