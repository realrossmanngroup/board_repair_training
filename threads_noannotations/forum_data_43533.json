        "message":"I have a Macbook Pro 13\" Retina 2015 (A1502) with a 820-4924-A board. It got water damage and I got if for free from work to play around with.\nI've watched many of Louises videos and I'm very interested to learn board repair as a hobby.\n\nI get a green light (turns orange after a couple seconds) when connecting power. If I put my multimeter to VDC and measure PPBUS_G3H on F7140 it fluctuate from 3.2V to 11-12V with 5 seconds-isch between the highs and lows.\n\nIf I put it in diode mode (with no power to the board) and put the red probe on ground and black on F7140 I get 132 on the multimeter on both sides of the fuse.\nI measured the same on F7700 and got 127 on both sides. I don't know if this is to any help since I don't have a know good value for this.\n\nWhat can make it fluctuate like that? I've never heard Louise mention anything like that in the videos I've watched.\nOr is it my multimeter? It's a cheap ass multimeter for like $15 that I borrowed from my step dad."

[\/QUOTE]\n\nIs the ISL the U7100 or U7200?\nIf I look in the schematics I only find these two with the name ISL that have up to 28 pins.\nAnd by 17\/18 and 27\/28 do you mean resistance between 17 and 18 or 17 and 27?\n\nMy probes on my multimeter are two thick so can't seem to get an accurate reading. I tried to file them down but the only \"accurate\" reading I could get was from 17-27 on U7200 and it was somewhere around 10.6 Kohm\n\nI'm gonna get some new probes tomorrow that will let me test this properly.\n\nI've attached two pictures where the corrosion was. There might have been small drops outside the marked area.\n\n[QUOTE=\"2informaticos, post: 43557\"]$10 should be good too.\nIs not multimeter problem; you have a problem on the board.\nCheck if voltage on big coils fluctuate too.\n\nAlso try to start in SMC bypass mode.[\/QUOTE]\n\nBy big coils do you mean the inductors?\nI'm kind of new to this so sorry if I ask dumb questions.\n\nI measured the voltage on L7130 and it fluctuate the same between 3.2-11V\nL7520: 0-5V\nL1295: 0-1V\n\nI can't seem to find out how to start in SMC bypass though but I have done a SMC reset and that didn't do anything.\n\nI just noticed that if I have the battery connected at the same time as the powe cable it stops fluctuating and PPBUS_G3H is 10.6V\nI only tried this when putting it back in the chassi to try restting the SMC.\n\nDoes this narrow it down?"
