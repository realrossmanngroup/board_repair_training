        "message":"Hi all,\nTHis is a liquid dmg board only near Q7030 ,Q7035, C7036,C7035,C7037.  I replaced all these and still get 3.77v on R7021 & R7022 current sensing resistors. \n\nResistance between R7021 & 21 is 21ohms and R7051\/R7052 is 2.9ohms.\n\nI replaced U 7000 still the same.\n\nq7080 all pins have 16.5v.  Q7085 pin 1-4 I get 16.5v then the rest 3.7v\n\nR7086 CHGR_AGATE both side 16.5v.\n\nWell when the battery connected, I get  16V R7021\/ R7022 and  10v on PPBUS_G3H and fan goes high.\n\nthis is what I get with our battery connected on U7000.\n\nPIN 1 = 14.5V                PIN 8 = 3.3V\nPIN 2 = 13.9V                PIN 9 = 3.7V\nPIN 3 = 3.9V                 PIN 10 TO 18 = 3.3V\nPIN 4 =3.3V                  PIN 19  = 8.9V\nPIN 5 = 3.3V                PIN 20  =7.8V\nPIN 6=  3.3V               PIN 21  =0V PIN 22 0V\nPIN 7 = 3.3V              PIN 23\/24 = 3.3V , PIN 25 8.4V  PIN 26 =15.V , PIN 27\/28 3.7V\n\nAppriciate your help.\n\nThank you"
