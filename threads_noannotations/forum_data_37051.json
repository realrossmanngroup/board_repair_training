        "message":"Hi. I am new to Macbook logic repair and am trying to get a Macbook Air to power on. \n\nCharger goes from green to orange, no liquid damage. I thought older Macbooks had a green light if the battery wasn't plugged in. Anyway, here are some measurements I took, \n\nPPBUS_G3H @ C3080 8,57v\n\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS @ R7202 8.59v\n\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS @ C7500 8.59v\n\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL @ R7110 15.15v\n\nPPDCIN_G3H @ R7110 3.98v\n\nPP3V42_G3H @ C5006 3.42v\n\nPPVRTC_G3H @ C1910 3.32v\n\nPP5V_S5 @ C7505 5v\n\nPP5V_S4RS3 @ C4690 Goes to .9v then to 0v\n\nPP3V3_S5 @ C3550 3.3v\n\nSMC_RESET_L @ Pin 5 U5110 3.39v  \n  I am not sure where to go from here. I haven't tested a known DC board but have one coming in early next week. Any ideas?"
