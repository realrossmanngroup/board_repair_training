        "message":"I have a 820-00164 from another shop with no water damage, green light, but no power. PPBUS_G3H is at 1-2V so I imagine a short. Visual inspection and C7314 is destroyed. I replace it and still no power\/fan and PPBUS_G3H is now 4.5V. After measuring around forever, I finally measure BOTH pins of F7140, pin 2 is at 4.5 and pin 1 is 8.6. I measure for continuity and there is none! Has anyone ran into a partially blown fuse before?? I still consider myself a novice-- Louis, I think I have seen all of your videos, but I have never heard of this??"
