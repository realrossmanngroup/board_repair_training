        "message":"Hi.\nI have a problem with 820-00928-a   . This mac is not booting . Some times it says that something is wrong and needs to reboot and keep rebooting. Some times the apple logo appear  and remain stuck at spinning circle. If i enter in apple diag.  and do a ssd diag. it keep searching  the ssd but it see nothing. The motherboard is clean  and no corrosion present.   The beauties is that the ssd is soldered on motherboard. Can you give some idea  where to start?\nThx."
