        "message":"Hello ,\n\nI got this Macbook A1989  was previously water damaged and was repaired by me , last week the owner brought it saying that its not charging and not booting  , so I have checked it and on my AMP meter i am getting 5.09V      , 1.01 watts and 0.20 amps . So I proceeded to open it and take a quick look inside and all was looking fine .So I pulled out the board and connect my amp meter and placed the board under my thermal imager and found that U6903 was getting super hot , so I ordered U6903 on eBay since i did not have any donor boards here to harvest it from , I received the chip on Friday and I installed it Yesterday and the behavior did not change . Since after I changed U6903 with the new chip that I ordered U7800 and U3900 The T2 along with U6903 they get hot but still no 20V on my USB amp meter and no boot , I have checked all  the CD3215 Chips  and I have even changed the whole 4 of them which  I did not even have to but did it just in case , now I m wondering if my U6903 new chip can be bad as the seller would allow only one chip per order so i was able to get only one chip of U6903 . PPBUS_G3H is Present.\n\nPlease Help me out."
