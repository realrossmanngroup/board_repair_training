        "message":"Hey All,\n\nI did something very, very, very stupid! During LCD replacement (complete assembly) i was convinced i did but did not disconnect the battery. During reconnection of the new screen, there was a small flash and the machine turned on, i soon that realised that the battery still connected and quickly disconnected the battery. \n\nAfter reassembly i discovered that the webcam is not recognised, so i though f##k! I threw on the old screen and the outcome was the same.2 \n\nWhat is happening now, the machine is powering on and charging, the screen is powering on, in fact everything seems good apart from the webcam and the keyboard light.\nI have spoken with the owner, he is going to back up what is needed and than we can have a closer look.\n\nIf any has any ideas, would very much welcome any help!"

        "message":"First of all, welcome to the forum!\n\nLCD connector shouldn't have any power rail active, if machine is in off state.\nIf you've disconnected battery without removing charger first, that could generate more damage.\nSome boards also have a button to discharge PPBUS_G3H line on battery alone; depends the model.\n\nKeyboard light doesn't work because ALS (placed on camera module) is not working also.\nYou can have a simple problem with power rail for ALS\/CAM, or more complicated with data lines.\nPost the exact board model..."
