        "message":"Hi, I have this board which I dont know what else to do to it, I get all_sys_pwrgd but get no chime, and no image on it. When I connect it to the magsafe 2 (original magsafe 2 85watts, no adapter 1->2) I get a green light, and then it turns orange, no fan or chime...\nppbus_g3h = 12.60\npp3v42_g3h= 3.42\nall_sys_pwrgd= 3.3v\n\nIn adition to this, and because I got stuck diagnosing this board, can you please help me sending me a document or link to the  explanation of the power on sequence on the macbooks? I can fix back light, ISL issues and some others, but this is the 3rd month I am using the forum and I really dont think I have learned a lot from it, I really want this to work, but I need help to learn this stuff... thank you..."
