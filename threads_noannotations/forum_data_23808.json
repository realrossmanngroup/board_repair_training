        "message":"Hi there, I have an old MacBook Air that I'm using for practice (still very much a novice at this). Apparently it was water damaged, but I saw little evidence of that inside.\n\nI have most of the rails present, apart from PPVCORE_S0_CPU and PPVCORE_S0_MCP.\n\nLooking at U7400, PP5V_S0_CPU_IMVP is coming in on pin 21 okay, but nothing is coming out. I'm not sure if this is a fault with U7400, or if it's not being told to turn on. If I'm following the schematic correctly (and I may not be) IMVP_VR_ON should be coming from the SMC into pin 25, but I'm getting 0V at pin 25.\n\nI'm trying to figure out of this is an issue with U7400 or the SMC, or perhaps something else that is preventing the VCORE from being created.\n\nI know this is very vague, and I apologise for that. Any suggestions as to what I might check next?\n\nThanks in advance,\nBruce"

I don't think there's a short to ground, and the area around U7500 looks pretty tidy.\n\nI'm still waiting for my donor board to arrive, but when it does, do you think I should try replacing U7500?\n\nThanks again,\nBruce"
