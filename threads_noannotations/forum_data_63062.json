If the board is not powered on for a few minutes diode mode is .335  After power is applied and after checking about a minute later a short of 0.38 appears. \n\nRemoved all power filter caps and replaced u9080 but no change.\n\nAnything else worth trying or is it a bad nand?\n\nDFU mode fails with error 4025  \"give up waiting for device to transition\""
