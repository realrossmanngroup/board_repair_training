        "message":"Perhaps one of the infamous dead CPU issues, but I wanted to check if I can do anything before declaring it dead.\n\nNot much history other than \"just stopped working\", everything is extremely clean, resembling a brand-new laptop.\n\nIt is drawing 20.1V, 0.6A, with no fluctuations. On one single occasion, perhaps out of 20-30, it has drawn 1A+ and booted up fine. However I've seen also mentioned graphical glitches shortly after.\n\nThe power button works. When it fails to boot, cpu casing goes up to around 60-70C.\n\nAlso, the whole 1\/3 middle portion of the board reaches about 40-50C\n\nPPBUS_G3H 8.63V\nPPDCIN_G3H 20.15V\nPP3V3_G3H 3.31V\nPP3V3_S5 3.31V\nPP3V3_SUS 3.31V\nPP3V3_S4 3.30V\nPP3V3R3V0_AON 3.26V\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.31V\nPP5V_S4 5.01V\nPP5V_S0 5.01V"
