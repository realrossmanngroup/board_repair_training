NOT SURE WHAT I AM MISSING.\nany suggestions are welcomed. \n(did find a few resistors on PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT that do not measure in ohms correctly, but i replaced them (and measured before i did) and its almost like they measure incorrectly only when on this board.\nboard is water damaged, and yes ive confirmed its the backlight, and its not the lcd i tested it with a known working lcd ."
