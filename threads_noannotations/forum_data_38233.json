        "message":"00165 board with liquid damage\n\nMagSafe but no fan\n\nF7140 had 8.6v on pin 1 and 0.2v on pin2 but it wasn't blown\n\nStuck 5v onto pin 2 to see if anything warmed up. \n\nU7310 was getting warm so swapped that, then I noticed Q7310 on the other side was also getting warm. Swapped it and now PPBUS is stable but will Q7310 have f'd the CPU in the ass or is there a chance it survived the sodomy?\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.58v\nPP5V_S5 = 5.01v\nPP3v3_S5 = 3.31v\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0v\nSMC_PM_G2_EN = 3.43v\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3.31v\nPP3v3_SUS = 3.31v\nPM_DSW_PWRGD = 3.42v\n\nS4_PWR_EN = 0v\nPP15v_TBT = 0v\n\nQ3080\nPin 4 = 8.58v\nPin 1 = 8.12v\nPin 2-3 = 0v"
