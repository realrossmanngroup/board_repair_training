        "message":"Hi All,\n\nJust wondering if anyone is having much luck with 216-0732019 chips date codes 0937 & 0943 ?\n\nI have also tried 216-0732025 1512 date code. Just cant get a decent chip at the moment. I have 10 here I need to fix asap, with another possible 50 on their way.\n\nIm up shit creek,if there is no decent chips now available. \n\nI know its not shitty soldering, on my behalf. As I gave a few chips to others, and they have had the same result.\n\nAny alternatives anyone know of?\n\nG"
