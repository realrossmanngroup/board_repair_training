        "message":"52v means it's not making its way to the LCD. bad LCD cable, or bad connector on the LCD end. it is creating the voltage but since it doesn't \"see\" the load of the screen the voltage is higher than usual. Think about how old phone systems worked - when the phone was on the hook it'd be 48 or 50 volts, when it would be off the hook it would be 6 volts or something.. point being, when there is a \"load\" from a complete circuit you'll see a lower voltage. backlight on any of these systems should never exceed 35-39v. If it does, the screen light isn't plugged in or is totally fucked."
