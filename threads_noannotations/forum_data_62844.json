        "message":"Hi all, I have a 00928 board on my bench. It came in with 5v 0.21a, PPBUS was 0.5v. Found that C6913 was getting molten hot so replaced it and now the machine gets to 20v and comes on, but it only gets to a \"charge battery\" screen for a few seconds and then shuts off. This happens with both battery + charger as well as charger alone. What should I be checking next in this case? Replaced D6902 on a whim as well."
