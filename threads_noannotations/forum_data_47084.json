        "message":"Hi, This touchbar macbook originally had liquid damage only around the U3100 area. I had to run a couple wires on a resistor and capacitor due to the pads being gone on them. After that the machine turned on and everything worked fine. I sent it back to the customer and now they sent it back to me since it is showing a questionmark folder and now I don't feel the trackpad clicking and even if I hold the option key on startup nothing happens.\nThis isn't the first time I've fixed a machine that had liquid damage around a USB-C controller chip only to have it return back a few weeks later for a questionmark folder appearing but this one doesn't make sense to me because the only liquid damage was on the opposite side of where the SSD controller chip is.\n\nHere are some measurements around the TPAD area that I took to find out why it's not clicking.\nF4500 - 13v on both sides.\nL4500 - 5v on both sides\nPP3V3_S4_TPAD - 0.08v"

In voltage mode I was also getting 0v on PP5V_S4 but in diode mode PP5V_S4 is not shorted to ground.
