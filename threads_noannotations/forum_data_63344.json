        "message":"Having a right shit night of it tonight! \n\nHave this mac air, it was a trade in from a customer had a damaged screen, I replaced the screen cleaned it installed monterey and had it up for sale for weeks.  Got a call from someone today that wanted it, so took it from the shelf to give it a clean and get it ready. Won't fkin turn on! \n\nIt worked perfectly before I even used it for browsing the net for a couple of weeks. \n\nI get fan spin and both green and orange light on charger,  no bong no display, nothing on external display and I can't seem to get any USB activity. \nVoltages all look good so went over the usual suspects and find R7122 \/R7121 are bad, I've replaced these but still the same symptoms, I got fed up with it at one stage today and walked off leaving it with plugged in, came back 2 hours later and it was at a login screen! Yey I shout. Shut it down clean it, now same thing again it just won't boot, fan spin, lights on magsafe no display,\n\nAny ideas?"
