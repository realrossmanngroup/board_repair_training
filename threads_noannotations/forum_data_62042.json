        "message":"Board originally had corrosion damage and not powering up. After cleaning, replaced U1900, U7600, U1950, C5125. Also repaired trace between C1950(1) and U1950(8). It worked for about a week and now not powering up again. When i place heat using a soldering iron directly on U1950 for about a minute, i can then boot up the board. When allowed to cool, the board fan spins for about 5 seconds, shuts off and then starts spin. At this point, the usb port keeps repeating on and off (usb test led goes on and off). I've replaced U1950 multiple times, along with R1962, R1950, R1963 and C1950. Replaced the wire used to repair the trace between C1950(1) and U1950(8) previously as well, with the same result.\n\none other thing to note, when i try measuring the voltage on R1950(2), the board shuts off. R1950(1) is 3.3v and the board doesn't shutoff when i take measurement from that point \n\nAny suggestion"
