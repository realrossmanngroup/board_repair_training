        "message":"So got an A1708 in today doesn't appear to turn on,\n\nWhen the charger is connected it does go up to 20v and also appears to charge the battery - the trackpad clicks but nothing on the screen. No fan spin but the CPU does appear to be getting warm. Caps lock doesn't light up when pressed, PRAM reset doesn't work, SMC reset does work.\n\n\nFound a small amount of corrosion on U3780 so have removed, cleaned and replaced but the behaviour hasn't changed.  No other visible corrosion or liquid anywhere else on the board.\n\nBoard is drawing 20V and 2.8A when battery connected and 20V and 0.40a when battery disconnected."
