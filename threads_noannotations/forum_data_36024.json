        "message":"I recently got a liquid damaged board which I got to the state of turning on and working. However, when I hook up two separate batteries, both are saying \"not charging\" and \"replace now\". When I look at System Diagnostics it shows current draw is 0mA.\n\nThings I checked:\npin 17\/18 of U7100 = 2.5ohm\npin 27\/28 of U7100 = 20.2ohm\nCHGR_BGATE = 12.5V\n[B]PPVBAT_G3H_CONN = 2.269v . <- Does this seem ok?[\/B]\nPPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG = 12.59v\n\nQ7155\n[B]drain voltage: 2.269v . <- Why is it not 12v?[\/B]\nsource voltage 12.59v\ngate voltage: 12.5v\nResistance drain to ground is infinite.\n\nCould it be that both the batteries I tried are broken or is my Q7155 broken?\n\nThanks,\nRohit"
