        "message":"this was liquid damaged but on the motherboard i dont see any liquid, mostly the keyboard got it, i replaced that, works, the liquid was stopped by the black sheet under the board, so the board looks very clean\n\nit has 2 usb c ports, one of them looks burnt at one pin, the other is ok, \n\nso now when i plug the charger, it detects it and automatically turns on, it boots into osx and works fine, but every 2 seconds it chimes like when u plug in the charger, the usb-c measurement device just comes on then goes away, and battery is not charging, with disconnected  battery the device show 4.8V 1.6A and macbook wont turn on that way, but at least the display of the measure device is constantly on, but never goes to 20V\n\nnow i dont have another charging port for this, i hope maybe that is causing the issue, but is it possible that the u2800 usb chip is dying? is it possible to order that, or the only way is the get it from donor board and reball it? thats a huge job"

        "message":"the charger port itself became hot, easy to see  with isopropyl, simply replacing the charger port sorted it\n\nthough replacing the port is tricky, removing the shild with a large hot air is nice, with a 2kw heater at 70% power, parts dont fly away\n\nbut i wanted to clean the holes after removing the usb port with a solder suction device, and i sucked the small smd parts near the port, so i had to replace like 25 small smd part, now what i do is to use the wick to remove the solder, which is fairly easy after i added the new leaded solder to the holes on both sides"
