You are untouchable as a buyer. Maybe they'll think before selling a pile of shit again......\n\nWe had a customers machine in with same freezing issue and thought it was RAM.\nIt would start in safe mode fine.\n\nWhen we put the board on another screen the freezing went away. No idea why, EDID maybe?... Who knows but it started working.\nWe put the shit screen back on there and the freeze was back. After going back and forth with new and old screen we sent it out with a new screen and it never came back.\n\nAnyone know why or want to guess?"
