        "message":"Hello,\n\nI may have shorted something during the process of thermal paste replacement. No sign of magic smoke or apparent damaged component.\nThe Macbook doesn't want to turn on anymore (screen, keyboard and touch-bar stays black). I do have fans spin and track-pad feels clicky when powered on. A long press on the touchID button turn it off. I doubled-checked all the connections and everything seems to be plugged in the right place.\n\nI took some measures if it can help, based on one of the video I found here.\n\n[B]PPBUS_G3H -> 12.6V\nPP3v3_G3H -> 3.4V\nPP3V0_G3H -> 3V\nPP5V_S4 -> 5.1V\nP5VS4_EN_RCD -> 3.3V\nPM_SLP_S5_L -> 3.3V\n\nPP5V_S0 ->  5.1V\n[COLOR=#FF0000]PP5V_S0SW_LCD ->  0V[\/COLOR]\n\nPP3V3_S5 -> 3.3V\n[COLOR=#FF0000]PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_R -> 0V\nLCD_PWR_SLEW_3V3 -> 0V\nPP3V3_S0SW_LCD -> 0V[\/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#FF8C00]BKLT_SD -> 5.13V\nLCDBKLT_EN_L -> 11.3V   [\/COLOR][COLOR=#000000](Shouldn't d this be 12.6? )[\/COLOR][\/B]\n\nAny idea what could go wrong?\n\nIn advance thanks,\nJustin"

After reinstalling the OS (nothing running in the bg) and fans set to 100%, I measured idle temperatures at 90 degrees C. This was unacceptable...\nThis laptop was always kept dry, and no green\/blue signs on the board.\n\nI don't know if this could be a clue where to look at, but everything around U8500 and U8501 don't get the right voltage, see my first post. I get PP5V_S0 at 5V and PP3V3_S5 at 3.3V but nothing out."
