        "message":"Hello,\nthis 820-3032 had 3x beeping ram. I gave all 16 Ram ICs a reflow and now it wont turn on. PP5V_S0 is there on the fan connector but the fan won\u00b4t spin. That is confusing to me. PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT is 0V so the ram is not powered. I followed this path and came to PLT_RESET_L and ISOLATE_CPU_MEM_L. They are both not present - that is why the ram has no power - and should be created by the PCH (as far as i understand). Diode mode readings:\nISOLATE_CPU_MEM_L   : 0.5V\nPLT_RESET_L                 : 0.425V\nso they are not shortet.\nNow i have no idea what to check next."

Memory Voltagte is not shortet but VCORE is (thats why all the other signals are missing) and it had to be present bevore so i think the CPU died during the process... This was not my first time reflowing ram and i experience the same with this boards... Thank you both for the fast reply."
