I used to but it was not helpful so I canx it.  Not sure where to go for iPad issues.   Seems like a secret community."

We saw about 30+ at once for the same issue tried multiple different things (coils, diodes, filters, etc.) and nothing seemed to fix the issue."

        "message":"It a strange one. Power on without battery you get a apple logo. If you give it the battery before it figures out there is not one the back light stays on and works. You can even hit power on and off \"not hard boot\" and it comes on and off normally.\n\nBoot it with battery and it also boots but no back light. Only way to trick back light on is to boot no battery.\nCheck out this video and tell me if you fought the same thing.\n\n[URL]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tk7kiyPY95w&t=191s[\/URL]"
