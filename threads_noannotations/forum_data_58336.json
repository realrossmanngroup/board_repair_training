        "message":"Hello all,\n\nThis board works but it has no audio, not even the chime at start up. Prohibitory sign is displayed when trying to change the audio level.\nNo beep sound also if no memory installed.\n\nIn system preferences > sound: there is nothing for output or input.\n\nIf I plug a audio USB adapter, it appears in the above menu, and volume control works normally.\n\nSome measures:\n\nPP1V8_SO_AUDIO=1.8V\nPP4V5_AUDIO_ANALOG=4.5V\nPP5V_S3_AUDIO=5V\nPP3V3_S0_AUDIO=3.3V\nHDA_RST_L=3.3V\n\nbut\nAUD_GPIO_3=0V, so is SPKRAMP_SHDN, and I understand that this is disabling all 3 amps 6610, 6620 and 6630\n\nI was thinking about replacing U6201. Is this the good way? Other options?"
