        "message":"Hey,\n\nIm struggling with another 820-00850 Board. \nThe MBP ia very slow. I received it with formatted SSD and I can't even install MacOS. It stucks on status \"Less than one minute...\" with progress Bar at ~25%\nI already tested the Board in a Known working case - without luck. I recognized that the LVDS connector Was damaged. Replace the LVDS cable and the screen Connector of the display Assembly. \nNow i'm out of Ideas what could cause this Problem ?\n\nThank you and best regards\nDudiPupan"
