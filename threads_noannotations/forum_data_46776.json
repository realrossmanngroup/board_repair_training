        "message":"No battery connected, connect power to the board in computer, no happy tone nothing on screen, get green then red light so seems to be charging.\nFan spin all ok, but nothing on screen. Hold down power button and fan stops spinning as though it is switched on like usual and just switched off.\nTake board out, connect power, fan spin then gets faster, understanding this to be normal with nothing connected to board. Looking at board, just dust, no liquid damage, no external clues on computer. Poking around board for voltages, have seen most there, not seen all yet as have not checked thoroughly.\nKnowing the issue up to now, does anyone have any clues as to what to look for?\nThanks"
