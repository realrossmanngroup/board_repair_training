        "message":"Hi,\n\nWe have that MacBook Pro 13\" 2012 which came in as the customer was complaining about a slow Mac.\nAs usual on these machines, I did blame first the SATA cable but it was fine.\nDrive did test fine too...\n\nOpening the case we could clearly see a blown capacitor (C6603)\nVoltage drop to ground on PP5V_S3 is 0.1V compared to 0.4V on a know good working board.\n\nSo sensor issue in the end...\n\nWe did remove the blown capacitor and cleanup the PCB which has been damaged since the capacitor was stuck on the ground side.\nTo me it doesn't seem to be a short in the PCB but I could be wrong.\n\nI also did remove U7200, C6601, C6608, C6607 and the power amp U6610 and U6620 but no cigar.\n\nI did then inject 3V on that line and couldn't find any component overheating.\nSame with 5V...\n\nAnyone already had that issued could give some hint?"
