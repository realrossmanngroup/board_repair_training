        "message":"Hello,\nsorry for my bad english. I have a Problem with a 320-3115-B. It has a green light on the charger but wont turn on. I measured the powerrails and noticed, that PP3V42_G3H is 3,62V. I thought that my multimeter could be a little of but PPBUS_G3H is exakt 12,60V. This board had waterdamage but looks very clean overall. I also noticed, that PP3V3_S0 is there but most other S0 rails like PP1V5_S0, PP1V8_S0 or PP1V05_S0 are missing. These are all shorted to groung and i can not find where the short is. Another thing that i noticed is that U1800 is getting a little warm. Means this, that U1800 is shorting the S0 rails to ground or is it only still reciving power anr trying to work? The last and strangest thing i noticed is, that it makes a silent beeping sound in the U1800 areea if its getting power. It sonds like a damaged HDD with a litle click every second. I tryed to attach the sound file to this post (.m4a\/.mp3) but it says invalid file. I\u00b4m not sure if this file is needed but if i can provide it.\nIs there any hope to save this board or is it already dead?\nThank you for your help.\nBest regards,\nFelix"

The CPU is not getting warm at all. I also noticed that the \"height\" of the sound changes if i measure on L6995 (PP3V42_G3H which is 3,6V) and also changes and even stops (and than green light turns off) if i randomly press somewhere on the board."

The short is in pin 2 of L7760 and the diode mode reading is 0,069V, but FB, C7762, C7763 and C7772 are ok. R7760 and R7761 are 6,7Kohm. I assume thats fine. If i put 1V up to 1,8V on L7760 its using max. 0,08A and nothing gets warm."

        "message":"No problem, it\u00b4s amazing and incredible helpful that a place like this exists so a few days dont matter for me. I\u00b4m sure on both of my two boards is at least one component of almost every circuit missing but i see if i can rebuild it on one of them for a measurement. If i can get a comparisson i\u00b4ll let you know. I think that it is to low too because pin 1 of L7760 measures ~0,41V which is in the dimension of many working circuits in my experience... Come back to this if you have time and a board for it :). Thank you!"

Because as i removed L7760 the short only seems to be only on Pin 2. Pin 1 of L7760 was ~0,41V. Or are i searching in the wrong section?"
