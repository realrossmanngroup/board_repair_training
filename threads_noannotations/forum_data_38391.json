        "message":"Hello team Rossmann and Members,\n\n[U][B]Brief intro:[\/B][\/U]\nMy name is Imran Osman\nLive in Mombasa Kenya,\nHave set up an independent repair and parts Apple shop been 2 years,\nI am a self taught Apple repair technician but a Certified Mercedes diagnostic technician so I kinda have a clue on basic repairs.\n\n[U][B]Customer complaint:[\/B][\/U]\nNo display on apple mac book pro 13 inch.\n\n[U][B]My findings:[\/B][\/U]\n\nDevice charges well.\nDevice boots up with chime and fan runs.\nNo display on LCD.\nNo visible damage noted on J8300.\nNo water damage noticed under microscope inspection of board.\n\n\n[U][B]CARRIED OUT FOLLOWING TEST STEPS[\/B][\/U]\n\n[U][B]TEST 1: [\/B][\/U]J8300 pin 1 voltage check= 0.0V\n[B][U]RESULT:[\/U][\/B] I beleive I should get 53v on pin 1 J8300\n\n[U][B]TEST 2:[\/B][\/U] Checked PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT for short to GND at pin 1 J8300\n[U][B]RESULT: [\/B][\/U]the line is [B]NOT[\/B] shorted to GND. Resistance keeps incrementally increasing.\n\n[U][B]TEST 3: [\/B][\/U] Checked the following caps visually for signs of over heating or damage. C7760,C7761,C7762,C7763,C7764,C7765,C7766,C7767,C7 768,C7769,C7770,C7771,C7772,C7773,C7774,C7775,C777 6 AND C7717.\n[U][B]RESULT: [\/B][\/U]None of the caps have signs of heat or water damage. All caps look happy.\n\n[U][B]TEST 4:[\/B][\/U] Decided to check voltage on above caps.\n[U][B]RESULT:[\/B][\/U] All caps read 0.0v on the positive terminals\n\n[U][B]TEST 5:[\/B][\/U] Carried out dide test on D7710 and checked for voltage on each terminal\n[U][B]RESULT:[\/B][\/U] Diode test was ok D7710 passes unidirectionally.\nVoltage test = 0.0V\n\n[U][B]TEST 6: [\/B][\/U]Checked coil L7710 for resistance\n[U][B]RESULT:[\/B][\/U] 0.1 OHM OK\n\n[U][B]TEST 7: [\/B][\/U]Checked caps C7710,C7711,AND C7712 for short to GND\n[U][B]RESULT:[\/B][\/U] None of the above caps were shorted to GND.\n\n\n[U][B]TEST 8: [\/B][\/U]Checked PPVIN_SOSW_LCDBKLT voltage on pins 6,5,2 and 1 at Q7700\n[U][B]RESULT:[\/B][\/U] Voltage= 0.0 V\nComment It should be 12.9 v?\n\n[U][B]TEST 9:[\/B][\/U] Checked voltage at pin 4 of Q7700 PPVIN_SOSW_LCDBKLT_R\n[U][B]RESULT:[\/B][\/U] Voltage of 12.9 V present at pin 4 of Q7700\n\n\n\nA major problem here in Kenya is availability of parts or for that matter even doner boards.\nSo I do not have a test LCD neither do I have a board to pick components from unfortunately.\n\nMy diagnosis led me to Q7700 AND U7700 simply because I reached a dead end since I could not\ncomprehend how the backlight circuit actually works and what factors activate the backlight circuit\non u7700 and thus q7700.\n\nThat said I placed a two weeks order for Q7700 and U7700, replaced both and here I am...........\nstill no voltages on PPVIN_SOSW_LCDBKLT and so no amplification and thus no voltage on\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT. :(\n\n[U][B]QUESTION:[\/B][\/U]\n1.How does Q7700 work and switch ON?\n2.Does Q7700 need to be switched ON by U7700?\n3.If question 3 is a yes, then what factors trigger U7700 to switch ON Q7700\n\nIn short I need help.\n\nThanks and Many Regards from Mombasa Kenya\nImran Osman\nIMspot Repairs."
