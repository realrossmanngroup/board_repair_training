        "message":"Hey guys, \n\nWorking on imac 21.5 - 820 3588. this one came with the problem not turning one. \n\nI open it, removed the board and i noticed that cmos 3V was only with 1.5V. \n\nI replace the pile for a new one and i thought the problem was solved but after 2 days the problem remains! \n\nI already clean_me the original bios tried a new one but no changes! \n\nI already try to shunt the pads directly on board no changes to! \n\nIf i remove and insert the cmos the machine works normal but after 1\/2 days stop turning one! This machine is very unstable. Some times turn on some times not! \n\nalready try to start in SMC bypass don't turn one to! \n\n\n\nhas anyone had any similar problem??"

I \n\n\nI already did a reflow on SMC, jump a wire directly J5120 (SMC_ON_OFF)  to J6901 (PWR_BTN_R) and same history the machine don't turn on when button is pressed! \n\nI've been fixing some old imacs with the similar problem replacing LTC3851. Can this problem be something like that?\n\nthanks"
