When charger connected it goes to 370ma then to 20ma twice then stays at 20ma\n\nU1950 all pins except 8 pulse twice, pin 8 has 3.42v.\n\nU7501\npin 23 - 8.58V\npin 12 - 3.3v\npin 13 - 2.3v ??  should it be 3.3v? no shorts here\npin 22 3.3v\npin 29 - 5v\npin 21 - 3.3v\n\nThen\nL7520 diode .385\nL7560 diode .310\nAlso tried new bios with cleaned me.\n\nU5110 reads\n1-3.42v\n2-gnd\n3-3.42v\n4-2.73v ??? should this be 3.3v?\n5-8 - 3.3v\n\nAny ideas appreciated."
