[\/QUOTE]\n\nLiquid was spill near the spi area and the U6210 area but not to much... the area around the U2700 looks aceptable.. have some red points but nothing serious.. The SYSCLK_CLK32K_RTC At pin 12 of the U2700 have 0.43v stable.. The resistance between pin 17\/18 on U7000 is 03.0 ohms .. On PPVCORE_S0_CPU have 03,3 ohms.. :("
