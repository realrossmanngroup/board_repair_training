        "message":"[LEFT]hey guys, I have a 820-00840 (which im using 820-00875 board schematics and boardview), board had minor liquid spill around u7650, replaced u7650 and damaged capacitors (c7680, c7660, c7653, c7650), and also found PPBUS_G3H shorted to ground, after injecting power Q7680 was causing the short, replaced it, short is gone, but as of now PPBUS_G3H is high, at 13.4Vm any ideas what could be causing PPBUS to be high,[\/LEFT]"
