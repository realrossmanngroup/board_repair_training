        "message":"Hi ive got an 820-00875 turning on and straight off, with board connected when you plug the charger in you will get the battery icon , with an amp meter connected it shows it goes to 19.6v and draws an amperage of .6a then goes down to .26a then off but stays at 19.6v , when measuring cpu vcore at L7210 the voltage does go to .9v then slowly down to 0v, im a bit confused as to where to start looking , the board has no signs of water damage at all. Oh and it still behaves the same with the board out and nothing connected"
