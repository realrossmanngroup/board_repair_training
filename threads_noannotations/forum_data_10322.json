        "message":"Have an 820-4924 that has some liquid damage. \nX for the battery status. SDA for the battery is measuring high (5.8v or so) whereas SCL is 3.4V\n\nNever seen that before so it makes me wonder, on another note i replaced the ISL6259 to rule that out and there was no difference. \n\nIm guessing the SMC's all messed up? \nThanks"
