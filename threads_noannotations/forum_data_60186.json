        "message":"A bit of history before we start\n\nLiquid damage around the SMC and a few other areas. After repairing all the visible damage and traces it was still not turning on. I decided to replace the SMC and it turned out it had quite a bit of corrosion underneath, however, didn't turn on after the new SMC. I left it for the day after and when i tested again it turned on (booted OS just fine). I cleaned the board in ultrasonic and it stopped working again after that. (missing pm_slp_s5_l)\n\nI took a working board with a faulty CPU and started taking known good parts to replace. All of the following i replaced are known good working parts.\nSMC - Didn't work\nU7100 - Didn't work\nU5110 - Didn't work\nU1900 - Worked\n\nSo, I said to myself, perfect, it was the clock. I cleaned the board and boom doesn't work again.\n[U]All the measurements are taken after this point.[\/U]\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.47V\nPPVRTC_G3H - 3.31V\n[COLOR=rgb(226, 80, 65)]EDITED: PM_SLP_S5_L - 1.49V\nPM_SLP_SUS_L - 0V[\/COLOR]\nS5_PWR_EN - 3.3V\n[COLOR=rgb(226, 80, 65)]CHGR_A\/BMON - 0.03V\/0.07V[\/COLOR]\nSMC_BC_ACOK - 3.1V\nPP5V_S5 - 4.98V\nPP3V3_S5 - 3.31V\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.41V\nPP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA - 3.41V\nPP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC - 3.27V\n[COLOR=rgb(226, 80, 65)]SMC_PBUS_VSENSE - 0V[\/COLOR]\n\n\nThere was no damage around u7100 nor around u1900. The damage was heavy in and around the SMC (all fixed) and U8330 (fixed as well)\n\nTLDR:\nThe board didn't work after fixing all the visible damage but turned on fine after 12 hours of sitting.\nIt stopped working again after cleaning and started working after replacing the clock chip.\nIt stopped working again after cleaning and I have no clue why. I cleaned 3 other boards today without any issues.\n\nIt might be worth mentioning that both pins 67 and 68 under the SMC were completely gone due to corrosion but both are saying not connected.\nUsing OEM 85W charger for all tests."
