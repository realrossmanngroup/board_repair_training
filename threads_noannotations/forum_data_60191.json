        "message":"First of all, welcome to the forum!\n\nDon't play again connecting disconnecting battery, when charger is plugged in.\nYou risk to fry the SMC; do NOT force your luck.\n\nIf Magsafe light switch to green, when battery is connected, can mean fully charged battery, or a problem with charging battery circuit.\n\nThe board MUST turn on by itself, when charger is connected (without battery).\nSo do not connect battery again, until fix this.\n\nPost exact ohm resistance between pins 17\/18 and 27\/28 of U7100.\nAlso post U7100 voltages; pins 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 27.\nUse surrounding components as test points."
