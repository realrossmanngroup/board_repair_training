        "message":"Hi there\n\nI have a A1989, 820-00850 board that is not powering on. When i plug in the charger it switches from 5V to 20V, 200-300millamps for about 4-5 seconds and then drops to 0 milliamps. It stays like this for about 10 seconds and then goes back up to 200-300 milliamps, 20V for a few seconds again and then back to 0ma again. It never fully powers up. I have gone over all the usual power rails and the only ones that seem to be missing are PP1V8_S5 and PP1V8_S3.\n\nMachine will not boot into DFU mode (I have tried 20 or so times)\n\nCould this be a T2 chip issue? The MacBook died during a software update (and firmware update, of course) There is absolutely no liquid or corrosion. The board is mint.\n\nIf its a T2 Issue, I did get my hands on a T203 programmer, I havent used it yet. I am just not sure if it can be used to repair the firmware issue, if that is the issue.\n\nAny help is appreciated"
