        "message":"Hello all,\n\nI got this weird laptop that supposedly wasnt turning on.  I let it charge for a while using a known working motherboard and it eventually turned on. With its original MOBO I notice it charges but does not show the typical lightning bolt on the battery icon, it shows nothing at all, just as if the charger was disconnected, however the charge percentage does go up!  When I use the known good motherboard this issue does not occur. When I log into the computer the charge icon finally appears!\n\nAnyone have any advice on this one?  I\"m thinking battery\/battery board? Tried the usual resets with no luck."
