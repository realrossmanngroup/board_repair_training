        "message":"Hi,\nI would like to know is someone have the solution to test GPUs before using them , to avoid lost of time and failures and to loosing time to reball a bad chipset.\nAs all the chipsets from China are craps,  I've seen that for the Xbox 360 and the PS3 some people use a \u03a9 test to test the die, like in this video:\n\nSomeone have the solution for that particulary for these ref:\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial][SIZE=13px]216-0810001\n216-0810005[\/SIZE][\/FONT][\/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial][SIZE=13px]216-0810084[\/SIZE][\/FONT][\/COLOR]\n\nThanks"
