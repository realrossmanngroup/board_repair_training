        "message":"I've done a few no backlights on Airs, but I have never done an older style Pro, so I wanna make sure I get on the right track. I tried a PRAM reset to begin with, but no go. There is no sign of liquid damage anywhere on the board it looks as clean as can be (too clean actually). Took the board out tried a known good 2012 LCD and got nothing, so I started measuring. PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT in diode mode is 0.31 but fluctuates quite a bit. Is it something obvious like a feedback via, or LED driver for sure, or something obvious with that value? I just don't want to remove things like a moron but rather start on the right track and learn something. Any ideas?"

Checked the fuse, 12.56 volts on the PPBUS_G3H side, and zero volts on the other so I would assume it's ok? Checked Q9706 on pins 3 and 4: Pin 4 was 0 volts, pin 3 was 0 volts. R9788 measuring normal same as C9782, R9789 measuring normal."
