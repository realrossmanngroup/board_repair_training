        "message":"Hi,\n\nI have that board with an important liquid damage near U9701 and a slight one near U7201.\nThe board has quarter fan spin.\nWhen the charger is plugged, PPBUS_G3H will come and then drop.\n\nI've checked the current sensing resistors which measure fine.\nI did reflow both areas and replaced U7201. Same issue.\n\nI've replaced the ISL6259, but same issue.\n\nLooking for a short on the rails, I believe I have one on PP1V5_S3RS0 (0.04 on diode mode).\nWhen I remove Q7801, PPBUS_G3H will stay on.\n\nThere are a few parts on this rail and the CPU, of course...\nI will try to remove all the caps and chips on this rail and hope for the best.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"

Put some alcohol on the area and saw both the cap and the transistor were getting hot.\nRemoved the cap and good to go.\n\nEasy to get dawn a rabbit hole though... I got tricked by this Q7801"
