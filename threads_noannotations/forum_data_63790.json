        "message":"First post and long time viewer \/ supporter. \n\nHave an 820-01700 A2141 on the bench that is scary clean and no previous repair attempts (Sudden Death). No signs of liquid exposure or accumulated dust corrosion. \nInitially, it pulled 20v steady but amperage would climb from .2A and within 15-20 seconds make its way to .95A then drop to .01A. Process loops indefinitely.\nKnowing how sensitive these T2's are, I placed it into DFU mode, that held until a revive attempt was made, then it disconnects within 20 seconds w\/ error: AMRestoreErrorDomain error 9. \n\nAfter the DFU attempt, the system now alternates between the initial 20vdc to 5.14vdc then back to 20v @ .01A. \n20v stays for 6s and 5.14v for 20s.\n\nSuspecting a NAND\/SSD power issue, I checked SSD0 and SSD1 and both measured fine with 2.5v and no short to ground when battery is disconnected.\nWhen battery is connected, it will stay steady @ 2.5v when 20v goes to 5v but right before it goes back to 20v, SSD0 & SSD1 drop to 0v for 3s then returns back to 2.5v.\nNever seen anything like it.\n\nPP_G3H - 12.6v while pulling 5.14v from USB-C then 12.76v while pulling 20v.\nPP0V9_SSD1 - 0.88v\nPP0V9_SSD0 - 0.88v\nPP5V_G3S - 5.13v\nPP1V8_G3S - 1.79v\nPP3V3_G3H_SSD0_SNS - 3.38\nPPBUS_HS_CPU - 12.6v\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 0.00v\n\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 2 ohms to ground which I think is normal with these newer CPUs. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I know my way around the brd and schematics and can provide any test points needed."
