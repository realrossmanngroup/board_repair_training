        "message":"Hey Guys,\n\nWe've got a A2141 which had some liquid damage around U6420 and we're experiencing a weird fault with the sound.\n\nWe hear the chime when the Mac boots (although it sounds like the speaker has blown but tested in another housing and still the same) and we also hear when the charger is connected but no sound once the Macbook fully boots.\n\nHeadphones work perfectly.\n\nA google search suggested entering 'sudo killall coreaudiod' in terminal which then temporarily gets the sound working but then after 10-15seconds the sound cuts out again.\n\nWe've checked the audio settings and these all seem fine. Checked diode\/voltages against known good and these are all fine also.\n\nIs this a software based fault?"
