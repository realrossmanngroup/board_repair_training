        "message":"Hey Guys!\n\nWe've got a A1706 with touchbar that is failing to update. We've tried disconnecting the touchbar, front camera, updating with a different MacOS and still the same. I read somewhere to check U4200 and U3900 in case of any minor corrosion and these are pristine. \n\nAlso tested the board in a different housing and still the same error.\n\nNot sure where to check next.\n\nJust to add that the Macbook boots in safe mode as expected. \n\nAny pointers would be much appreciated! Thank you"
