        "message":"Hello all,\n\nThis may seem to be very weird, but I repair daily liquid damaged MacBooks and never have an issue. Now after all this time, I get an A1466 with no liquid damage and all signs and rails show there shouldn't be a problem. Just not getting chimes and I plug in a mouse and it just blinks popping on the mag safe and the fan immediately does what it's supposed to do, but after second spin on the fan, the CPU gets so hot you cannot even touch it. I have reprogrammed the BIOS, reflowed the SMC.....\n\nI'm at a loss and really confused, I know I am probably missing something really stupid"

I learned my lesson 2 years ago on a Mac Logic Board especially these, not to run them with out the heatsink as it will damage (which happened in my case) the CPU.\n\nAs for you saying \"not recommend to force CPU\", I am sorry I worded that wrong as I was following your instructions to force turn off the board and check if CPU still stays hot which it doesn't. My apologies for wording that all wrong.\n\nPLT_RESET_L shows 3.33v turning on and off\n\nBIOS is same BIOS I use for the Logic Board with Clear ME for all repairs of the model Logic Board."
