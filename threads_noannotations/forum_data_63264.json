        "message":"Hi, I have this 820-01700 board which came with no power. After inspection, I saw that the SSD line is shorted on PP2V5_NAND_SSD0, PP1V8_SSD0, and PP0V9_SSD0. Also, U9580 had to be replaced because it was shorting PPBUS_G3H. I replaced U9580 and U9500 to be sure all is good and found that ALL SSD chips from the left side are dead all burned on one of the lines mentioned above. Now there are no electronic issues, but I cannot get it to enter DFU mode, so I was wondering if anyone has experience if it's possible to boot DFU mode only with one side SSD chips. It boosts to 20v goes up to 0.4amps then 0.6, 0.7 and goes back down and again in a loop to 0amps.\n\nIdeas would be appreciated :) Thanks"

        "message":"[QUOTE=\"iFix, post: 95989, member: 20112\"]\nHi.\n\nI'm back on this one. I received the SSD chips. 6 x 128GB TSB4228. In the package, they sent 6 chips of which one was from a different spot. I first tried to solder them as they were from the spots where they came from since the supplier advised us like that, but it didn't work. Then I took them out again, but this time I reprogrammed them with the P13 and for the first time the process of Revive went through and I get to the Lock sign as referred on the Wiki page. After I do the Revive it says the Apple Controller is Booted, but I cannot restore it, and even during the Revive process I don't get the Logo as normally should. I attached pictures of different variants of the process but I think it gets stuck on Exclusive Device Connection. Also, note that when I wanna reprogram the chips on P13 the only combinations that it shows are 1Tb and 512GB.\n\nAny ideas would be appreciated. Thanks\n[\/QUOTE]\nYou problem can be here.\nYou have 128G nand, or your configuration is 6, so you need 192G NAND."
