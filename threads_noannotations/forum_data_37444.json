D9410 is getting 3.3v, so what the hell is dragging this thing down to ground?\n\nU9410 and the resistors and caps around it were replaced. Pin, 7, 6, 5 are still shorted and getting nothing at C9412, R9410 and R9411 but about 2mA at C9410 and very slowly climbs up a little."

I meant display port and actually completely forgot about checking USB circuitry cause of this annoying short that seems to be in the board. I'll have to see if the USB port is grounded to the same spot. It's J4600. I've fixed this problem before but this board is pretty bad."
