        "message":"Gday guys I'm using schematics for 820-3332 so hope layout is similar. unit has corrosion on c8513 PP1V5R1V35_S0GPU would this cause no backlight? because I wouldn't think so unless this rail must be complete before backlight shows up. or is it as simple as replace backlight driver? I'm getting 0.560 Diode on L9000. I'm not 100% familiar with this retina model so any help would be great. I'm getting 12v on both sides of the fuse."
