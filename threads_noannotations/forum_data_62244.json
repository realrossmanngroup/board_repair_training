(I took pictures before cleaning - please check the attachments)\nAfter removing\/replacing the broken stuff (caps, 94AGTJIELC180) and cleaning the corrotion the device booted fine .... it also worked for 2 whole days.\n\nBut after trying to run \"Diagnose Mode\" it stopped working and now I cant even restore the system via USB or internet recovery. (Error -2003F | Progress bar is kinda weird)\nFurthermore I cant see the hard drive (SSD) when I press \"Option\" ... is the SSD\/T2 bad?\n\nNote:\nDFU restore\/repair via apple configurator 2 worked fine .. so no problem overall.\n\nI measured some of the important voltages:\n[LIST]\n[*]PPBUS_G2H = 12.57v\n[*]PP3V3_G3H = 3.3V\n[*]P3V3MAIN_PGOOD = 3.2V\n[*]PP3V_G3H_RTC = 3.0V\n[*]P5VG3S_EN = 1.8V\n[*]PP5V_G3S = 5.1V\n[*]PP1V2_AWAKE = 1.2v\n[*]PP1V8_AWAKE = 1.8v\n[*]PP3V3_AWAKE = 3.3v\n[*]PP0V8_SLPS2R = 0.8v\n[*]PP1V8_SLPS2R = 1.8v\n[*]PP1V1_SLPS2R = 1.1v\n[*]PMU_PVDDMAIN_EN = 3.3V\n[*]PP1V8_S3_MEM = 1.8v\n[*]PP1V2_S3 = 1.2V\n[\/LIST]\nAfter trying \"Diagnose Mode\" again it says \"No issues found.\" Sadly still not working.\n\nAny idea?"
