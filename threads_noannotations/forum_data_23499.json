        "message":"Hi,\n\nI got a odd one here, i cant solve. So hoping someone has seen this before.\nThis Laptop came in with no image. This was fixed by soldering around U8900 (i think thats the chip). However, once the laptop gets to the login screen the fans start to ramp up to full speed.\n\nI have tried a known good OSX and its still the same.\nThis unit passes ASD EFI & OS, as well as the VST & MRI.\n\nThe odd thing is, when this unit is in diagnostics mode, the fans are perfect.\n\nI'm seriously stuck on this !!!"

Also with a clean OSX it does the same.\nWhen battery fully charged, PPBUS only gets to 11.5V. Once unplugged its back to 12.6V.\n\nWaiting for ebay battery to test with.....other than that i've no idea."
