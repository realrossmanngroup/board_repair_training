        "message":"Hi guys! This is my first repair on a 820-00875.\nCustomer report no power after a small water spill near trackpad.\nWhen I connect usb-c 61w power unit, fan starts and spin at lightspeed. Nothing else happens.\nAfter checking power lines found that PP3V3_S0 is missing (0,6v).\nFound some corrosion under U8220, PM_EN_P3V3S0 and PP3V3_S5_S0R are present and stable.\nI've tried to clean\/resolder U8220 but no success, still 0,6v on PP3v3_S0.\nCan u8220 be burned? it looks perfect... I should try to bypass it and inject 3v3 on PP3V3_S0 and see what happens?\nThank you in advance. (y)"
