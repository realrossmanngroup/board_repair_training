        "message":"I'm having a hard time with this particular board. It's an 820-2850 with no power:\n\n1. PPBUS_G3H bounces from 12.6v down to 3,5v, then back up. SMC_PM_G2_EN is also pulsing, as are my S5 rails, fan move just a few.\n2. PP3v42_G3H stable at 3.42v. Green light solid.\n3. Resistance at [URL=\"https:\/\/store.rossmanngroup.com\/isl6259ahrtz.html\"]U7000[\/URL] (17\/18, 27\/28) is normal (~3ohm and ~20ohm). Pin 3 of [URL=\"https:\/\/store.rossmanngroup.com\/isl6259ahrtz.html\"]U7000[\/URL]=4V.\n4. No power from charger or battery, however, PPBUS does NOT pulse when a battery is connected only (i.e., with battery plugged in, ppbus stays steady), however, the board still will not power on with battery.\n5. I can't find a short anywhere; I've checked pp3v3_s5, pp5v_s5, pp3v3_s3, pp5v_s3, pp5v_s0, pp3v3_s0, pp1v05_s5, PPBUS, PP3v42, etc. Couldn't find a short anywhere that might be causing the board to cycle.\n6. SMC_RESET_L is stable at 3.4v, however, it drops to 3.3v for a split second every time the board cycles\/rails fluctuate.\n7. R7020\/R7050 measure fine.\n8. no liquid or trace on the board.\n9. what can i do? do you have some idea?\nthanks"
