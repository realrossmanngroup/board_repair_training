        "message":"820-3437 PM_SLP_S4_L, I am thinking dead CPU\/PCH, but wanted a second opinion, or something else to check. \n\n[B]Device History:[\/B]\nLiquid damage near:\nSPI area\nJ6100\nU7400\nU1950\nU7501\nI cleaned these areas, replaced what was obviously damaged (Several capacitors\/resistors, U7501, U1950, removed J6100)\n\n\n[B]Voltages: [\/B]\nPPBUS: 8v58\nPPVRTC_G3H: 3v3\nRTC_RESET_L: 3v3\nPCH_SRTCRST_L: 3v3\nPCH_INTVRMEN_L: 3v3\nPCH_DSWVRMEN_L: 3v3\nPCH_CLK32K_RTCX1: .500v\nPP3V3_S5: 3v3\nPM_DSW_PWRGD: 3v3\nPP3V3_SUS: 3v3\nPM_BATLOW_L: 3v3\nPM_RSMRST_L: 3v3\nPM_PWRBTN_L: 3v3 \nPM_SLP_SUS_L: 3v3\nPM_SLP_S5_L: 0v0\n\n\n[B]SPI: [\/B]\nAs stated, I have removed J6100, I have checked all the SPI resistors, and traces. Made sure they all have continuity to where they need to go. Removed SMC, confirmed traces under there as well, and replaced to be sure. These have all checked okay. I also replaced BIOS with known good for testing. \n\nUnit does not boot in SMC bypass mode\n\nPM_PWRBTN_L does not respond when shorting SMC_ONOFF\n\n\nAs always, thanks in advance 2informaticos"
