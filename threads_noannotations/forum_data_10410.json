It was liquid damaged \nI don't know where exactly, because it was cleaned before I received it.\n\nCorrosion:\nAround LVDS\nKB backlight connector\nJ6100 - I removed it\nU7200 - some corrosion next to it.\n\nI cleaned the board.\n\nThe board goes to S0 state, but CPU Vcore does not present.\nMissing CPU_VR_EN.\n\nPPVMEMIO_S0_CPU 1.205V\nPP1V05_S0 is present.\n\nALL_SYS_PWRGD - 3.3V\n\nY1905 - oscillates\nL7630 - 1.05V\nPCH slowly gets warm\n\nU7200 powers on as far there are PP5V_S0 and PPVIN_S0_CPUVR_VIN.\n\nShould I just change U7200 or is there something I'm missing?\n\nThank you."
