        "message":"This 820-00165 came in dead by a small amount of water\n\nBad corrosion on U8005. Pulled and replaced U8005 with new one and wired pin1 to C8005\/p1 as this trace was burned. Also replaced C8005.\n\nNow there is no fan spin, and all pins (PP5V_S0, PCH_HSIO_PWR_EN, PP1V05_S0, PP1V05_S0, SW_PCH_HSIO) on U8005 are low (a couple of mV)\n\nBut if I pull U8005 off the board only PP1V05_S0SW_PCH_HSIO is low... The other ones PP5V_S0 = 5V, PP1V05_S0 = 1.05V, PCH_HSIO_PWR_EN = 3.3V and the fan starts spinning.\n\nBoard does not boot obviously without this chip.\n\nDiode mode U8005:\n\non the board:\n\np1: 0.43\np2: 0.10\np3: 0.10\np5: 0.18\np7: 0.18\np8: 0.00\np9: 0.46\n\noff the board:\n\np1: 0.43\np2: 0.09\np3: 0.09\np5: 0.17\np7: 0.17\np8: 0.00\np9: 0.46\n\nWhat's going on ?"
