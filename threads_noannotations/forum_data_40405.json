        "message":"Hi,\n\nI have a board that will boot from ASD flash drives but it won't boot from my USB 2.5\" SSD macOS test drive. The other problem is that when the wifi card is connected, it won't boot. I'm guessing it's to do with the BT side. Tried with a known good card.\n\nI also noticed that the USB controller test in ASD failed when I had my 2.5\" USB SSD connected. At the same time, the screen was extremely flickery. I couldn't reproduce the behaviour again though.\n\nThis board has had liquid damage but it's been worked on before :( So there is flux and probe scrapes all over the place. Any help would be appreciated."

My SSD USB draws around 300mA at the highest I have seen on my USB meter and the voltage stays at 5V. \n\nI just noticed that there is long screw damage on the heatsink screw for U1100. It's the one between the RAM and U1100. Considering the USB comes from U1100, there is a good chance that a trace got smooshed into the ground plane or something."
