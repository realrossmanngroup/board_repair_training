        "message":"I have another one of those nightmare retina's where the trackpad is frozen. The voltage on the trackpad pin 1 PP3V3_TPAD_CONN is 1.56v, when I remove the trackpad cable it is 3.3v. So i replaced both the cable and trackpad but as soon as I connect the trackpad, the same happens! I also ran it without any other devices conncted (Battery, display, I\/O board and SSD) but the same still happens. Any ideas? Board itself looks clean no liquid spils.\n\nEdit: also tried another keyboard still freezes, keyboard works fine however, Apple OSD test says no issues found"
