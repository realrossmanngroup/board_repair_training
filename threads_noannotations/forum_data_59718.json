        "message":"Hello friends, how are you? I am new to this repair of macbooks, I mainly dedicate myself to iphone. An 820-3332 came to my workshop that only turned on with a battery and when I connected the magsafe and the green LED blinked, change u7000 and measuring it had no PP5V1_CHGR_VDDP\nremove R7001 and got green light then orange\nreplace q7080 and fix that fault.\nnow when I connect with a charged battery it says the battery is exhausted and it does not turn on, then I connect the magsafe and with the battery connected it marks a level of 60% and it works very slow. From already thank you very much"
