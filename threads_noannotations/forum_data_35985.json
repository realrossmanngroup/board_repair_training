        "message":"This 820-3115 came in with no power, history unknown.\nNo liquid damage. or any other kind of damage I can spot.\n\nInitially found the PPDCIN to fluctuate slightly. Traced this back to starting point at Q7080. Replaced Q7080 and the fluctuation was gone.\nNow PPBUS was low at 4volts. Replaced F7020.\nNow PPBUS_G3H fluctuates between 6 and 8 volts on F7020.\nAlso replaced U7000 because why not, this did not change anything.\nR7080 and R7081 checked out as having the right values.\n\nChecked for short on PPBUS and most of the times I get 25 kilo-ohm but other times it fluctuates a lot.\n1.4 ohm between pins 23\/24 on U7000, 21.8Kilo-ohm between pins 16\/17.\nGreen light on the charger was intermittent but now stays on solid green. Power draw on PSU is 0.014 - 0.020 amps with occasional high spikes to 0.096 or somewhere in that area (it happens really fast).\n\nCould use a few pointers to get me in the right direction. 820-3115 are my mortal enemies and except for RAM pin issues, these make me pull my hair out (what little is left) constantly.\n\nAny help appreciated :)"
