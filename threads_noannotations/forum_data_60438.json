        "message":"Arrived with liquid damage and the fan spinning fast the second it was powered on.\n\nU8130 and R8133 were replaced along with U5110 and R5125. After replacement no change still fast fan second it was powered on with no light.\n\nAfter replacing the SMC, fan spins normal now light is back but turns off after a few seconds, then turns back on with no usb activity or chime. During the first fan spin draws around 336 ma. When it turns back on draws the normal amperage is drawn around 550-600ma\n\nTried known good bios with no change.\n\nSound like bad CPU from U8130 and R8133 being hit with liquid? If not what should be checked next??\n\nAlso heated CPU with good flux"
