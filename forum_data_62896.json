        "message":"Hi, today I receive this machine, fan speed is high always, it takes 3 or 4 bottom press to power up, it doesn't power up just connecting charger.\n\nI install hwsensors and only shows SSD T\u00b0, also battery info is not available. Battery don't charge, and when battery is plug, charger light turn green and orange randomly.\n\nNo water damage or other damage visible in the board. I also try another trackpad, same problem and booting another High Sierra from USB, to see if the problem was the OS.\n\nCan it be SMC failure, should I reball it or change it? or is something else?"
