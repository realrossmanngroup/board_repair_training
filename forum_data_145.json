        "message":"820-2936 was originally liquid damaged. There was corrosion around the LVDS connector. I cleaned the board and swapped the LVDS connector. Backlight works but it seems that not all the LEDs are working. I'm getting a spotty LED backlight pattern (see photos). It's not the display because I tried several other displays with the same exact result. Any ideas?"

Inbetween the LCD connector and the LED driver, there are resistors, on the LED return lines. If any one of those return lines is broken, you get those shadows.\n\nSo either\n\n1) The LCD connector pin is corroded.\n2) The pathway between the LCD connector and the LED return resistor is corroded.\n3) The LED return resistor is open and bad.\n4) The pathway between the LED return resistor and the LED driver, U9701 is bad.\n5) U9701 is bad or has a corroded ball underneath it.\n\nWhich of the 5 it is will be your adventure to measure, but it should be obvious if you look at the board."

Not really sure why there are 6 return lines, in theory it should be possible to tie them all together and just make it one. I guess it must have something to do with the design of the LED driver chip or LCD."
