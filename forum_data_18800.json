        "message":"This macbook had a short in the board neard d7701, and the backlight driver feedback line was burned away.\n\nI drilled a hole until the short to ground was gone, replaced the fuse and backlight driver, and ran a wire to replace the LCDBKL_FB line to the backlight driver.\n\nBacklight works, laptop boots, and the fuse does not blow. However, the backlight no longer adjusts normally. Flickers between settings instead of fading, and the backlight turns off halfway down the on screen display's scale.\n\nAny thoughts? Crappy backlight driver soldering? Or BKL_PWM issue? \n\nThanks."
