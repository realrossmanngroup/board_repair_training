        "message":"Its a previous repair attempt,\nppvrtc is present\npp5v_s5 and pp3v3_s5 are present\nppbus_g3h is 12.56\nadapter en and bat_low and pm_dsw_pwrgd is there.\npp3v3_sus is 3.3v.\nchecked resistors around u6100 and they look fine.\n\npp5vs4 comes for few seconds when adapter is plugged in and then it goes to 0\n\n\nFollowed enable pin(4) of u7501 and checked for pm_slp_s5_l and its 0 volts and same goes for smc_s4_wakesrc_en .\ni have replaced u7501 just to be sure that its not pulling enable signal low but the result was same. So i removed u8170 and measured pins without it and there was 5 volts on pin 4 which is s4_pwr_en, as far as i know there shouldn't be anything on pin 4 if u8170 was missing\n\nand p5vs4 comes without u8170 and it stops when i put it back\n\nany ideas what i should do next"
