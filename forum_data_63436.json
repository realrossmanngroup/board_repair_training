        "message":"Hi, everybody,\n\nI have the following problem: Macbook A2141, Motherboard 820-01700. The display isn't turning on, fans are spinning, no image on external monitor. The problem occured while Macbook was turned on.\n\nVoltage is there in all elements except for PPVCCGT_S0_CPU. Current consumption is 1.8A when laptop is turned on. Usually I think it should show 5V and then 20V, this one shows 20V immediately, don't know if this is a clue. Communication between U7100 and CPU is lacking (not sure if this is a problem or not, when does it have to be there).\n\nPlease give me some clues on how to proceed. I'm in a dead end!\n\nThanks!"
