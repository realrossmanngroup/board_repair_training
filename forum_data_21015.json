        "message":"I have 820-00138 yellow light doesn't charge, \n\nI found few threads, having the same issue they are all closed without resolution on this forum. So I will give it another try. My board is beraly water damage. turns on with battery, when connect charger percentage jumps to 100% I tried pram reset before realizing it doesnt charge. and doesn't turn on with battery unplugged.\n\nISL6259 gets power\nbetween pins\n 17\/18 - 4ohm\n27\/28 - 15 m ohm\n20v PPBUS\n\n\nwhat I think L7560 - has only 1v\nif I remove coil one side has almost short 250 ohm - P3V3S5_CSN2 is that normal or is it even L7560? I removed TPS51980 and resistance hasn't change. \n\n1 photo of the element that had water damage. the other photo of L7560"

I have 1.5v on L7130, I think the problem is that transistor doesn't open Q7130. from what I understand it runs by voltage difference on G and S. But U7100 pin 23 and 24 have the same voltage, resistance between pins is 23k. I replaced ISL6259 still 1.5v on both 23 and 24. any ideas?\n\nM ohm is megaohm, I measure it again and it is 33 mohm"

        "message":"so just got to it today, I run jumper between pin 27(R7122) and R7120, resistance normal now 21 ohm. After plugin in power cord spark on C4696, I removed it. I still have short on L7560. after few min, green light disappear. later I figure out C7552 in short. I replaced it, after I fixed it I tried to boot macbook with battery, another usb capacitor blown sparked( first c4696). all three capacitors are on PP5V_S4_REG, started blowing for some reason.\n\nPPBUS_G3H voltage increased to 4v. L7560 1.8v I tried to apply 1v to PP3V3_S5_REG as a result U1100 get warm, am I up to sth or it is just first thing to get warm and I have another big capacitor in short?.\nI am really stuck here, Duke any ideas on how to go about this one?"
