        "message":"got this unit with high fan spin. found bad battery. after replacement fan is ok.\n\nwhen i click on the sleep mode, the device goes into sleep mode and wakes up again normally. but when i close the lid it also goes into sleep mode, but after opening it, the display remains dark.\n\ni have already installed a new speaker, assuming the hall sensor is the problem, but the result is the same. then i changed the audioboard, but no change. the original audioboard has a white headphone jack, but my replacement board has a black jack. are there any differences? in diode mode, the readings on the speaker connector are the same."
