However PP1V5R1V35_GPU_REG was only 1.5ohms. Vram was red hot after a couple of minutes. \nI've replaced vram, pinky dots gone, but worse blocky patterns. Took Vram off, and display nice and clean. maybe I put on bad vram or gpu is bad as well. I'll crack it tomorrow.\n\nIm starting to see a increase in 820-3330 boards from non liquid spill issues."

In the worst cases, some would \"hang\" on the Apple logo (which was color-distorted), and \"wouldn't boot\" fully into the OS (turns out they were booting, but the LCDs were bad and not showing the login screen, only the discolored Apple logo). That's the only reason I mentioned the LCD at first; of course, if you tried several LCDs, then that's not the issue. This was just the first thing I thought of, and you hadn't mentioned trying several LCDs, so figured I'd mention it.\n\nCertainly wasn't saying for sure that the LCD was 100% bad and should be replaced. Just that it's worth checking into; that's all. I'll edit that reply since it's clearly incorrect."
