        "message":"Hi guys I have a Retina 3476 that had a tiny liquid spil on U7501, see attached images. Rest of board looks good.\n\n- 12.65v coming in at pin 23 VIN\n- 3.43v at pin 21 S5_PWR_EN\n- 3.43 at pin 12 SMC_PM_G2_EN\n- 0v at P5VS4RS3_EN Pin 4\n\nSeems I need to troubleshoot the P5VS4RS3_EN signal which I did:\n\n- R8179 = 0 ohm and 0v\n- R8175 = 0 ohm\n\n- R8178 = 100ohm\n- U8180 = 3.34v on pin 5 ov on Pin 1\n- R8185 = 0 ohm\n- R8184 = 330ohm\n- R8186 = 36.6k (schematics says 39K, checked another board its 37K should be OK?)\n- R8187 = 0 ohm\n- R8183 = 325 ohm\n- R8188 = 58k ohm (schematics says 68k, another board I have is also 58 so seems OK)\n\nAny suggestions what to look for? Whats should PM_SLP_S3_L show for voltage? Any suggestions welcome:D."

I measured CPU Vcore it was 1.74v at R7310 oin 1 and then drops to 0 and fan stops spinning.\n\nAnother update, now i kept it on the charger for a longer time with battery connected. The fan starts spinning max and does not switch of anymore. CPU VCore is at 1.739v. The USB can power an external drive, but mouse doesnt light up.\n\nEdit: could it be current sensing issue?"
