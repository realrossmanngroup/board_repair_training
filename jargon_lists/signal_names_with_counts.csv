"PM_SLP_S4_L","1888","PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S4 state, and is necessary for you to get common rails such as PP5V_S4 and PP5V_S3 to work. On many systems that have no power due to random liquid damage, it will be traced back to missing PM_SLP_S4_L. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \"PM\" prefix typically stands for \"Power Management,\" and the \"SLP\" is for \"Sleep.\" The \"S4\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \"_L\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal. When PM_SLP_S4_L is active (low), it indicates that the MacBook is in or should transition to the S4 power state, where the system context is saved to disk, and most of the system is powered down except for what's necessary to maintain this state and wake up again.  This control is crucial for power conservation and managing the different sleep states of the MacBook, ensuring that power is supplied to only essential components during these low-power states​.
