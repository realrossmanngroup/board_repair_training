U7100,U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present,
CD3215,This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook won’t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v.,
U1950,This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing,
U6100,this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on.,
ISL6259,This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015,
U7800,,
U1900,,

U7501,"This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0",
U7200,,
U7400,,
U3200,,
U8900,This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15” Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time.,
U7701,,
U5110,This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models.,
U7600,,
CD3217,This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook won’t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v.,

U5701,"this is the keyboard controller chip that takes the keyboard and trackpad input and turns it into a USB device signal for the machine to process. If replacing a keyboard doesn’t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. ",
