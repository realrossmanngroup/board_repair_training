PP3V3_S3,,"Hey there, fellow tech warrior! ✊ 

No need to dust off the schematics just yet, let's break down that cryptic ""PP3V3_S3"" on a Macbook logic board. Here's the intel:

**PP3V3_S3:**

* **PP:** Power Plane. Think of it as a named electrical circuit carrying a specific voltage.
* **3V3:** That's the voltage, a crisp 3.3 volts. 
* **S3:** This one's a bit trickier. It represents a specific power state or domain within the Macbook. In this case, it likely refers to the **S3 sleep state**, also known as ""Standby"". S3 allows the system to save power while retaining RAM content, enabling a quick resume when you wake it up.

So, **PP3V3_S3** essentially translates to **the 3.3-volt power plane supplying various components during the S3 sleep state**. Now, the specific components it powers will depend on the Macbook model and year, but it typically includes:

* **Real-Time Clock (RTC):** Keeps track of time even when the system is asleep.
* **Low-power USB controllers:** Allows limited USB functionality in S3, like charging your iPhone.
* **Some sensors:** Like the accelerometer for wake-on-LAN functionality.

Remember, this is just a general overview. If you're troubleshooting a specific Macbook, the exact components powered by PP3V3_S3 might differ. For that, you'd need the board's specific schematics.

One last thing: If you're ever unsure about a specific power plane or voltage on a Macbook logic board, don't hesitate to reach out! This community of tech wizards is always happy to share knowledge and lend a hand.

3V3_G3H,"This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. ",
PCH_DSWVRMEN,"DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.
If this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.

If the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself.",
S5_PWRGD,"The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD.",
