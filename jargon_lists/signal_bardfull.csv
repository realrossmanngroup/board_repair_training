PWRBTN_L,"PWRBTN_L Is an abbreviation of PM_PWRBTN_L which refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The ""L"" at the end of ""PM_PWRBTN_L"" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence.",
