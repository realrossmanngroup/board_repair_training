        "message":"Hello,\ni am working on a 820-2915 that has no green light. It was water damaged an i fixed some corrosion already. Now, if i plug the charger in it shows a green light for a second but than it turns off again. Without unplugging the charger the light comes back on after a minute or so and than turns off again instantly. (actually one or two times i want to measure it it stays on and the cpu was getting warm) I measured around and saw that SMC_BC_ACOK is not there and also CHGR_DCIN (and so also CHGR_ACIN) is not there (causing The ISL6259 to stop working and SMC_BC_ACOK to be missing). I checked for a short to GND on CHGR_DCIN but there is no. CHGR_ACIN is something between 1,2V and 0,6V (slowls fading) until it peaks to 16V (when the green light appears for a second) and than fades away again. I already replaced U7000 twice (to be sure because the probepoint of CHGR_DCIN next to U7000 was corroded and not conducting anymore but the actual Pad (Pad 2) of U7000 and the rest of the line looks fine so far- i fixed that probepoint). I also had to run a wire under (to pin 3) Q7080 because there was another a no longer conducting Probepoint. Now my wire (at pin 3) is conducting connected to the metal case of Q7080 (i measured some voltages there and discovered this connecction) but as far as i understand: this in clearly not ideal and i\u00b4ll correct that if it works but for now it should not be the problem, as the case of Q7080 is only soldered to NC Pads on the board. I also followed CHGR_DCIN to F6905 and PPDCIN_G3H is also only 1,2V-0,6V. Now i don\u00b4t know hat to do. I tryed a different DCIN board already and i will try another tomorow to make sure it is fine.\nThanks for any help!"

Than i can also see an apple (with no backlight - ill adress that when it works) on the screen and a normal picture on an external monitor. But it needs really long to turn the green light on. Can this be caused by the keyboard\/Trackpad connector?"

I also corrected my jumper so that it is no longer connected to the case of Q7080 (i measured all connections of Q7080 and they conduct only to where they should  (i also checked them the first time... maybe the Q7080 i took from a donor was slowly dying...)) and now it turns on every time. But Q7080 is still getting hot. On this machines the whole board is pretty hot so i guess that is normal for this model. I repaired the backlight and after that i noticed that it won\u00b4t boot up all the way. If i try to install an OS but it hangs after the apple disappears and it i want to boot from a drive with an OS installed.  It also stops with a white screen after the apple finished loading. I tryed differend HDDs and HDD cables but still the same. Even without the HDD cable connected it won\u00b4t get to the installation menu. Now i am stuck again"

The trace to the ISL is fine and the trace under Q7080 (pin 3) is my jumper and should be fine as far as i can measure. Is there a way to start it using just the integrated Intel GPU for testing? Is this the model where C9560 fails often?"
