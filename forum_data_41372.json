        "message":"No luck with the reflow. I have been reading the datasheet for SiC631 (U7410). The actual chip on the logic board is SiC635 but I can't find the datasheet for it and this one seems functionally the same. If I understand it correctly, the SiC chip (U7410 etc) needs communication from the controller (U7100) on the PWM pin. The signal tells it how and when to switch the built in mosfets. When I measure the voltage on the PWM pin of U7410 (pin1) I get 2.59V and it's just a straight DC signal. I double checked with the scope to see if there was a PWM signal and it's just a DC voltage.\n\nI replaced U7410, U7420 and U7100 but it still has the exact same symptoms. I also checked that there is continuity between pin1 of U7410 and pin 25 of U7100. So my guess is that the 2.59V I'm reading on pin 1 U7410 is a result of the chip being put in tri-state mode by U7100. So where is the signal I'm missing that is causing U7100 to disable my missing voltage rails?"
