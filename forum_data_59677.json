        "message":"Originally arrived with no power minor liquid damage on R66680. Replaced and issue was solved.  Two months later it has returned for warranty. No power again. All power rails present. PP5V_SO is power cycling up to .268V then drops to 0V. Board was ultrasoniced after repair and still looks spotless under microscope.\n\nAny ideas what should be checked next?"
