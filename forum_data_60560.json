        "message":"Hi , ive got an 820--01598 with no display, no signs of any liquid spill at all , board is very clean , ive tried 2 new screens . I can hear the charger being put in and out . not sure what voltages i should have without the screen connected but i have 5V on PP5V_SOSW_LCD_R and 0v ON  PP3V3_SOSW_LCD ,  PP3V3_G3H_RTC is present at U8501 but LCD_PWR_SLEW_3V3 is missing (diode reading 698) along with PANEL_P3V3_EN (diode reading 555),  should these voltages be there without a screen connected on this model ."
