R9788 & R9789 are a voltage divider whose purpose it is to send 5v to the gate of Q9706. A voltage divider needs a path to a lower voltage\/ground on the \"bottom\" for it to work though, which means R9789 needs a path to ground.\n\nR9789 doesn't get a path to ground unless Q9707 opens. LCD_BKLT_EN and BKLT_PLT_RST_L need to be present in order for Q9707 to open, allow R9788\/R9789 voltage divider to work, and allow Q9706 to pass power.\n\nThis usually happens when the LCD is recognized. If LCD_BKLT_EN isn't present, either SMC_LID is stuck at a low voltage because of corrosion by BIL connector or the machine doesn't recognize the LCD.\n\nWhat voltage is present on pin 2\/3, and 4 of the LCD connector?"
