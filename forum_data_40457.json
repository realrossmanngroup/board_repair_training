        "message":"Hi, \n\nMacbook runs sluggish, fans slowly ramp up to full speed.\n\nI've run ASD 3S162 and got 2 errors: ID0R and TsoP. \n\nThere is some corrosion at J4800 as well as I found 3 probe points to have some corrosion. (I've scratched gently)\n\nAs for the ID0R, I've checked R5441, measures 45kOhms. It has continuity to ISL pin 9. No corrosion around SMC or ISL. C5441 looks good too.\n\nI feel like solving touchpad sensor could solve DC-in sensor. \n\nAny ideas?"

        "message":"Fans gradually ramping to full speed is usually related to TS0P, since TS0P sensor is located in the trackpad, either bad trackpad, bad trackpad cable or bad traces\/pins on J4800. When SMC can't read trackpad sensor temperature it ramps up the fan.\n\nIn your case I am sure it's your connector.\njust by looking I see pin 19 look very bad 17 also, these 2 pins communicate TS0P with SMC. \nI would first touch up the pins and see if it looks great again. Otherwise remove, clean and replace.\n\nBy the way, I like this kind of connector it s easier to inspect and to test the soldered pins with internal pins. Not like for example macbook air one where you need to slide in the cable. Usually even when it looks imaculate, you still can't catch a small piece of metal inside shorting out the pins.\nWhen it s liquid damage and the cable stay crusty inside the connector, sometimes a small piece from the trackpad stay stuck inside."

You were right, pins 17 & 19 were bad, but not on motherboard connector, instead of trackpad connector. All eaten up. I've cleaned it, put new solder, tested, works perfect!\n\nCase solved! Thank you everyone."
