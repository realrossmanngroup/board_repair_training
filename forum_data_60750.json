All seems like it should be good there. I can't get ASD to run nor will it boot up in AHT. It will boot into windows from external drive."

ASD OS may encounter the same issue booting as macOS.\nmacOS typically won't boot if there's an Intel ME issue, while Linux or Windows will work perfectly fine. Under Windows' Device Manager you might see an issue with Intel ME.\nYou could try a clean ME, or even a full known good dump with clean ME. Additionally the ME Disable Strap can be an issue in some rare cases."
