I read an older post you had suggested LVDS even though they had 49v on backlight where in my case the backlight was working but no image. I guess they damaged something on the LVDS even though under the scope I cannot see anything inside or on the pins that would cause it. \n\nThank you Duke from the past and Duke of now ;)"
