        "message":"Hello,\nI have this board which had originally a short on PP3V42_G3H. I injected 3.4V on L6995, put alcohol everywhere and found an issue with U6400. For the moment I only removed L6400, I don't have a spare to replace U6400 yet.\nNow the board boots, internal display is ok, but very very slow to boot and to work. No battery installed. Activity monitor shows 89% used by the system.\nIn safe mode: same story, even more slow if possible, Activity monitor shows 95% used by the system.\nPRAM reset: no changes\nASD OS: Passed\nASD EFI: Passed\nI am almost sure that at a given moment with some SSD I saw kernel_task above 600%, but I am not able to reproduce that.\nHardware monitor: does not show high temperatures, fan is always around 2000rpm\nI swapped memory, SSD, same story.\nWhat could I do next?"
