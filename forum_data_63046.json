I can't see why not? \n\nI really struggle replacing some of these tiny components using an iron with others in close proximity, and can't use hot air so close to the plastic of the lcd connector,   do you use hot tweezers? What's the best method for replacing or swapping out these tiny smd components from the donor boards? \n\nI find they stick to my tweezers and it's a nightmare!?"
