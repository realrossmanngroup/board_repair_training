But the mb is showing low battery logo on the screen after pressing the power botton. \nI discovered that f7005 is out, I replace it and it blew again after Pluged in charger. \nI removed u7100 and replace another fuse. \nthe orange light came on, I installed another u7100 from a donor board, the orange light came on and q7130 started getting very hot. \nI removed u7100, Q7130 stopped getting hot.\npls what can I do next.
