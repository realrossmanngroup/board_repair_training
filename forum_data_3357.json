        "message":"My first post so be gentle.\n\n15\" MBP Retina (late 2012)... water damage took out the I\/O Board (melted the I\/O cable). Removed cable and board. Also killed the SSD (wouldn't boot from another Retina). Localized corrosion removed. Applied power and attempted boot from external usb hdd. Dies after 3-5 seconds of power. Reset SMC and PRAM. Fans now on high, but still dies after 3-5 seconds. Ran Apple HW test. Shows \"no problems with the logic board.\"\n\nHuh?\n\nWon't boot to Safe Mode.\n\nStarts booting to Recovery but as soon as it looks for a place to install, total shutdown executes.\n\nMy brain says SMC. Will SMC operate as normal with no I\/O board? Waiting for a replacement board and cable.\n\nMany thanks to all kind responses."

Initially removed the board and everything seemed to be working after a cursory cleaning but then it started spontaneously powering off after reading on the internal SSD for about 2 minutes.  Then the SSD completely self-destructed and I removed it.  That's why tried to boot it off the external.  I haven't applied power since the external died after 4 seconds."
