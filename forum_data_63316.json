I have green light, but no fan spin, and it only pulls 0.15A on bench PSU.\n\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.382V\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.59V\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.310V\nPP1V1R1V05_S5 = 1.0V\nPP18V5_G3H = 19.9V (using 20V on PSU)\nPP1V5_S3 = 0V\nPP5V_S3 = 0V\n\nI think L7560 is shorted (0.008 diode reading), but I'm not sure...\n\nCan you help?"
