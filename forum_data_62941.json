        "message":"Hello,\n\nThank you for your help today! I was tinkering with a trashed 2017 15\" MBP i7 2.8GHz 256GB Radeon 555 and I accidentally popped off a component.\n\nIn my research, I found the schematics for the board and I think I can identify it as C7052 \/ PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG.\n\nI have pointed to it with a red arrow (and red box) in the image attached.\n\nThe unit still powers on - and I don't notice any issues. However, how \"dangerous\" might it be to run the machine without this? Is this something that can be replaced?\n\nThanks!"
