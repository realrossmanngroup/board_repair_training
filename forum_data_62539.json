        "message":"This was at first intermittent but it now consistently is not charging. This board boots and runs normal otherwise on charger only, or battery connected. I've tried with and without BIL connected. SCL\/SDA diode readings look good at .522 and .518. resistance pins 17\/18 and 27\/28 are good. Diode readings on those same pins check out with FlexBV. \n\nI've changed SMC and U7000 (couple times changed U7000). R5280\/1 are good. Tried pulling D6950 to see if affected diode readings and no. R7000 is zero. SMC Lid is 3.3 with BIL connected. Changed out the DCIN. I'm at a loss for things to try!!!! Tried known good battery also.\n\nIn OS it detects battery says its normal but not charging. Shows capacity at 6800 and symbol at top looks like its charging. I tested with genuine apple 85w and tried a second one also."
