At this point it would require multiple SMC reset before I can boot up again. Tried reflashing efi chip with clean bios file using CMIZapper medusa 2 and it keeps giving me an error during the flash process. Errors are never the same. When I attempted cleaning the me region, it errors out because it can?t clean the me region. \n\nI went ahead and purchased another already flashed efi chip with the same outcome."
