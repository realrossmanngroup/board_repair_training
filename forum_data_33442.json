Came from another shop, found some components knocked off and replaced them(C7981 - CPUVCCIOS0_EN, D5802 \u2013 PP18v5_S5_R, and C4520 \u2013 SATA_ODD_R2D_C_N)\nI get green light, charges battery(amber), smc reset functions. No fan spin or power. Any ideas? 18v5_s5 missing, S3 rails missing. Does 18v5_s5 supply 5v_s3? Or vice versa?\nP3v42 = 3.445v\nPpbus g3h = 12.54v\nHS_S5_other = 12.54v\nSMC_RESET_L = 3.39v\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN = 3.42v\nPp18v5_s5\/R = 0v\n3v3_s5 = 3.3v; _s4 = 3.3v; _s3 = 0v\nPp5v_s5 = 5v; _s3 = 0v\nSMC_BC_ACOK_VCC = 3.43v\n\nAny ideas where to start?\n\nEDIT: No PM_SLP_S5_L"
