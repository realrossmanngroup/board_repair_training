        "message":"Got this one in today a1708  820-00840-A .\n\nI was told it stopped working after a drink was spilled on it. \n\nNever been opened before so I'm the first person to ever crack this open. \n\nA few small signs of liquid ingress ( Coke, coffee or something brown and sticky ) around the wifi card and just behind the usb-c ports .\n\nMust have been recent as it all cleaned up real easy and is now spotless and also bottom of the board whole logic board now looks like new! \n\nIt draws a solid 20v and normal amps with the battery connected and disconnected.\n\non power on I get fan spin and trackpad click and also feel the CPU getting warm but no boot sound and no display on screen or external monitor whatsoever, \n\nI popped a usb stick into both ports and it lights up and flickers briefly  ( I presume this is how we test for usb activity? )\n\nadvice on where to go from here much appreciated."

( A sign of life! )  I presumed it was sorted. so disconnected external drive and put back internal SSD, same thing no display, Tried again to remove SSD and do PRAM - multiple times and connected external HD  to try to reproduce the screen coming on again  but I couldn't .. still dead \/ no display,.\n\nChecked CPU core at L7210  = 0.65v\n\nI also tried dropping the logic board into a known good donor machine with working screen & keyboard, battery and trackpad, exact same behaviour"
