        "message":"Hi there,\nI am glad to be a member of this community and here is my first post :)\n\nI managed to fix a 820-3437 Board by removing a short to ground on PP3V42.\nI had to replace some Caps getting very hot when I was injecting 3.4V with my bench power supply.\n\nFurthermore i had to replace the Con-Board flex cable. The pins where burned to dust!\n\nAfter all that the fan went on - off - on - off - on - off - on and finally it remains on and everything seems to work and my work were done right? Not really :)\n\nASD reports PPBUS is too low and I measure 7.6V on the whole rail. I don\u00b4t think something is shorting to ground since nothing gets really hot.\nFurthermore all the resistors in the ISL6259 area measure good values...\n\nSo what did you think about this problem?\nShould I follow the rabbit or leave the machine as is?\n\n--> The customer has his machine already back for data backup since the machine works and he knows about the issue and he will report unusual behavior."

        "message":"No Title\n\nThank You for the reply\nQ5500 was the first place i looked at - I forgot to mention it\nEverything measures and looks fine \n\nI attached a picture so you don't need to search it your self\nPPBUS_G3H on the left side is already 7.6V so the outgoing signal on PIN 3 is also 7.6V\n\nThe outgoing signal SMC_PBUS_VSENSE on the right side is created from PIN3 of Q5500 and the voltage divider R5503\/ R5504 -  all measures fine\nSo for me this section was OK and I went on.\n\nMy guess is there is no sensor issue but the real  value of PBUS is\/was indeed too low! \nWhich raises the question on why PBUS is\/was too low?\n\nMaybe you're right and 7.6V is fine for a not fully charged battery and I will run ASD with a charged battery again when I get my hands on it!\n\nI will report back"
