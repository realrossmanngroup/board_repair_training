        "message":"[ATTACH type=\"full\"]61097[\/ATTACH]\nHello everyone,\nJust want to be sure, if I want to change this ram config from 8gb to 16gb do I need to remove the other resistors and keep only ramcfg4, ramcfg3 and ramcfg0.\nAnd one more question about ram chips can we say all ram chips works on all boards, or is there any trick or important detail I need to always check?\nThank You"
