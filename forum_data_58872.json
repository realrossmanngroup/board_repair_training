        "message":"Hello, for a project I decided to take on an 820-2610. It started as not turning on and having like .08V on PPBUS_G3H. after tracing from DC in I found that R6905 was burned up. I replaced it with a similar resistor and the board power up and showed a flashing ? folder. Well I left it on for about 10 min and I hear a 'pop' sound. I looked at R6905 and it blew in half again. it got so hot the solder actually melted and the two halves of the resistor were standing on end. Before I dive headfirst into this sure to be rabbit hole, I wanted to ask the hive mind if there is a specific culprit for why the resistor blew in such a spectacular fashion. I also wanted to note that I am using an original MS1."
