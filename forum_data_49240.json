        "message":"Hello,\nI have an iMac 21.5 \"A1311 EMC 2428 from 2011.\nI already changed the hard drive on it.\nI have a backlight problem, I have a dark display on the internal screen, on an external screen no worries.\nBefore I had the screen blinking, the brightness only varied.\nI bought a new backlight power supply (inverter) and now I have no backlight at all.\nWhen I measure the input current of the card \/ output of the power supply for the inverter, I have nothing.\nThe power works well, but does not give any power to the inverter it seems.\nBy the way I had returned the card and bought another but the same.\nI measured the current without the screen plugged in, but anyway I guess the power supply delivers the connected screen current or not.\nThank you in advance."
