        "message":"Hello guys. This is a third party repair for another store that I'm doing here. The board has been UC on the other store before coming here, so probably it got liquid damaged and that's why they cleaned it. The symptom is that the machine works without battery, charger goes green\/orange and works well. As soon as I plug in the battery it dies. No light on charger and the charger itself gets disabled by the board and only works again if I unplug and plug it in the wall again without battery connected. Verified R7151\/7152 and both are ok. Replaced ISL and reballed SMC. Same results. What else can I check?"
