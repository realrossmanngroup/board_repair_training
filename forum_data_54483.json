        "message":"Customer brought in a 2019 15\" MacBook Pro Touch bar with some coffee damage. Makes charger ding when plugged in but shows nothing on internal or external screen. Upon further inspection it looks to not be making it to an s0 state as cpu and gpu are ice cold and has no vcore. I know i have at least ppbus_g3h and pp5v_S5 Only signs of liquid on the board on on the right side near touch bar connector. This is the first T2 board i've worked on."
