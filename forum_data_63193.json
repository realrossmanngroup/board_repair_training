This net is going only to U4900 and U1400 and both are BGA's. I'm using OpenBoardView and this SW doesn't shows vias so I can't probe this net on via either.\n\nI haven't tried another DCIN board. I can order one and try it, but since the input voltage looks good, I'm guessing the DCIN board is good."
