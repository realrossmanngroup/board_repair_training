        "message":"So i've got an 820-4924-A which won't charge when using original charger. The light won't come on the charger there is no voltage at J7000 and it's not charging. I've tried a different charging socket (known good in another macbook) which also doesn't work. If I use a chinese charger the green light appears and the machine powers up and works, charges fully no issues. \nI'm wondering what the issue could be maybe u7000\/u7001? Can't see any liquid damage on this board it's clean"
