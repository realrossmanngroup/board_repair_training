        "message":"Hello,\nI have an 820-2936 that I attempted to flash firmware to with clean ME region. I used the apple 1.5MB ME version 7 since a tool indicated that the stock rom had ME series 7.\nI flashed the ROM and it successfully writes and verifies, but when I turn the machine on it beeps SOS. Literally 3 short beeps 3 long beeps, and 3 short beeps.\nAnyone have this issue before? Is ME series 7 correct for this machine? \n\nThanks,\n\nStefan\nPS - This is for a school system that somewhow locked themselves out of 3 different computers with JAMF software. I fixed 2 macbook airs using this procedure - read clean efi from same model, insert clean me region, change serial #, and flash back."
