Got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> here that got fried by knockoff charger. <CHIP>ISL6269</CHIP> was fried, <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> also fried. SMC is fried like KFC. I replaced ISL, replaced both mosfets and verified all current sensing resistors near ISL. Also replaced <DIODE>D6990</DIODE>, <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> as they looked suspicious. At the present moment I got SMC out of the board and am working on establishing at least 12.24V on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> line. My readings are as follows:\n\nGot 16.5V from charger DCIN\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> varies from 0.3V to 2V after some time charger is connected, if I heat up <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> I get immediately 12.24V on L7030 and steady 3.3V on L6995. I'm stuck now. Tried injecting 12.5V on L7030, I get a sparkle but it does not drain any current from my PSU. Any ideas on what to look?"
