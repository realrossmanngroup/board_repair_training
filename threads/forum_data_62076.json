        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",

        "C4811": "What is C4811? a CAPACITOR.",
        "5V_S0": "What is 5V_S0? 5V_S5 is an abbreviation for “PP5V_S0”.",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

        "EDP_BKLT_PWM": "What is EDP_BKLT_PWM? EDP_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created..",
        "I2C_BKLT": "What is I2C_BKLT? I2C_BKLT is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",
        "BKLT_SDA": "What is BKLT_SDA? BKLT_SDA is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",

            "message": "This 2017 MacBook Pro board came with a dark screen and liquid damage in the backlight circuity area. I found a shorted cap (<CAPACITOR>C4811</CAPACITOR>) which I replaced. The backlight came on for a few days, then died again. I've replaced <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> and checked all resistors and traces in that area. Machine boots and backlight enable signal is present. Still no backlight.\n\nThen I found that <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>, which supplies <CHIP>U8400</CHIP>, has a low resistance to ground (95 ohms; 0.09 V in diode mode); a good board shows 5+ kohms on this rail. I'm having a hard time figuring out where this partial short is located, since injecting 5 V only gets 0.1 A flowing and nothing heats up. Any way to pinpoint the culprit?"
