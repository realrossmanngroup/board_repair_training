No change.\n\nP5V_S0 and PP3V3_S0 are stable. I checked LED_RETURN_1; it has connectivity to U7701.\n\nLVDS connector looks pristine, inside as well as outside. Pins are all properly fixed in place. \n\nAre these LED_RETURN voltages normal? Whats next? replace U7701 again with lower heat to make sure its not messed up?"
