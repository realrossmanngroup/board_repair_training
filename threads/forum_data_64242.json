            "message": "Hello,\ni am working on this old device for a person i know. The board works perfectly find except it mostly wont wake from sleep. I cant figure out what causes this but really rarely it did wake up until it got rebooted (observed this only 2 times). Lid did not need to be closed for this to happen. If i let it sit and its going to sleep on its own and than press a key to wake it up (even power button) it spins the fan on but not more. No Backlight, image, USB-activity,.... Closing and opening the lid did not change that. If i hard reset it (hold power for 8 sec.) and boot it up again it boots into the last open session (must save that to my SSD i guess and think it just woke up...) I tested Snow Leopard, Mavericks and El Capitan, internally and via USB. No change. <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.3V open, 0V closed. <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> is not coming up if it wont wake up. I checked power rails in that state aswell as some signals armoud the MISC section of the MCP that creats <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> but everything seems to be fine as far as i can tell. Also i am not sure which signals are interesting/needed in this case. ASD drops sleep-sensor issue. Same with J6955 unplugged. Not sure where to go from here."
