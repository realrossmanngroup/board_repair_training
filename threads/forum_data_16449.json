After I replaced it, it doesn't boot anymore. I'm guessing I fried the CPU, which is right on the other side of the board. Any suggestions?\n\nCheers, Rick"}

There is no golden tip for this. Also a dead U5800 never happens, usually something else on the data bus is messing things up. Corrosion on connectors and SMC are the most likely."}
