I cleaned with with isopropyl alcohol. I measured all 16 terminator resistors and they are fine. The only issue I can find (besides the voltages) is Pin 2 on <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> (<SIGNAL>SPI_MLB_MISO</SIGNAL>), does not have continuity with <RESISTOR>R6114</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R6123</RESISTOR> or it’s VIA (824). My questions are… [LIST=1]\n[*]Should I be getting continuity from those locations? If so, is re-soldering the chip/replacing is my next step? I know it’s a BIOS chip, so it’s not a simple rip and replace.\n[*]Is 15.13 too far out of tolerance for <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3</SIGNAL> which should be 18.5?\n[*]If I understood Louis's Rossmann Repair Training Guide correctly, should all of the rails be pulsing?\n[*]Any other suggestions as to what I should look into?\n[/LIST]\n\nPS: PS:32 > IS:24 > Wagner 08 :)"
