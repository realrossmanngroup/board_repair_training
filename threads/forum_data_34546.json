If it freezes it still shows a picture but i cant type anything nor move the mouse. Same if i boot from an external drive. Power Button can still turn it off. I already resoldered the joints on <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> but no change. Can a reflow or new IC help i this case? Or is it a different problem this time? I remeber from one of Louis´s streams that there also is an issue where the CPU clocks down so far that the device crashes... Could it be that?"
