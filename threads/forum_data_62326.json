        "message":"Hi all,\n\njust wanted to get some assistance on another 820-01598 I bought last week. Boards spotless no liquid damage everything looks pristine. Boards stuck at 5v 0.0180A pretty consistently on both ports. Battery removed, don\u2019t have a known good as this did not come with one and my ones fully depleted and quite old. PPbus at the fuse is 12.25v steady not fluctuating. Removed the fuse and checked on both sides for a short and got .4 on both sides or millions of ohms on both sides. How fussy should I be on the pPbus value? I believe it should be 12.5v but aren\u2019t sure what the tolerance of that is.\n\nI did notice the TPS62180 looked a bit discoloured and it was getting slightly warm so I took it off. Balls on the bottom row look really dark like they\u2019ve been carrying way too much current and there a bit smaller than the others. Checked diode mode on all its pins and everything seems normal, nothing below .4 other than ground obviously. We are getting Vin on all the pins, but the bottom line directly underneath the 4 vin pins in the schematic is missing. Sorry don\u2019t have the schematic with me so can\u2019t give it it\u2019s correct name.\n\nAre the TPS62180 common failures? I know the tps die quite frequently on the a1466s.\n\nthanks."

        "message":"Thanks for the clarification on pPbus. I was worried about that, T2 likely being bad. No voltage at c6912 was not present. \n\nBTW P3v3g3hrtc_ss was the line I was referring to in my above post where I mentioned I didn\u2019t have the schematic with me so I couldn\u2019t post the correct name. That\u2019s not required is it for the TPS to do it\u2019s job? I believe chgr_en_mvr_r is the enable line for the tps is that correct? That was also present (steady 5v ) before removing the tps and just re measured and still is. So it definitely does look like the TPS is bad. Both enable and Vin are present. PPBUS being the wrong voltage does worry me though, the tps should not effect that should it?\n\nI\u2019ve ordered some replacement TPS off Ali express since everyone else has no stock but they won\u2019t be here till mid March apparently. I wish someone in Australia would stock these things, it\u2019s so painful having to wait a month to see if this solves your issue. The previous 820-01598 I had I ended up no fixing and donated it to a local shop who also couldn\u2019t fix it, they said there 99% sure the T2 is dead so they used it as parts so I don\u2019t have any donors to steal it off. Only donors I have are a1466s."

I removed it and found the CHGR_CSO_P pad 4 had been burned away leaving a slight crater.\n\n I replaced the pad with the relife pad repair kits and soldered the trace to pin 2 of c7020.
