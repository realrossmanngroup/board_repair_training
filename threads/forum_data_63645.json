Probably one of my test screens is problematic as after connecting it I lost the internal picture, tested other screens still same.\nTorch shine through it, to check if its only BL but cant see anything.\n\nIt turns on and chimes, capslock is responding but no internal picture. External works with disconnected LCD.\n\nIt must be related to LVDS, as happened when testing screens. LVDS has no damage. Where to check first? Tried PRAM reset, SMC reset. LCD matrix usually turns black, this one doesn't seem to turn black at all.\n\n20V 0.345A with connected different test lcd\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> - 5.15V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL> - 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_ALSCAM_F</SIGNAL> - 5.15V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL> - 0V\n<SIGNAL>PANEL_P5V_EN</SIGNAL> - 0V\n\n<CHIP>U8510</CHIP>\n<SIGNAL>PANEL_FET_EN_DLY</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> - 0V\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"1677489209886.png\"]61012[/ATTACH]\nThis U501, <RESISTOR>R5351</RESISTOR>, and CC728  area looks a bit weird, but I think it's flux. Dont see any liquid damage anywhere.\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"1677489301410.png\"]61013[/ATTACH]\nThe only anomaly is this area on the backlight cover which seemed ripped off when fitting in the factory and perhaps introduced something through 8,9,0 keys."
