Normally I ultrasonic it, then put it in alcohol bath for a minute or 2 and then air dry it with paper towel for about a minute. Optimally, an oven would be good but I would use a heat gun on low to dry alcohol quickly then used canned air to blow out alcohol under BGA chips and never had an issue with it firing up after that"}
