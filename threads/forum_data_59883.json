        "SPI_CLK": "What is SPI_CLK? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PP15V_TBT": "What is PP15V_TBT? a SIGNAL.",
        "DEW_PWRGD": "What is DEW_PWRGD? a SIGNAL.",
        "R6121": "What is R6121? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",
        "PCH_INTRUDER_L": "What is PCH_INTRUDER_L? PCH_INTRUDER_L is a signal that tells the machine the case has been opened by an intruder when it is low, the _L means it is present when it is low. This signal should always be high in a Macbook since it doesnâ€™t use intrusion detection. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",
        "PCH_INTVRMEN": "What is PCH_INTVRMEN? PCH_INTVRMEN is an Internal Voltage Regulator Enable: When pulled high, this signal enables\nthe internal 1.05 V regulators for the Suspend well in the PCH. This signal must\nremain asserted for the VRMs to behave properly (no glitches allowed).\nThis signal must be pulled-up to VCCRTC on desktop platforms and may\noptionally be pulled low on mobile platforms if using an external VR for the\nVCCSUS rail.",

        "S5_L": "What is S5_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "CPU_VCCST_PWRGD": "What is CPU_VCCST_PWRGD? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off.."
