Basically the machine can not install Ventura update. \nEverything works fine if I install Catalina or Big Sur. When I try to update to Ventura the machine or doesn't make the loading bar start, or fan spin for a sec at max spin and switch himself off and restarts. \n\nI tryed to DFU restore and works all the time. But as soon I go with Ventura install the issues start. \nCustomer needs the latest OS available. \nAny solutions?"}
