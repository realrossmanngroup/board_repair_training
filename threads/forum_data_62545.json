S5 rails appear to be present, but S4 PP3V3 rails I keep coming back to. \n<CHIP>U3210</CHIP> I also keep coming back to. \nHere are the voltages\n<CHIP>U3210</CHIP> pins 6/7/12/14/18/5/11/17, but pins 19/20 both show 3.3v.\nMagsafe charger is lit up and does go from green to amber when plugged in and battery disconnected.\nAt first I could not perform a SMC reset but I found another Mac with a keyboard and I was able to reset the SMC successfully.\nAny idea where I can go next for this? Is <CHIP>U3210</CHIP> the issue here? \nThank you."
