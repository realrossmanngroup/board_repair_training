S5 rails appear to be present, but S4 PP3V3 rails I keep coming back to. \nU3210 I also keep coming back to. \nHere are the voltages\nU3210 pins 6\/7\/12\/14\/18\/5\/11\/17, but pins 19\/20 both show 3.3v.\nMagsafe charger is lit up and does go from green to amber when plugged in and battery disconnected.\nAt first I could not perform a SMC reset but I found another Mac with a keyboard and I was able to reset the SMC successfully.\nAny idea where I can go next for this? Is U3210 the issue here? \nThank you."}
