            "message": "Hello. Got this board here. Board is completely clean, no corrosion at all. Fan spins, I get 1v05 and 1.8V at CPU VCORE, no chime, no POST. Fan spins at max after some time, CPU gets warm. Tried reballing SMC, no luck, tried new BIOS, no luck, verified all SPI resistors and all read ok. No visible broken traces, as I told, board is really clean, no corrosion in any regions. Tried also heating PCH/CPU with Amtech flux with hot air station at 320 degrees for 20 to 30 seconds to make the flux flow under the chip and board is the same. Diode mode on L7630 is 0.126 and I have steady 1.05V on it. Any ideas?"
