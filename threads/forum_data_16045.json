(SMC_BC_ACOK = 3.11V)\n- When I connect a charged battery no light in charger but runs fine from battery. Not charging off course (SMC_BC_ACOK = ~200mV)"}

The light turns off because if the machine sent 16v to your 8v battery it would explode. Believe it or not PPBUS_G3H can go from 8 to 16 with no system damage, all downstream power rails are designed to adapt and adjust their switching frequency accordingly.\n\nCheck it!"}

If I now take out the charger and plug it again then no light and no charging."}
