        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "SMC_ON": "What is SMC_ON? a SIGNAL.",
        "OFF_L": "What is OFF_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "R1905": "What is R1905? a RESISTOR.",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "A1278": "What is A1278? A1278 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook or Macbook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2254, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2327, 820-2530, 820-2879, 820-2936, 820-3115.."

            "message": "hi Guys,\nI'm having a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3476</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that is having strange problem. everything of the machine works when it powers on EXCEPT it can't power on from keyboard.\nit only can turn on when you connect the charger( the automatic turn on thing) . and yes I checked the keyboard, and tried with another known good one already. sure it's not the issue with the keyboard.\n\nso far I checked\n1.<SIGNAL>SMC_ON</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>OFF_L</SIGNAL> 3.4v  ,when power button is pressed, it drops and back to 3.4,which should be normal\n2. checked <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL>, same story as <SIGNAL>SMC_ON</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>OFF_L</SIGNAL>\n\nand like to mention, when the machine powers on, after you click shut down in the OS, it shuts down. then there is no way you can press power button to turn on again. only way to power on again is to disconnect the charger and battery, then reconnect the charger to let it power on automatically.\n\nchecked around the board, can't see spill or anything, just one single point with a bit green stuff that can tell what it is, but i did solder it to good condition again already,it's pin 1 on <RESISTOR>R1905</RESISTOR>, after that i checked the conductivity and it's good. so it probably has nothing to do with the problem.but still like to mention.\n\nany advice would be appreciated!"

            "message": "<SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER_EN</SIGNAL> is low, i think that's the cause?\nwhen standby and no power on, the voltage would change from 1.0-1.7,it's changing when you mesure\nwhen it's on, it's 0.2-0.5\n\nIt looks like it only goes to two place ,the CPU and the SMC. can you explain a bit what does the signal does and can we modify the circuit to make it work rather than replacing the SMC?\nfrom what it says,it should be a signal to enable the adapter? but we have 3v42 and one wire is all good ,why we need that to \"enable\" the adapter?\n\nthanks!"
