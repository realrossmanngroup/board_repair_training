Internet recovery when I get to the wifi selection, it finds the wifi, but I enter the password and it just spins, never connects. I was able to do a successful restore and revive. The fan spun up only once afte completing a revive, but other then that, the fan does not seem to spin, so this seems like a sensor issue to me?\n\nBoard had liquid damage and the touch bar connector J5110 got burned at some point. I have not replaced this connector or plugged anything in to it. The battery was bad but I replaced this with a good working one. [U]I am confused where else I should be looking.[/U] I have cleaned up the liquid damage."
