All I have seen from it is when switching on you get the apple symbol, then a loading bar, then a progress wheel. The loading bar goes about half way then it goes off screen, progress wheel stays there with apple symbol then the thing switches off, the screen it gives is attached to this post. When switching on again, it does the same thing. \nTrying to load an internet restore from switching on then command and r gives the padlock symbol on screen and it wants a password. I don't know the password, but the owner has tried their own password and it does not move on. I am told they bought it from Groupon so my thinking is, the computer was refurbished and used to belong to someone else so it wants the original password it maybe first had when it was brand  new. \nI am thinking getting round this by changing the password if possible and in older macs I have got round the password problem by changing the amount of ram which allows you passed the password problem that then lets you restore the computer or reset the password.  I did that on a MacBook Pro of my own some years ago, but it from a 17 inch version from about 2006\/2007. Has anyone seen this issue before or know a way round it.\nA different hard drive has also been tried which didn't change anything.\nThanks for reading"}

When trying to switch on from battery only the cpu fans spins for maybe 2 seconds then stops. The power light comes on in that time and then goes off when the fan stops. When connecting to power, the fans starts to spin for 2 seconds, then stops and starts again. Still will not switch on. I tried a p tram reset just in case and nothing happens so it isn't switching on. When power is connected, the light on the connector lights up green then goes red. Has something gone wrong with the programming or am I diagnosing a power problem?"}
