Tested with another display and still same.\nIf I leave the battery connected it turns on and all voltages are present but keep looping every 20 secs.\nWithout a battery the voltages 20V, 0.0465Amps, 0.950W.\nL7600 - PP5V_G3S - 5.13V\nL7660 - PP3V3_G3H_T - 3.35V\nF7001 - PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG - 12.6V\nNo other coil has voltage.\n\nBut, if the battery is connected the voltages seams normally everywhere for 20 secs, then keep looping.\nThe voltage on the Amp meter with battery is like 20V always, amps go to 2.2 and drop to o.4\n\n[URL='https:\/\/youtu.be\/jM_VlhctK14']Link for the video showing the power cycling on Amp Meter[\/URL]"
