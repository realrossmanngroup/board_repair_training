It was quite dirty so I ultrasoniced it first. Now the mac chimes and boots showing the apple logo. Then a vertical short line appears in the bottom and the apple logo is gone. The mac is still running though, and the backlight is tumed on. Any ideas? Apple ASD test says battery needs replacement but this is a new battery working fine in another Mac. Also got green and orange light on the macsafe. External display is not running.\n\nHave a good weekend!"}

I usually pull back a bit before running through the cleaner and use a brush after. Also, I\u2019ve noticed they can catch debris from the cleaner.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b"}
