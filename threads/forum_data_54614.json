It was preventing 20v on the charger!  After disconnecting it the machine boots!\nProblem is how do I replace it?  Will apple fix it?  Maybe if I disconnect it and give it to them they will replace it.  I am sure when they connect it they will find out it keeps the machine from booting.  What can I do?\n\nCheck out my YouTube video to see the details.\n\n[url]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WgLGLAVSlHQ[\/url]"}

I decided to soak the touch ID button in a Zinc Choride solution for about 10 minutes the power wash it out with a water pick.  That did the trick.  I was able to save the Touch ID button and the machine works.  I posted multiple videos on this as I was repairing the machine on my channel.  \n\nWant to thank who ever made Rubyfluid.  it is amazing stuff."}
