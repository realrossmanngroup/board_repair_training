Everything seems to work well except the back left USB-C port does not charge the battery or power the computer, though it works fine as a data port.\nThe other 3 USB-C ports take a charge and operate normally.\n\nI'm assuming this has something to do with the <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS</SIGNAL>?\nI've checked the bank of relevant caps around it and resistance seems fine. tried another I/O board, no change.\n\nAny idea what the usual suspects are for USB-C charging issues?\n\nMany Thanks"
