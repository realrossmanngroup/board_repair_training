        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

If it isn't fixed, do not pass go, you know what to do..\n\n2) How shitty do pins 1, 19, and 21 look on J9500?\n\n3) How shitty does the flex cable between the dc in board and the logic board look?\n\n4) Have you tried a known working DC in board & known good 821-1722 flex cable?\n\n\nLook at what <CHIP>U6901</CHIP> and <CHIP>U6900</CHIP> look like on any <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> from 2010-present or any <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1286</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> from 2010 to the present... now look at the air dc in board.
