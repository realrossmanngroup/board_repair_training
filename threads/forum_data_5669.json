C7094 was missing i put another cap im getting PP3V42_G3H also SMC_BC_ACOK is present and SMC_RESET_L is 3.3v  i think all signals are present for the computer to get green light bu i don't have green light. At some point while C7094 was missing i got green light but board wouldn't turn on after i put the C7094 i lost the green light also the Voltage that im getting is 7.3V that's P3V42G3H_BOOST, also the via for P3V42G3H_BOOST was damaged from pin 3 of  U7090  to pin 1 of C7094. Any ideas???"}

If something is broken, FIX IT!!! If it isn't fixed, do not pass go, you know what to do..\n\n2) How shitty do pins 1, 19, and 21 look on J9500?\n\n3) How shitty does the flex cable between the dc in board and the logic board look?\n\n4) Have you tried a known working DC in board & known good 821-1722 flex cable?\n\n\nLook at what U6901 and U6900 look like on any A1278 from 2010-present or any A1286 from 2010 to the present... now look at the air dc in board. Notice how it uses the same onewire circuit? You can measure on the dc in board and see if PP3V42_G3H and SMC_BC_ACOK are making their way over to the dc in board like they should be."}
