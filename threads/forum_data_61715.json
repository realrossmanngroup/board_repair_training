        "message":"This arrived with no liquid damage but one of the left usb-c ports was burnt. Replaced usb-c connector. Worked only one day for customer but then came back with all of the ports not working and machine no longer powering on\n\nNo damage on board, looks pristine. At first board was stuck at 5v and intermittently went to 20v with intermittent charging.\n\nRestored T2 firmware via DFU to rule out. Seemed to fix for a few hours but same issue returned.\n\nNow  when its plugged in its drawing 20V and 0amp draw\n\nWhat should be checked next?"
