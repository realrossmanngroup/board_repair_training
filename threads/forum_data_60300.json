Here are some of the voltages I have been looking at:\n\n20 volts at the charger and cycling between 0.00 - 0.04 amps.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.6\nPP3V3_G3H = 3.3 volts\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC = 3.3 volts\nPP5V_G3S = 0 volts\nPP1V8_G3S = 0 volts\nPP1V8_SLPS2R = 1.8 volts\nPP1V1_SLPS2R = 1.1 volts\nPP0V8_SLPS2R = 0.8 volts\nPP1V2_AWAKE = 1.2 volts\nPP3V3_S5 = 0.44 volts *****\nPP3V3_AWAKE = 0 volts\n\nWhat should I check next?\n\nI just realized G3S voltages missing typing this out.."
