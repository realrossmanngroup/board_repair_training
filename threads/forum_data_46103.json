Reflowed <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> as per Duke's advice in another thread. Battery immediately displayed correct voltage.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> on Charger without Battery: 12.59v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> on charger WITH battery: starts at like 11.5v and climbs up.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> without Charger and ONLY battery: 11.1v\n\nThe computer now runs off the battery, shows a percentage too. However the percentage jumps around a bit.\n\nMy question is, does <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> being not even 12v while on the battery indicate that there is something else wrong? Or should I call this done?\n\nThanks!"
