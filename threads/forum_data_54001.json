        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off.."

There is no liquid damage or corrosion...\nWhen the board is cold (room temperature), <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> & <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> is missing. (No short to GND) <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is present.\nAs soon as i heat the board up ever so slightly with hot air & & plug in the magsafe i get Fan-Spin & <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> & <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> are 3.3v.\nI put the machine back together & everything works fine, until i shut it down & next morning when its cooled down i have same issue...\nI managed to be able to replicate the problem quicker by placing the board in a fridge for a minute or so, & as soon as i heat it up it will be fine.\nAlso its hard to tell what specific part of the board is the culprit...\n\nI am very confused."
