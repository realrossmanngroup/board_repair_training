There is no liquid damage or corrosion...\nWhen the board is cold (room temperature), PP3V3_S4 & PM_SLP_S4_L is missing. (No short to GND) PP3V3_S5 is present.\nAs soon as i heat the board up ever so slightly with hot air & & plug in the magsafe i get Fan-Spin & PM_SLP_S4_L & PP3v3_S4 are 3.3v.\nI put the machine back together & everything works fine, until i shut it down & next morning when its cooled down i have same issue...\nI managed to be able to replicate the problem quicker by placing the board in a fridge for a minute or so, & as soon as i heat it up it will be fine.\nAlso its hard to tell what specific part of the board is the culprit...\n\nI am very confused."}
