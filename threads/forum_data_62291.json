        "message":"Hi there. I just replaced the display on an A1706 (2016 13\" Touchbar) and after installation, the machine would not boot up fully (20V @ 200-400mA, no image, no chime) Inspection using thermal camera indicated U7600 was getting hot. I proceeded to remove the board and test. I connected power and the unit booted up, and u7600 remained normal temp. I then connected a display and got a boot screen. I then reinstalled the board and connected all cables. The machine booted up, yet there is no trackpad or keyboard. Keyboard backlight is functional, so is touchbar. I measured voltages to trackpad and they seemed normal:\n\nPP5V_S4=5.1V\nSMBUS_SMC_3_SDA=3.4V\nPP3V3_S4_TPAD=3.4V\n\nIf I disconnect the trackpad before booting the fans spin up full blast indicating that its not seeing a trackpad. Reconnecting and fans stay off as normal. I have tried three different trackpads, two different cables, and one other known good top case\/keyboard...and still no function. Its definitely a board issue.\n\nWhere do I go from here?"
