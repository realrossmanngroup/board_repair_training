            "message": "This board came with liquid damage on the ports side, the flex and the connector (port A portion) on the board were burned and shorting the 20V rail.\n\nI Replaced the flex and the connector on the board and the short went from the 20V rail. The laptop boots ans charges.\nHowever when charging the battery from port B, I noticed a burning hot <TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> I replaced it with one from <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> and no more issue.\n\nNow my issue is with the charger, it works only on one and same side on both usb-c ports. I tried another charger and the same thing.\n\nI think more of J3300 soldering. One raw corresponding to either the bottom side or the top side is probably not making contact. \nThis time, I wanted to try to solder the whole connector with it's gold brackets with hot air... Usually I disassemble first the gold brackets, I solder the inner pins and then I clip back the brackets and solder them...\n\nI may have to adapt the temperature and find what works well without melting J3300, otherwise I will just revert back to my first method.\n\nWhat method works well for you when soldering usb-c connectors?\n \nThanks!"
