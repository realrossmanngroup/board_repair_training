Actually if a wait a bit than the OSX will boot and i have backlight and picture, and the laptop works, except that now i cant adjust the brighntess at all, after PRAM reset. For a while the sleep sensor did not work, when i closed the lid it did not turn off the screen, after that i did the PRAM reset many times, and that is working now, but still no brightess adjustment, and when the laptop comes back from sleep there is no backlight at all, for that i have to restart it. \n\nIts 2010 model so maybe better to just leave it, but now its annoying i put some time in it."}
