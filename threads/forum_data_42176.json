        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS? This power rail is PPBUS_G3H after going through a current sense resistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H & the input of PPBUS_G3H to circuitry that provides power for the CPU..",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015."
