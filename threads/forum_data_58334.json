This was cleared after removing MOSFET <TRANSISTOR>Q7260</TRANSISTOR> which cleared the short. Replaced it with a donor and as soon as I gave it power it got very hot and PPBUS was shorted again. I checked out <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> and found it outputting 12V to a 5V line. Replaced it and the mosfet with another donor and no more short on PPBUS. Still won?t boot though. <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> has an Enable of 3.02V instead of normal 3.3 but it does have the supply of 12V. Is the low Enable a Problem? Anyone got any tips? Thanks!"
