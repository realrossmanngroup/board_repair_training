            "message": "Hi guys, I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with no light on the magsafe. Some small corrosion around <TRANSISTOR>Q6896</TRANSISTOR>. I check PPBUS as well as <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and they both have 0v, no shorts. If I check on F6905 i get 0.470v. Tried another Magsafe, and another charger but same. I know how to troubleshoot onewire, but that seems not the issue as I dont even have DC-IN power, or am I missing something? If i.e. <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> or <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> are not OK would the Mac not even get DC-IN power? All IC in charge circuit look good. Please enlighten me."
