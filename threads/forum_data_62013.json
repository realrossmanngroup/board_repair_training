It [I]sometimes[\/I] turns on after leaving it alone for a while (albeit doesn't boot, but that might be a separate problem).\n\nRight now, these are what I probed for (not in order). It shows 0.05A and 20V from the USB-C meter. I poured Alcohol on the board and it doesn't get [I]that[\/I] hot anywhere.\n[LIST]\n[*]PPBUS_G3H - 12.62V\n[*]PP3V3_S5 - 3.327V\n[*]SMC_PM_G2_EN - 3.42V\n[*]PP3V3_G3H - 3.42V\n[*]PP3V3_S4 - 0V\n[*]PP5V_S5 - 5.15V\n[*]PPBUS_HS_OTH3V3 - 12.62V\n[*]P5VS0_TG - 0V\n[*]P5VS0_VBST_R - 4.79V\n[*]P5VS4_SW - 0V\n[*]PM_EN_PVXS5 - 3.4V\n[*][B]P5VS5_PGOOD - 0V[\/B]\n[*]PM_SLP_SUS_L - 0V\n[*]S5_PWRGD - 0V 100Ohm to ground right after powering off but rises to 90k\n[*][B]P5VS4_PGOOD - 0V[\/B]\n[*]PP3V3_S5 - 5V\n[*]P3V3S5_SW - 3.3V\n[*][B]PM_EN_PVXS5 - 3.42V[\/B]\n[*][B]P3V3S5_EN_RCD - 3.3V[\/B]\n[*][B]P3V3S5_COMP2 - 1.96V[\/B]\n[\/LIST]\n\nI think the main problem is that S5_PWRGD is missing even though P3V3S5_EN_RCD, PM_EN_PVXS5, and PPBUS_HS_OTH3V3 is present. Does this mean I have to change U7650? I don't see any damage near there. I don't have an ultrasonic cleaner so would prefer to root-cause it before purchasing one.\n\nThank you!\nRohit"}
