    "definitions": {
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "PP1V2_S3": "What is PP1V2_S3? PP1V2_S3 is a 1.2v power rail present when the machine is in an S3 suspend to RAM state.",
        "PP3V3_S5_REG": "What is PP3V3_S5_REG? PP3V3_S5_REG is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H_REG": "What is PP3V42_G3H_REG? PP3V42_G3H_REG is another way to say PP3V42_G3H. PP3V42_G3H_REG and PP3V42_G3H are a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU_PH1": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU_PH1? a SIGNAL.",

It had some resistors <RESISTOR>R5177</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R5178</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R5179</RESISTOR> corroded, I changed them and it did not give video again, check resistors and they are well placed, I do not know when placing resistors affect the smc that are nearby.
