            "message": "Got this one here and it was not turning on. There was corrosion around <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> area and some missing resistors there. I managed to get the board working again after placing missing components and cleaning up the area. Machine is working ok, except when I connect power to left USB-C port nearest the trackpad. When I connect power there, the area around <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> heats so much that cooler kicks in full blast and to the point even turning the machine off and area gets REALLY hot to touch, to the point of burning the finger. All other ports behave ok and no heating at all. Tried replacing USB-C port, replaced <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR>, CC772, CB211, CC773, <CAPACITOR>C3509</CAPACITOR>/08/07 but still same issue. Any ideas?"
