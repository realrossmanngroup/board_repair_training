( i know we don't normally work on these, which is why its more of a signal question in general.) i ran ASD OS and it failed for 0x0: SMC PID Sensor check has been tripped. it also failed for ethernet controller, and Temp(Tp0P)- AC\/DC Supply Temperature [SMC error TM_TEMP_BELOW_MIN. i wondering if anyone has had experience in this issue. \n\nI'm wondering if its more of an smc failure or if there is something else going on that I'm missing?"}
