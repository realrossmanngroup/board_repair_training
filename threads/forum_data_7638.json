The customer wants to upgrade it with a wireless card. Has anyone here seen this before and was able to upgrade it? I could just solder the connector to the board, but I'm unsure if the other necessary circuitry is present. \n\nOn a side note, I'm amazed that Apple had the nerve to omit a wireless card in a $1000+ laptop in 2009."
