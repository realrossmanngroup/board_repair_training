I have an 820-3024 that is working on battery but not recognizing it. I replaced U7000. No change. SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA is dropping down to 0V with signal. I replaced R5280 and R5281 just to make sure it wasn't one of them. Diode to ground on R5281 is .500 and .485 on R5280. I'm about to give up on this but just wanted to make sure I'm looking at a bad SMC. Computer works normally otherwise. Not a spill, probably a garbage battery if I had to guess. I'm testing with a known-good battery that works fine with a known-good board."}

Also in 200K resistor scale. You shouldn't get big difference.\nPut flux and heat SMC, to eliminate crap under it.\nIf no reaction, then bad SMC.\nBTW, PPBUS_G3H voltage value is?"}

D6950 is not present. Yeah, the difference in the bus lines is too high. This wasn't a spill and I'm looking at the customer's junk adapter and refurbished battery so I have an idea of how this happened. Interesting though, PPBUS_G3H is low at 8.19V. I didn't even think to check it being that the computer booted and the SMC worked normally outside of charging. Not sure what that's telling me considering the SMC is obviously doing enough to allow the computer to function fine but not charge."}
