        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "820-3024": "What is 820-3024? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "R5280": "What is R5280? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",
        "R5281": "What is R5281? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",

        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. ."

I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3024</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that is working on battery but not recognizing it. I replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. No change. <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA</SIGNAL> is dropping down to 0V with signal. I replaced <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR> just to make sure it wasn't one of them. Diode to ground on <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR> is .500 and .485 on <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR>. I'm about to give up on this but just wanted to make sure I'm looking at a bad SMC. Computer works normally otherwise. Not a spill, probably a garbage battery if I had to guess. I'm testing with a known-good battery that works fine with a known-good board."

Also in 200K resistor scale. You shouldn't get big difference.\nPut flux and heat SMC, to eliminate crap under it.\nIf no reaction, then bad SMC.\nBTW, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> voltage value is?"

This wasn't a spill and I'm looking at the customer's junk adapter and refurbished battery so I have an idea of how this happened. Interesting though, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is low at 8.19V. I didn't even think to check it being that the computer booted and the SMC worked normally outside of charging. Not sure what that's telling me considering the SMC is obviously doing enough to allow the computer to function fine but not charge."
