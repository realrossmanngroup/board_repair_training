Now after all this time, I get an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with no liquid damage and all signs and rails show there shouldn't be a problem. Just not getting chimes and I plug in a mouse and it just blinks popping on the mag safe and the fan immediately does what it's supposed to do, but after second spin on the fan, the CPU gets so hot you cannot even touch it. I have reprogrammed the BIOS, reflowed the SMC.....\n\nI'm at a loss and really confused, I know I am probably missing something really stupid"
