The trackpad was clicking, after trying DFU revive it doesn't click any longer.\n\nBoard is taking 20V and bouncing between 0.1A and 0.7A\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is present bouncing between 10.6V and 12.5V\n<SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> is shorted to ground\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_SSD0</SIGNAL> is present 1.8V\n\nI was reading on RepairWiki that what is important is that <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> doesn't go direct to the NAND - pardon my stupid question but how can one check this? Would the <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SSD0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> lines be ~12V?\n\nI will check tomorrow under thermal camera once I am back in the shop, with my novice knowledge does this mean SSD is dead?"
