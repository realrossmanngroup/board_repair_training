        "message":"This board was sent to me a few weeks ago not turning on with liquid damage from UB400 down to the C9344 area. I replaced all of the damaged components in those areas except for UB400 and ultrasonic'd the board. It worked perfectly fine after that and it worked for a couple of weeks before the customer sent it back to me saying it doesn't turn on anymore.\n\nWhen I plug the charger in I feel the heatsink getting warm and the trackpad clicks when I press it but the fan doesn't turn on and nothing appears on the screen. I have tried an SMC reset and unplugged the battery power but that still didn't fix it.\n\nI'm not sure what power rails to start measuring to solve this. Has anyone had this issue?"

I went back to check the fuses you asked for and as soon as I opened the lid I saw the backlight on the screen and after a few seconds the questionmark folder appeared. I shut it down using the power button(this is a touchbar) and turned it on again but nothing shows up on the screen anymore. It did it again one more time and I even heard that other chime noise it makes but I'm not sure what I did.\n\nThe board still turns on with the keyboard unplugged but nothing appears on the screen. The fan works though because I unplugged the trackpad cable and turned the machine on and the fans turned on right away.\n\nI measured F7000 when I plug the charger in it gives me around 11.6v and slowly goes up to 12.25v.\nR7020 gave me 19.82v on pins 2\/4 and 19.85v on pins 1\/3."
