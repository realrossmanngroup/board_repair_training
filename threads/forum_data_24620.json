        "820-00164": "What is 820-00164? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "R7788": "What is R7788? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

When I plugged in the new lvds cable I got 0v on backlight at the connector. I had 3.32v on <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> and 0v on <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> at one point. I replaced the 2 <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> resistors but that didn't fix the <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> issue.\n\nI put a new fuse on there but I ended up seeing there was 0v on Pin 2 of F7700. I put a couple more fuses on there and they kept blowing. I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>/7 again and put another fuse on there and it blew again.\n\nI'm not sure what could be causing this. I'm not sure if this is noteworthy but I did previously plug in the damaged LVDS to see if I had an image so I don't know if that damaged the connector internally.\n\nThe <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> area is spotless and I am seeing an image on the screen.\n\n<RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR>/89 measure the proper resistance."

I replaced the connector, used another lvds cable and put another fuse on and it blew again. I replaced the <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> then put a new fuse on and that blew as well. It looked like the backlight was turning on for half of a second before I saw the fuse blow.\nI am getting 0.26v in diode mode on pins 3/4 of the connector(that is with the blown fuse on the board).\n\nWhat else could cause this?"

I can manuever the backlight strip so I can plug it into the bare lcd but I decided to see if the fuse would blow with just the lvds cable plugged in and once again the fuse blew so I don't think the original display assembly is the issue."

            "message": "Okay I injected voltage on Pin of F7700 and got up to around 6v and there was no current so I put a little alcohol in that area and immediately <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> started sizzling and 0.83 Amps appeared. I measured Pins 1/2/5/6 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> and they were both 0v to ground in diode mode. I removed <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> and the pads are still shorted to ground. The top layer and pad of Pin1 on <RESISTOR>R5490</RESISTOR> is almost gone so I figure there was some bad liquid damage there that caused this. Pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R5490</RESISTOR> is not shorted to ground though\n\nUpdate: I measured L7701 in diode mode and both sides gave me around 0.08v to ground so I removed it from the board and Pin 1 gave me 0.08v and Pin 2 is around 0.39v so I assume the short is before pin 1. I have removed <CAPACITOR>C7712</CAPACITOR>/13 and <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>/7 but the short still remains. I injected voltage on Pin 1 of L7701 and only got around 0.1amps so I put alcohol on the <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> pads and it immediately sizzled and it showed over 3 amps. Is this a short inside the board?"
