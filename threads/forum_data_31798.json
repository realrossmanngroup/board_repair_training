        "message":"This board came in with minor liquid damage around U1900, U6100. Broken trace from pin 1 u6100 to R6117 repaired. Board now turns on and boots but seems when I flex or put pressure around L7320 area (not saying it is L7320) Vcore shuts down (1.7V to 0) PPBUS stays steady 8.5 as well as PPBUS_S5_HS_Computing. This area was not exposed to liquid. This happens with or without I\/O cable connected. \n\nThanks, have a good one."

Whats odd is that the board is screwed down. I dont know how flipping it upside down while in the machine would make difference. Lol,  this started out as such an easy board to fix too! FML.\nThanks Duke."
