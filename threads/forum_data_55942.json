            "message": "Hello, I've got an issue with <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> (15\" 2017), it came to me dead. Board has no corrosion, but someone obviously reflowed or maybe replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and CB704 - I guess that's because Louis did this in one of his videos (it's funny how often I'm getting boards from other repair shops where they did exactly the same thing that Louis did with the same board... even if it's a completely different issue, only with similar symptoms). However there is no problem with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, so I guess this part is fine.\n\nI measured and found a short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_TBT_T_S0</SIGNAL> through UB000. After removing UB000, the short is gone, the board boots and partially works. However when I soldered \"new\" UB000 (from <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> as I don't know where to buy a whole <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with this chip, or the chip itself), it shorted again after connecting the power supply. So I removed UB000 again and measured every pin of UB000 - nothing is shorted in there. Area around <CHIP>U5670</CHIP> looks untouched. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> works flawlessly with UB000 removed (and with bad UB000 it's partially shorted, that's why the machine cannot turn on I guess).\n\nI've got one last UB000 from <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and I don't want to waste it the same way as the first one, what else should I check?\nThank you"

            "message": "OK, so after changing the chip and measuring everything accessible, it looked fine, so I successfully turned it on. So I guess the first chip was really defective. However the board boots, I can install OS, but after that it hangs on \"critical update\" issue and I don't know why (SSD is fine as I can install OS on it, battery is fine, touchbar looks fine, no luck with PRAM/SMC reset or installing macOS from scratch on formated drive). Shield on <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> looks quite busted, so I will try to take it off and inspect <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>, but I'm quite afraid of it as it's an underfilled chip with some ridiculously small BGA balls (I think it's smaller than 0.2mm?). Also I don't get why, but someone pulled <CAPACITOR>C7900</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7901</CAPACITOR> and F4500 - I replaced those, but that just fixed clicking of touchpad.\n\nI will probably open a new thread later as this is probably different issue. You can mark this one as solved I think, thank you."
