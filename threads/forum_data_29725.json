        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

Don't remember, it's mine.\nAnyway, backlight is working but flex the board and the backlight goes off. I have tried replacing the backlight circuit, running wires all over the shop, poking the board in various places to find the spot, tried pissing about poking the GPU MUX which does turn backlight on and off but no more so than poking around the GPU reg or poking the 6259 or the USB HUB <CHIP>U3700</CHIP>. Fucking board's been poked more times than Louise Fokken. Tried a new LVDS connector and different screen right at the start too. Just can't locate it.\n\nBad via?\nBad ceramic cap?\nBad solder joint?\n\nGuess it could be all or any, but if there is a common cause for this, please let me know."
