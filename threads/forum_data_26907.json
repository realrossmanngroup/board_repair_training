ISL area was damage and replaced. <TRANSISTOR>Q7260</TRANSISTOR> was welded to the board. All my 3.3V S5, S3 and S0 rails are beeping to ground. I am asking for the best way to troubleshoot this issue before i try on my own and fuck this thing up more. Sometimes I tend to that. LOL.\nThanks in advance.\n\n\nDiode\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> - 0\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> - .002\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> - .003"
