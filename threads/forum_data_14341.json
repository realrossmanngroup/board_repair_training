Then full blast and I feel that the CPU is getting too fast.\nI've the CPU rail <SIGNAL>PPVVC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> which is a stable 1.78V (I was hoping for a higher voltage by a bad regulator or transistors)\n\nI would replace the Bios chip or the clock chip but I will check that first.\n\nHowever, I have a basic question since I have a few other <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with burning CPUs... should we assume CPU is dead if it's boiling or is there still hope?"
