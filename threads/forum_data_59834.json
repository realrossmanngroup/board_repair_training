        "message":"I have a 820-00165-A board originally with no pm_dsw_pwrgd, rebelled sac and got that signal. Later replaced u4600 and some capacitors around it and got pm_slp_s4_l. Sometimes i get around 3.6 watts with 1.6V on cpu (not sure if that's low normally i get 1.8) and sometimes i get no pm_slp_s4_l and only 0.8 watts. ( it sometimes dips from 3.6 to 0.8 watts)\n\nIve put this through the ultra sonic machine and is reasonably clean no major corrosion really. Could this be a bad smc?"
