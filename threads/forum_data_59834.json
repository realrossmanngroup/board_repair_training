Later replaced <CHIP>U4600</CHIP> and some capacitors around it and got <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>. Sometimes i get around 3.6 watts with 1.6V on cpu (not sure if that's low normally i get 1.8) and sometimes i get no <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> and only 0.8 watts. ( it sometimes dips from 3.6 to 0.8 watts)\n\nIve put this through the ultra sonic machine and is reasonably clean no major corrosion really. Could this be a bad smc?"
