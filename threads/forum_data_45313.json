            "message": "Hello, i have a touchbar 13 inch that had liquid damage in following area: <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>, QB701 and <CAPACITOR>C6554</CAPACITOR> & <CAPACITOR>C6553</CAPACITOR> (these last 2 not shorted). The machine was previously running from battery (when customer arrived), but display sometimes flickering, it had some waterspil. Since I assumed all was OK we ultra soniced it (did make pictures of the liquid damage prior to ultrasonic) and now the board starts up fine, but only without battery connected. The original battery was blown up, so we replaced it with a known working battery. When connecting a charger it show 20v but 0amp and not booting. When we remove the battery it starts up fine. Checked already the resister around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> they measure OK, <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> area looks very clean. Images attached for reference. What should I check first? Will checkout lewis videos as well but have a big pile to fix so not much time to watch all hope you can point me in the right direction."
