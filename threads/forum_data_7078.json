So to have an indication where the short can be caused is to separate that line where the short is. To get that done I had to lift the coil L7130. Like that I have separatede the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> from the <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>.  When testing I ve seen that there is no short is detected in pin 1 of the coil L7130, but the short remains on pin2. This means that the short can be caused from the other side of the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>.\nAND <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> must be 8V6. But at pin1/2 of F7700 1V1. \nF7700 is not blown and the voltage on pin4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> is 1V1.\nI ve lifted the ic <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> because of the blown like image it shows at the top of it like you see on the picture. \nIn my opinion there is only two ways left to be checked that can cause the short namely, <SIGNAL>ISNS_LCDBKLT_P</SIGNAL> or <SIGNAL>ISNS_LCDBKLT_N</SIGNAL>.\n\nYour latst question concerning if it is still working, I need to solder the IC <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> back, that I think is bad, and will let you know."
