After cleaning it looks ok.\n\n- Light from power adapter is  green\n\n- Checked the following power rails:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: 8.4V\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_CPU_IMVP_ISNS</SIGNAL>: 8.4V\n<SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_CONN</SIGNAL>: 17.1V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H_REG</SIGNAL>: 3.4V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL>: 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_REG</SIGNAL>: 0V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU_REG</SIGNAL>: 0V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_REG</SIGNAL>: 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3_FET</SIGNAL>: 0V\n\nTried to get to the source why <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL> is 0V.\n- Checked [FONT=Courier]<CHIP>U7201</CHIP>(TPS51[/FONT]220)[FONT=Courier][SIZE=2] enable:[/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Courier][SIZE=2] - EN1: 0V[/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Courier][SIZE=2] - EN2: 3.4V[/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Courier][SIZE=2]Followed EN1 / [/SIZE][/FONT]<SIGNAL>P5VS3_EN</SIGNAL> which is same as <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> (double checked voltage also 0), which ends in <CHIP>U1400</CHIP> (MCP79).\n\nMy only idea left is that the <CAPACITOR>C7812</CAPACITOR> could be broken and pulls <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> to ground. But <CAPACITOR>C7812</CAPACITOR> looks like it is not put on the board (there was a No Stuff comment on the diagram).\n\nFollowed source where <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3_FET</SIGNAL> is supposed to come from. Ended up at <TRANSISTOR>Q7910</TRANSISTOR>. Source of the MOSFET is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3_P3V3S3FET</SIGNAL>, which I measured 3.3V. <SIGNAL>P3V3S3_SS</SIGNAL> is around 3.15V, which if I understand it correctly explains that the MOSFET switches <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3_FET</SIGNAL> off. Then I tried to figure out why <SIGNAL>P3V3S3_SS</SIGNAL> is 3.15V. This is due to <SIGNAL>P3V3S3_EN</SIGNAL> is 0V.\n<SIGNAL>P3V3S3_EN</SIGNAL> is <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> and so the reason is the same as above.\n\nNow I'm stuck as I cannot tell why <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> is 0V. If anybody has some ideas what to do, I would greatly appreciate it."
