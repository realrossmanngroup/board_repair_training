        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",

        "PP3V3_3": "What is PP3V3_3? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

I have checked traces, checked resistors in the area and replaced both <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7010</TRANSISTOR>. With original charger I am getting pulses of 16.60 - 16.80V on the DC-in connector. With the Chinese one I get a steady 16.5V in the same test location. Powers on automatically when magsafe is plugged in with a battery attached.  What can I be missing?\n\nHave a good one."
