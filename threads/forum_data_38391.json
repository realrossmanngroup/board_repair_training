Resistance keeps incrementally increasing.\n\n[U][B]TEST 3: [/B][/U] Checked the following caps visually for signs of over heating or damage. <CAPACITOR>C7760</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7761</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7762</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7763</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7764</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7765</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7766</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7767</CAPACITOR>,C7 768,<CAPACITOR>C7769</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7770</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7772</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7773</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7774</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7775</CAPACITOR>,C777 6 AND <CAPACITOR>C7717</CAPACITOR>.\n[U][B]RESULT: [/B][/U]None of the caps have signs of heat or water damage. All caps look happy.\n\n[U][B]TEST 4:[/B][/U] Decided to check voltage on above caps.\n[U][B]RESULT:[/B][/U] All caps read 0.0v on the positive terminals\n\n[U][B]TEST 5:[/B][/U] Carried out dide test on <DIODE>D7710</DIODE> and checked for voltage on each terminal\n[U][B]RESULT:[/B][/U] Diode test was ok <DIODE>D7710</DIODE> passes unidirectionally.\nVoltage test = 0.0V\n\n[U][B]TEST 6: [/B][/U]Checked coil L7710 for resistance\n[U][B]RESULT:[/B][/U] 0.1 OHM OK\n\n[U][B]TEST 7: [/B][/U]Checked caps <CAPACITOR>C7710</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7711</CAPACITOR>,AND <CAPACITOR>C7712</CAPACITOR> for short to GND\n[U][B]RESULT:[/B][/U] None of the above caps were shorted to GND.\n\n\n[U][B]TEST 8: [/B][/U]Checked <SIGNAL>PPVIN_SOSW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> voltage on pins 6,5,2 and 1 at <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR>\n[U][B]RESULT:[/B][/U] Voltage= 0.0 V\nComment It should be 12.9 v?\n\n[U][B]TEST 9:[/B][/U] Checked voltage at pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> <SIGNAL>PPVIN_SOSW_LCDBKLT_R</SIGNAL>\n[U][B]RESULT:[/B][/U] Voltage of 12.9 V present at pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR>\n\n\n\nA major problem here in Kenya is availability of parts or for that matter even doner boards.\nSo I do not have a test LCD neither do I have a board to pick components from unfortunately.\n\nMy diagnosis led me to <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> AND <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> simply because I reached a dead end since I could not\ncomprehend how the backlight circuit actually works and what factors activate the backlight circuit\non <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> and thus <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR>.\n\nThat said I placed a two weeks order for <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>, replaced both and here I am...........\nstill no voltages on <SIGNAL>PPVIN_SOSW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> and so no amplification and thus no voltage on\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>. :(\n\n[U][B]QUESTION:[/B][/U]\n1.How does <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> work and switch ON?\n2.Does <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> need to be switched ON by <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>?\n3.If question 3 is a yes, then what factors trigger <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> to switch ON <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR>\n\nIn short I need help.\n\nThanks and Many Regards from Mombasa Kenya\nImran Osman\nIMspot Repairs."
