        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

            "message": "Hi there, this board occassionallyy will briefly take some amperage and drop just below 20V like its going to boot but 95% of the time it just sits at 0A and 20V. PPBUS is at 13V. \n\nAll S5 rails are missing when in the 20V 0A state. I have detected voltage on CPU rails on occasions when it is drawing amps. \n\nChecked with infrared and not seeing anything get hot at any time.\n\nI checked the SMBUS SMC SCL/SDA lines related to the battery and those are good. SMC ONOFF is 3v3 and <SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW</SIGNAL> is not shorted. I'm uncertain as to the power up sequence for these boards. I feel like this is something simple."

I put some heat to SMC prior and it was up at 20V 0A and I unplugged and plugged back in and suddenly 5V 0A. I tried BPS to drive voltage through that rail and only thing getting hot is the wire and the point of attachement of my power supply where it's jumpered on board. If I jumper different spot it gets hot there instead. I pulled both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s on the side where I was connected to charger when it stopped working and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is still shorted. \n\nIn summary I don't understand wtf happened, I don't understand why I'm not seeing whatever is shorted getting hot on the IR and I dont have a clue as to where to look next. haha\n\nI may just call this a no fix rather as I've managed to somehow spend way too much time on this one already"
