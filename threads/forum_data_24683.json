            "message": "Im working on a fun one agin. customer brought this machine in and stated that the keyboard and trackpad randomly stops functioning. when it was brought in i was able to verify that they did not work. i unplugged the battery to drain all power but still not functioning not even in boot menu. I did a smc reset and it started working again. sent the customer on his way. Now the customer is back with same issue. \n\nit seems to be a problem maybe have had according to google search results.\nthen yesterday i another customer come in with the same issue. today I've been trying to replicate this problem, but haven't got the machine to do it again. Not even really sure where to start with this.\n\ni did check for liquid damage and doesn't appear to have been dropped. seems like another one of apples screw ups. \n\nJust wondering if anyone else has run across this issue or possible have a solution for it?"
