        "message":"Board is clean, PPBUS_G3H and PP3V42 present.\nTook a visual on the board and it looks pristine, except that I've found discolored Q3880 and C3895 had solder balls around.\nThen started going through power rails to see what is present and found that PP3V3_S5 gives 0V or is dead shorted 0 Ohms.\n\nQ7260 pins 1, 2 and 6 are good. Others are shorted. So that leaves small chance that it's shorted from L7260 pins 2 backward. I can remove L7260 to test the theory, but I don't think so since PP3V3_S5 goes everywhere.\n\nI've injected 1V into the rail, but nothing pops out on thermal."
