            "message": "A little history for this one. It's a coworker of mine's computer and over the weekend he plugged in an external USB DVD drive which caused his machine for some reason to shut completely off. When he tried to power it back on, the LCD was completely shot with a blank display (worked on external monitor but it wouldn't see his internal display whatsoever). No big deal, we replace the top panel and all seems well again. Well the next day (today) it turns out his computer is getting extremely hot when turned on and also when put in sleep mode too, so he gives it back to me to check out. \n\nAdvancing forward and after some freeze spray I am able to determine <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> is the culprit of this heat issue. Display plugged in or not makes no difference but this little component gets extremely hot almost instantaneously. The confusing part for me is that the component itself is working how its supposed to and has proper readings all around but still gets hot when powered on or in sleep. Should I just replace it even though it seems to be working fine? Has anyone seen something like this before? Also on a side-note, has anyone seen a DVD drive cause a display to go out? Thanks in advance!"
