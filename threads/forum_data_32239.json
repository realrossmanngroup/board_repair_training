            "message": "<RESISTOR>R7918</RESISTOR> being 0.5kohm means it is 500 ohms when it should be 100kohms. \n\n99% of the time, resistors do not go bad by going down in resistance, they go bad by going up in resistance. Do keep in mind that the resistor is not all you are measuring here. On pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R7918</RESISTOR> is <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL>, and on pin 2 is ground. it is not the resistor you are measuring there. Rather, you are measuring the resistance of every possible path to ground between <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> and ground.\n\nSo, <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> is shorted to ground here. There are three potential paths to ground for <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL>\n\n1) <CHIP>U1800</CHIP>.\n2) <RESISTOR>R7918</RESISTOR>\n3) <CHIP>U7940</CHIP>.\n\nIf you remove <CHIP>U7940</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R7918</RESISTOR> and you still have 500 ohms to ground, then <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> is your issue.\n\nIf that is the case, you would have to replace <CHIP>U1800</CHIP>. In this case you would also have to reprogram the BIOS with a clean ME region so it doesn't act all weird talking to the new PCH.\n\nIMO, this is only something to do if you legit have nothing else to work on. You will sink at least another hour into this and $15-$45 for a new chip to fix a seven year old board that may or may not work afterwards, which, if it were on my desk.. screw that. But to each their own. ;)"
