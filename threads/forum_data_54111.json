The flash of 100mA is caused by the brief 1/10 sec turn on of <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>.  <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> is on for just a split second and no thermal signatures out of the normal are detected. \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is never present during this cycle.  \n25 Mhz clock is present\n3V3 enable flashes but only to 0.5v along the same time line as <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>.\n\nI feel like a newbie asking for help on this board.   But I am flat stuck."
