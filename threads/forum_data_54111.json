U3900 is on for just a split second and no thermal signatures out of the normal are detected. \nPP3V3_S0 is never present during this cycle.  \n25 Mhz clock is present\n3V3 enable flashes but only to 0.5v along the same time line as U3900.\n\nI feel like a newbie asking for help on this board.   But I am flat stuck."
