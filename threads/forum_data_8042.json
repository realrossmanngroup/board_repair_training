        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",

        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",

Received board with no obvious water damage or corrosion anywhere, it actually looks spotless. I do have <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and a green light on the charger and what I have as a result of further testing so far is <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> present, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_PCH_PWRGD</SIGNAL> present, and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> present. I know that the clock circuit is needed as well which I've got readings of 3.3v on pin 2 and 3.3v on pin <SIGNAL>VDD_RTC_OUT</SIGNAL>. I'm kinda stuck on where to go from here and was just seeking guidance to what to check next. Thanks in advance!"
