Received board with no obvious water damage or corrosion anywhere, it actually looks spotless. I do have PPBUS_G3H and a green light on the charger and what I have as a result of further testing so far is PP5V_S5 present, PP3V3_S5_PCH_PWRGD present, and PP3V3_SUS present. I know that the clock circuit is needed as well which I've got readings of 3.3v on pin 2 and 3.3v on pin VDD_RTC_OUT. I'm kinda stuck on where to go from here and was just seeking guidance to what to check next. Thanks in advance!"}
