This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",

            "message": "Was hoping this would be a <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>/SMC/J9500 issue, but it's not proving to be that simple.\n\nThis board came from a customer unit that was an Apple refurbished piece of garbage, and the board failed in the unit. I notice the board has been repaired from significant liquid in the past (repairs look old, covered in dust, etc), but the symptoms are confusing me:\n\n1. PPBUS was 8.17v and no green light; no shorts on ppbus or 3v42. I checked <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and then moved onto replacing the SMC.\n\n2. Replaced SMC, and issues persist.\n\n3. I inspected J9500 very, very well, and no issues found.\n\n4. Replaced SMC again, issue remains.\n\n5. Measurements at <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> are all correct and steady.\n\nI'm not sure what else to check at this point. Unit does not power on from battery either. No green light after 2 SMCs, no shorts. Known-good DC-In/cable (3). Any ideas? Am I missing something \"further up\" in the power-on sequence? Not having the proper block diagram makes it harder for me on these boards. All help appreciated."
