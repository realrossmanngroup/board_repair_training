        "A1286": "What is A1286? A1286 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2009 , Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2255, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2330, 820-2532, 820-2523, 820-2533, 820-2850, 820-2915, 820-3330..",
        "820-3330": "What is 820-3330? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15” Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",
        "U6990": "What is U6990? a CHIP.",
        "U6900": "What is U6900? a CHIP.",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line..",
        "R6990": "What is R6990? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on Macbooks from around the year 2012. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",
        "Q5310": "What is Q5310? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. ."
