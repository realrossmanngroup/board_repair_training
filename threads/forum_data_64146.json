Left USB ports were working only for charging but not for data. They would not send power to USB devices, so I replaced U3500 and it started overheating USB devices connected to any port and would not mount them, so I replaced U3500 again, still same issue, it even burned an external SSD I had here to store installers. I'm stuck and afraid of going further and burn more things."}
