Rework near DC in, PP3v42 area, BKLT area, bottom right back corner of the board, PP3v3_SUS circuit, and a few other areas. Nothing near ISL or SMC. The problem with this one is it will not charge\/run off of a battery. It does for sure recognize a good battery; however, the OS shows it as not charging. The board will also not start off the battery by shorting the power pads. PPBUS is 8.56 volts. Here's what I've replaced so far:\n\nThe ISL and every single resistor\/cap by it. (Current sensing measures good for both pins 17\/18 and 27\/28)\nThe ISL along with Q7180, Q7130, and Q7155 at the same time. (Still no change)\nThe PP3v42 area along with R7005\/6 and the diode (didn't trust them still no change)\n\nI am totally out of ideas on what else could be causing this. Any ideas?"}
