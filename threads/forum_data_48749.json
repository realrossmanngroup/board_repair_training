            "message": "So this one was a refurbished board from some other company and they replaced A LOT of stuff at least 30 components or so. Rework near DC in, PP3v42 area, BKLT area, bottom right back corner of the board, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> circuit, and a few other areas. Nothing near ISL or SMC. The problem with this one is it will not charge/run off of a battery. It does for sure recognize a good battery; however, the OS shows it as not charging. The board will also not start off the battery by shorting the power pads. PPBUS is 8.56 volts. Here's what I've replaced so far:\n\nThe ISL and every single resistor/cap by it. (Current sensing measures good for both pins 17/18 and 27/28)\nThe ISL along with <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR>, and <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> at the same time. (Still no change)\nThe PP3v42 area along with <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>/6 and the diode (didn't trust them still no change)\n\nI am totally out of ideas on what else could be causing this. Any ideas?"
