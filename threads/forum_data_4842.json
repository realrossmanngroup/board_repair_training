Visual inspection and <CAPACITOR>C7314</CAPACITOR> is destroyed. I replace it and still no power/fan and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is now 4.5V. After measuring around forever, I finally measure BOTH pins of F7140, pin 2 is at 4.5 and pin 1 is 8.6. I measure for continuity and there is none! Has anyone ran into a partially blown fuse before?? I still consider myself a novice-- Louis, I think I have seen all of your videos, but I have never heard of this??"
