        "message":"Got an 820-00244 on the bench that suffered liquid damage on a couple parts by the CPU. They were slightly corroded so I plugged in the LB and in started out taking 0.06A @ 19.8V. after doing some measuring, it is drawing .06A @ 5V. I measured pin 1 and 4 of Q3100 and they are 11.1V and 7.24V respectively. Does this mean U3100 is bad? Board is on the bench with nothing else plugged in."
