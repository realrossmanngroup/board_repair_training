            "message": "Hey guys got an interesting one in. This device powers on and works normally, but the keyboard and trackpad are not recognized in the OS. The power button does work on any keyboard I try to turn the machine on and off, but no matter what keyboard or trackpad I use, the machine will come up with the bluetooth keyboard and trackpad notification on screen searching for a keyboard and trackpad. I have no reason to believe this device had liquid damage as the board looks really clean, and the keys and trackpad do not feel sticky nor look corroded. I see in the schematic that the power for the Tpad and keyboard comes from the CPU then goes to the USB hub then to the controller IC for the tpad and keyboard, and then finally to the keyboard and tpad. The connectors for both look flawless no burned test points or vias. Where do I start on troubleshooting this? I'm guessing <CHIP>U2700</CHIP> is ok as i do get a light on a USB mouse for both USB ports."
