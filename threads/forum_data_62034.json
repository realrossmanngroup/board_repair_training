Stuck it in the ultrasonic cleaner and replaced the 2 caps. Still on 20v 0a.\n\nStarted trouble shoots the rails:\n\nPPBUS - 13.10v \nPP3V3_S5 - fluctuating \nPP5V_S4 - fluctuating\nPP5V-S5 -fluctuating\n\nReplaced U7650 along with Q7660 & Q7680 to rule out the possibility that it was coming from a bad MOSFET. still the same\n\nReplaced U7800 still the same. Removed L7690 and the fluctuation is coming from the system side (pin 1)\n\nCheck all the above rails and non of them are shorted to ground. Also had a prob on other rails and non of them are shorted either.\n\nAny help of what to try next?"}
