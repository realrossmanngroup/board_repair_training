Got an 820-00840 that was negotiating 19V with charger but drawing just 0.02A. During measuring I slipped the probe of the multimeter and burned the PP3V3_G3H_VR circuitry and no 19V anymore obviously. I managed to fix the 3V3 circuit and board is giving 3.3V again but still no 19V. On USBXCA I get steady 5.1V, 0.03A. On USBCXB I also get 5.1V 0.03 amps but it keeps resetting my charger. I thought maybe U3200 was dead and replaced it, still same behavior. Verified all caps around U3200 and U3100 and there are no shorts. Any ideas?"}
