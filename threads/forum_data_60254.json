It rarely detects the chip and I end up spending a lot of time trying to figure out what chip, so I'm rarely ever able to just plug it into the j-connector and reprogram, I end up pulling the board if the chip is on bottom. This would be ok as I can log the chip types per board numbers but 50% of the time I'm unable to find a compatible chip configuration that will successfully read the chip! Seems as though a lot of chips on Macs are not setup in EZP2019 software.\n\nAm I missing something with this? Is there a way to get updates? Or manually configure?"}
