Replaced and now all ports go to 5.1V .2A w\/ PPBUS_G3H at 12.3V but not boosting to 20V. no shorts on major coils that I can detect. SSD voltages are not present  but SSD_PMU_RESET_L is present. Does this mean U9000 is likely issue?\n\nThis board does go into DFU but appears to not transition to next DFU state when trying to revive in configurator."}
