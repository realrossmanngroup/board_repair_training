I suppose this means a short to ground. I know 7 Ohms could be fine for some rails such as CPU VCore, but I think this is no good for that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> rail, right ?\n\nIs there anything else I should check before I try to inject some voltage into that rail in order to find the short ?"

I could see it was drawing between 200mA and 300mA for some time, but while I was trying to feel heat on the board, I saw the power supply current went down to just a few milliamps.\nSo, looks like the short fused by itself. Now it is gone, and I have about 0.6KOhms to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> which looks quite better.\n\nHowever, I still do not have any S5 rails coming up.

One of them comes from the SSD connector, so it's probably normal as I do not have an SSD connected. The other one comes from the PMIC <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>.\nLooks like that chip has two power inputs, one that comes from <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, but it can't be that one, since that chip must turn on the S5 rails, so...\nThe other power input that I see is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_LDO3V</SIGNAL>, and on that one I only get 1.8V, so something is probably wrong there I guess ?
