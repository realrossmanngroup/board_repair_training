I used the USC anyway but  I couldn't see any other issues. \n\nI'm not sure where to find the course of the PP5V_S0 but after looking and looking It seems to come from U9500.\n\nThere is no 5v coming from here.\n\nNo PP5V_S0 from u9500\n\nPin 19 VSS is 0v\nPin 3 VCC is 3.6v not 5v\nPin 5 Vref3 is 3.2v not 5v\n\nHow do I identify the switch to turn on pin 19?\n\nAny other ideas as to what my issue might be? I have looked at many videos but they all seem to end in finding a corroded area and replacing the component. I don't have any obvious bad components.\n\nThank you"
