Had 12.6V on PPBUS. only corrosion near U7200 and the wifi plug J3501. Replaced U7200 and got fan spin. Discovered I was missing PP1V05 and was able to resore that by replacing U7600. \n\nI have ALL_SYS_PWRGD but no VCore. Is there a way to tell if the SMC is the issue or FDMF? I dont have a good board to compare to."}
