When I power this up, I get the power chime, but then all I'm seeing is this single horizontal white line across the bottom area of the screen as pictured.  I have connected this to an external display but I am not getting any output there.  Does this seem like a board issue or screen issue?  I would think if it were the screen, I'd still get output to the external display, no?"
