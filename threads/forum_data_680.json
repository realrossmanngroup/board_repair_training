Now it appears the circuit is not being boosted to drive the backlight. \nI also replaced 0910\n\n\nI'm getting 14.3V on PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT on the LVDS connector but no backlight. \nI'm guessing there is no boost?\nDiode mode measurement on PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT is 0.608\nSW via is blown?\nHow do check the SW traces?"}

BKL_EN 2.7v? \n\nYou check the SW trace by removing the LP8550 and testing continuity of the two switch pads to pin 2 of L9701. It sucks, a waste of an lp8550. :( \n\nbut that shouldn't cause this low 14.3v. Is it consistent 14.3v, or is it a spike that then slowly diminishes to 1.2v over time? The latter can mean issue between Q9706 and L9701 - this is a common path to corrode, and that is what will happen when the via inside the board blows.\n\nKeep the meter there and tell me if it is a consistent 14.3v on backlight output, and also, BKL_EN voltage please! :)"}
