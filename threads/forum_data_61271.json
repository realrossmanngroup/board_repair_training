            "message": "Hello,\n\nI receive a MacBook Pro that does not want to turn on. I found there was a shorted <CHIP>U7310</CHIP> (unsure if CPU is fried already). Replaced, fan spin and was ready to put together to test, but no longer getting a fan spin after unplugging and replugging charger. Checked <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> not present. Removed PWRGD resistors one by one and finally <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> which brought <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> back. Fan spins again, however there is 0 volts CPU vcore on all coils. I tried replacing <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, no go. Measurements I think are pointing back to <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, but is there anything else I should check?\n\nAny advice? Thanks!"

Replugging the power and it did the same thing. Did it a 3rd, 4th, 5th time, etc and now it's just dead 0 volts - no fan spin. Intermittent issue where if I keep it unplugged for longer then plugging it back in allows the fan to spin and a pulse on vcore. Perhaps <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is bad or this is consistent with a fried CPU. I don't have a good board to test it against.\n\nI have more <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>'s coming in and will try replacing all 3 mosfets too since I replaced only 1 (is that a good idea?).\n\nThere are some PGOOD signals I want to check, but the board view I have is not exact making it pretty difficult to troubleshoot some parts of the board."
