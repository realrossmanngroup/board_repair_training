Lower resistance to ground on CPU rails","user_id":680,"username":"phuketmymac","post_date":"2018-03-17 00:41:34","message":"Hello,\n\nI have that mainboard which had Q7802 ripped off and which has been obvisouly reworked near the jack connector.\nThe board would not start until I re-install Q7802.\n\nNow the board has the fan spinning but doesn't seem to get a hot enough CPU and has no picture either on the LCD or the Thunderbolt display.\nA USB mouse will light on.\nI am getting no beep if the RAM in unplugged.\n\nI am though getting a 1.1V on PPVCORE_S0_CPU but 0V on PPVCORE_S0_AXG which makes sense since I don't get a picture on the screen.\n\nMeasuring the resistance to ground on these 2 rails, I am getting 4ohms compared to 11 ohms on a good working board.\n\nI am guessing that the CPU got a hit but I am wondering if replacing U7400 could help in case the chip could be the reason of the low resistance to ground.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks."}

Do a PRAM reset with an external keyboard and see if there is a chime from the speaker in the  topcase."}

None so I put back the original Bios chip.\n\nIt really sounds like the CPU is not doing its job.\n\nAny other thing I could try?"}

Can anyone give me his reading?"}

As the board has been messed with it could be any knocked off component at this point. U7400 certainly won't fix anything. Try a BIOS from a good board for testing."}
