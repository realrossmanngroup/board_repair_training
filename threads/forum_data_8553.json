Any idea what might be causing it? Flashing glitchy colored boxes. Screen displays normally sometimes. Sometimes no video (but has backlight). The backlight also randomly has been going out. Works fine on an external monitor. The latest pattern is that it chimes, no video, and then when it boots it goes to the glitchy colors. The computer is functioning behind it though."}

Endless amounts of issues all because of the screen. After days of testing I got it to show up with a new board. New screen with original board works fine after days of numerous restarts."}
