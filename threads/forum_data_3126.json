I am attaching a photo of the area that suffered some liquid damage.[\/SIZE]\n[SIZE=14px]The issue is obvious, so my questions are:[\/SIZE]\n[SIZE=14px]1) Louis do you have these lvds connectors for sale? Are the connectors the same from 2012 on?[\/SIZE]\n[SIZE=14px]\u200b2) I will replace the C8301 and the L8300 and the LVDS connector. Is there any secret to replacing the connector without damaging the surrounding areas from the hot air station\n\nThe computer does boot and chime, but for obvious reasons no screen[\/SIZE]"}

I received it this way. The screen cable has a the end pin blown off. It also looks like it was butchered by someone.
