        "820-2915": "What is 820-2915? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "U7201": "What is U7201? U7201 is responsible for the 3.3v and 5v power rails on many devices..",
        "U4900": "What is U4900? This is the System Management Controller(SMC) in older(pre-2013) macbooks.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

It shows a green light on the charger when plugged in but nothing else. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.59v and there was no voltage on any of the S5 or S3 rails.\nI traced the issue to <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> where there was 0v on <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL>. I went to the probe point(1227) that is next to the SMC(<CHIP>U4900</CHIP>) to measure <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> and all of a sudden the fans spun and the CPU got warm.\nI turned unplugged the charger and plugged it back in but again no fan spin. When I touched the probe point with any metal the fan starts spinning again. There is continuity from that probe point to <RESISTOR>R7940</RESISTOR>. \n\nI haven't seen something like this before and don't know what I could do to fix this."
