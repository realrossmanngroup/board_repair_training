Can we still have power in de PP3V42_G3H and maybe the one wire adapter sense is not good, or would there be no power on 3.42 if some part of the circuit is damaged? Sorry for the noob question:)\n\nEdit i also noticed R5400 is missing but that wont be powered anyway without the system starting,i gues"
