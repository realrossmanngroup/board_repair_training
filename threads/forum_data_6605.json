Can we still have power in de <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and maybe the one wire adapter sense is not good, or would there be no power on 3.42 if some part of the circuit is damaged? Sorry for the noob question:)\n\nEdit i also noticed <RESISTOR>R5400</RESISTOR> is missing but that wont be powered anyway without the system starting,i gues"
