Please tell us. \n\nSome more.\n\n1) Is the voltage on VIN pin of <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> STABLE, or does it go up and down?\n\n2) Are you measuring for a short to ground on L7095 with power plugged in? If so, DON'T! Measure without power plugged in. \n\n3) Where did this <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> chip come from?\n\n4) Are you using too much heat and roasting it?\n\n5) Are you sure this is soldered properly?\n\nThere is not much to this."
