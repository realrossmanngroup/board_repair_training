I fixed that R1961 trace. I originally thought it wouldn't matter so I was going to just leave it. C1950 needs to go sideways on these to reach the scraped off trace when the original pad is often blown off. 3.4V is solid in that area."}

It did end up being the U1950 circuit. The PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK trace was blown at the pad I circled. It was't getting to R1962. Thanks for the help."}
