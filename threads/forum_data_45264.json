PPBUS was shorted so I removed Q3880 and short was gone. Other stuff should also be replaced, but that can wait I think.\n\nAlways present rails are good. PP3V42 and PPBUS are 3.42V and 12.59V.\n\nThen I proceeded to check other rails, PP5V_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are also good. That's about it for the rails. PP5V_SUS and PP3V3_SUS are not present. They share Q7822, which fails because P5V_3V3_SUS_EN is not present. It is created by U7940. U7940 VCC Pin and SMC_BATLOW_L are present. PM_SLP_SUS_L is not present. It comes from PCH. Checked input signals and found only SMC_ADAPTER_EN present. PM_RSMRST_L is not present.\n\nTraced that back and got to U7930.\n\nPin 1 RESET ----- 0V\nPin 2 GND ------- 0V\nPin 3 NC --------- 3.3V?\nPin 4 CT --------- 0.08V\nPin 5 SENSE --- 0V\nPin 6 VDD ------- 3.3V\n\nProbably should have just written rail names. Okay, so, I've replaced it with another one, same results.\n\nQ5040:\nSMC_BATLOW_L is 3.3V\nPM_BATLOW_L is 0V\nPP3V3_SUS is 0V\n\nReading datasheet about it says that Pin 1 Reset RESET remains low (asserted) for the reset period after both SENSE is above VIT and MR is set to a logic high. A pull-up resistor from 10 k? to 1 M? should be used on this pin, and allows the reset pin to attain voltages higher than VDD.\n\nTell me please I am in a wrong rabbit hole.\n\nI?m using 2 original 60W and 85W chargers."}
