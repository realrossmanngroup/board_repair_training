        "U8000": "What is U8000? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "C9560": "What is C9560? Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics.",

        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. ."
