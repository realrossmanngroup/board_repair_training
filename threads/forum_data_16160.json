It has no audio, with the following symptoms:\n\n1. Audio works on system startup--chime works fine and is audible as normal--but \"greyed out\" icon in OSX.\n2. No output device shown in System Prefs, but when headphones are inserted, they show up and work normally.\n3. PRAM reset does not fix issue.\n4. Headphones do work, and I tried to make sure the internal switch in J6700 wasn't stuck (doesn't appear to be).\n5. Pins 1 and 2 of J6700 are not shorted with headphones removed.\n6. R6805 measures out fine (20k)\n7. Audio areas of the board look fine, and the few filters I checked on the circuit all have continuity.\n\nI'm out of ideas to look at this point. Any help appreciated--thanks!"}
