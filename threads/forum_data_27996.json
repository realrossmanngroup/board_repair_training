        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U7400": "What is U7400? a CHIP.",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "PVCCSA_EN": "What is PVCCSA_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7974": "What is R7974? a RESISTOR.",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance â€“ this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",
        "PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT": "What is PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT? PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT is a 0.75v power rail present when the machine is in an S0 working state .",
