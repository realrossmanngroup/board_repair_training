No signs of corrosion\/liquid damage. \n\nThe computer turns on, chimes  and no video. NO Bloq Mayus acitivity. No video on HDMI port. No video on thunderbolt.\nI have flashed a new bios and the problem persisted. \nI reflowed U8400 with my reballing station and same problem. No change. \nWhat should I measure?"}
