I had to remove SMC to figure it out, which I soldered back, but still PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC was at 0V.\n\nSo I have now:\nPP3V42_G3H : 3.4V\nPPBUS_G3H : 0V\nPP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC : 0V\n\nPP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA : 3.4V\nSMC_RESET_L  : 3.4V\n\nShould I replace the SMC, or are there other checks to be done before?"}

There were some liquid damage, so I cleaned it but now there are stained conductive traces quite close to the soldering balls. Do you think it is manually feasible to solder an SMC here? Or there are hidden shorts when the SMC is in place and it is the reason why I don't manage to have it working?\n\nI tested all the voltages from the previous post directly on the balls and it is ok, the traces are fine"}

He mentioned that SMCs should be taken only from donor boards, because new chips were not programed. This was 7 years ago. I bought the new SMC I used for this board on Aliexpress last year. Is it still the case that new SMC chips are just sold \"empty\"? This may explain it does not work?"}

As I mentioned in the first post I have PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC : 0V but also PPBUS_G3H : 0V. Am I correct that PPBUS_G3H : 0V is another issue not linked with the SMC? My understanding is that SMC and ISL6259 should both start at the same time, with PPBUS_G3H reaching 8.2V, then when they communicate PPBUS_G3H : 8.6V, true? If so I have another problem with this board"}
