It has no display or back light.\nIt's taking 20V and 400 milli amps. All voltages are present. DFU revive finished successfully.\nAlso tried another display and same result.\nNoticed CPU is getting hot.\nVoltage on L7230 and L7210 is 0.950 volts which is bit higher. As, I have compared these with working mother board."}
