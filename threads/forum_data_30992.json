I got a dead 820-3115\n\nI have a missing resistor that I need to replace but i need and i.d.\nCan anyone tell me what the 20 is and am I able to use something similar coz i dont have exact same one on donor board?"}

It\u2019s a 20ohm resistor 1\/16 Watr MF-LF 402 piece. That\u2019s what you would enter in Mouser or Digikey if you buy it individually. Otherwise you can steal a resistor from a different board with the same values."}
