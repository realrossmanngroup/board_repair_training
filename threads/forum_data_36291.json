    "definitions": {
        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "C9782": "What is C9782? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "U3990": "What is U3990? a CHIP.",
        "R9731": "What is R9731? a RESISTOR.",

For the past two days I have been following all the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> No Back Light posts, and up until tonight, I'm at a dead end.\n\nAll voltages are correct, no break in any traces, parts all mentioned in other posts replaced, last part replaced tonight was <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> which showed high so changed out the resistor and it now shows low on open lid. For the LIFE of me, I cannot figure out what I am missing, and I KNOW it's something stupid retarded, so I am finally reaching out for some help.\n\nBoard powers on on impact of magsafe green light, orange light, chimes, see faint image, boots... But I cannot for the life of me get the backlight to turn on. If any of you have any ideas on what on earth I am missing, please by all means see what I am missing. I built this board from the ground up with no green light, nothing and this is my last snag, the fun part was running a wire through the board for the RTC, if I can manage to find THAT what on earth am I missing on the backlight :(\n\n**Forgot to mention I have tried the board in two different chassis...."
