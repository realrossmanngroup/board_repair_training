        "message":"Awesome work guys, just needed to say that. I usually find everything I need in this forum for my answers to the things I get stuck on. For the past two days I have been following all the 820-3115 No Back Light posts, and up until tonight, I'm at a dead end.\n\nAll voltages are correct, no break in any traces, parts all mentioned in other posts replaced, last part replaced tonight was SMC_LID which showed high so changed out the resistor and it now shows low on open lid. For the LIFE of me, I cannot figure out what I am missing, and I KNOW it's something stupid retarded, so I am finally reaching out for some help.\n\nBoard powers on on impact of magsafe green light, orange light, chimes, see faint image, boots... But I cannot for the life of me get the backlight to turn on. If any of you have any ideas on what on earth I am missing, please by all means see what I am missing. I built this board from the ground up with no green light, nothing and this is my last snag, the fun part was running a wire through the board for the RTC, if I can manage to find THAT what on earth am I missing on the backlight :(\n\n**Forgot to mention I have tried the board in two different chassis...."
