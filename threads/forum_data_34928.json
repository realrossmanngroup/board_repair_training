        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "U7001": "What is U7001? a CHIP.",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H? PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H is the input voltage to the PP3V42_G3H buck converter circuit, it can be either charger voltage or battery voltage depending on what the system power source is. This often shorts to ground when one of the input capacitors dies. .",
        "D7105": "What is D7105? Diodes between PPDCIN_G3H charger voltage and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, when CHGR_DCIN Is low(less than charger voltage) and PPBUS_G3H is missing this is a critical point to troubleshoot.",
        "BC_ACOK": "What is BC_ACOK? This is a typo of SMC_BC_ACOK. When you see BC_ACOK, assume they meant to type SMC_BC_ACOK."
