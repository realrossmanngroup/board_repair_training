They all had no liquid, no apparent damage, and I was wondering if anyone has resolved this type of issue before on this specific board? I've spent hours trying to determine what is causing <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> to be low, but can't figure it out. I've had help in previous threads recommending I remove <RESISTOR>R7963</RESISTOR>-67 one-by-one and see which of those rails is pulling down <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, but on each board, I removed those resistors and the signal stayed low each time. I got stuck on all of them, and set them aside. I am 100% confident they have no liquid damage. I'm positive they haven't been worked on before. PP3v42, ppbus, ppvrtc, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>, 5v/3v sus, etc., all present. Boards do not power on with battery or charger. Checked BIOS chips, swapped from good board to see if it improved things, and nothing.\n\nIs there anything else I need to check? Has anyone else had this issue and resolved it successfully? I've already checked the obvious culprits--<CHIP>U2800</CHIP>, shorts on <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, etc., and nothing changes it. ISL area is all good, of course, and my main rails are all present. Are these likely dead PCH/CPUs? Could it be a bad SMC? I really want to figure these boards out, and they all have the exact same symptoms.\n\nAny leads appreciated. I can provide specific measurements if needed, but I'm really asking more of a specific question as to whether or not anyone has solved a similar issue. I'm out of ideas of where to look, and I hate to use boards that should be repairable for parts boards."

Essentially the plan is to brick an S0 rail to find out if it still pulses or actually remains on.\n\nIve had similar symtoms to what your getting caused by <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> going bad before. No liquid.ect \n\nI find the fastest way to diagnose these strange issues is by breaking power rails one by one until you maybe get a fan spin. Work from the top backwards, By removing <SIGNAL>5V_S0</SIGNAL> you also remove <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, Which means you also remove <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> voltages.\n\nA board missing <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> will still spin up and stay on with missing power rails, I think whats happening is that something occurs after <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is causing it to turn back off.\n\n-Im going to look like an idiot if this doesn't get you anywhere ahaha."
