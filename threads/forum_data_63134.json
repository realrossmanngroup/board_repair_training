Please I really need help with this.\nCan't figure out the issue.\n\nHere I have an 820-01958 that came with no power.\nAfter my first diagnostics found U7800 getting very hot.\nThe voltage on the charger was 20v, varying from 2W to 3W and 0.200A.\n\nAfter replacing U7800 the voltages are.\nWith battery\n20.9V\n34.59W\n1.700A\nBut the voltage on the charger keeps cycling for a minute before it stays steady.\n\nAll these rails keep cycling for about 1 minute, then stays on.\nThe voltage on the charger port also keeps cycling,\n\nL9060 - PVCCSSD0_PHASE - 2.53V\nL7670 - PP5V_G3S - 5.10V\nL7690 - P3V3G3H - 3.29V\nL7030 - CHGR_PHASE1 - 12.7V\nL7400 - VCCINAUX_RTN - 1.82V\nL7230 - PPVCC_CPU_PH3 - 1.8V\nL7220 - CPUCORE_SW2 - 1.8V\nL7210 - CPUCORE_SW11.8V\nL8410 - PPVIN_SW_LCDBKLT_SW - 0V\nL8100 - P1V1_PHASE - 0.68V\n\nAll these rails keep cycling for about 1 minute, then stays on.\nThe voltage on the charger port also keeps cycling,\n\nI've tried to revive it in DFU and it goes all the process without problem, restarts, and shows the Lock sign on the other Mac.\n[URL='https:\/\/youtu.be\/veb8eK3Q5JE']Power Cycling video from USB-C charger[\/URL]"}
