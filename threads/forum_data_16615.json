            "message": "Hi, \n\nFirst post here so hello to all. :)\nI'm fairly new to repairs and trying to repair an 11\" 2011 air that is displaying the three beeps on powering up.\nIve watched Louis's vid in regards to reflowing the ram chips,  Im using Amtec flux, preheating the board to about 210 in the oven and then slowly heating the board with my gun and bringing up the heat to around 220.\nProblem I have is that I cant seem to get the ram chips to shuffle or \"dance\" as Louis put it to show that they have been successfully reflowed/solder melted. Ive even pushed the heat and air right up on my heat gun to over 350 but they still don't move at all. Anyone know what Im doing wrong or is my heatgun faulty? (Im using an AOYUE Int 852, pictured)  It is extremely hot so not sure if I'm missing something. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nSam"
