            "message": "Hi,\n\nI need some assistance in troubleshooting a <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> who doesn’t want to re install macOS through internet recovery. It gets all the way through than gives “ MacOS “Installation Failed, An Error Occurred While Installing”.\n\nLast week a friend of mine decided to factory reset his laptop as he doesn’t use it anymore and wanted to sell it. After factory resetting it and entering recovery mode (cmd+R) he followed the steps on the apple support community to delete the old install and reinstall by deleting the partition using disk utility but it failed saying “ MacOS “Installation Failed, An Error Occurred While Installing”. He then gave it to me to see if I can help him.\n\nI entered recovery and checking the disk utility logs in recovery mode you can see about 30 repeated attempts all with the same text and the error 478. I haven’t been able to find anything specific on that error code or what to do about it, just the usual stuff my friend followed on the support forums. Only extra thing I have done is reset the pram as one site suggested that and that has not helped, if anything made things worse as now it seems much slower.\n\nI have downloaded TransMac to create a bootable USB to try recover off as I currently do not have any other working macs to create a recovery usb on my windows pc. But the guides for it are not very detailed, they note formatting, setting it up for mac partitioning, extracting the macOS (I’ve downloaded Monterey as I wasn’t sure if Ventura is compatible), and that’s it. You’re supposed to be able to boot off of that but it does not show as a bootable device. I did not see any steps for actually setting the device as a bootable usb so have I missed some steps?\nI can provide the disk utility logs if needed, I didn’t upload them now as I’m at home.\n\nthanks again for your assistance."

I managed to get the Mojave installer as Mac world have an article with direct links for basically all the App Store pages so I was able to download it and install Mojave onto a usb.\n\nFor some reason creating the boot stick though did not work using the instructions on the above for mentioned mac world page, kept saying applications is an unknown command.\n\nI was able though to install direct to a usb than use recovery mode on the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. For some reason this time while using internet recovery it actually went through and installed instead of erroring. Not sure if it installed off the usb or internet but it works now so doesn’t matter I guess.\n\nit’s been wiped and I completed setup just so I could get into the os and make sure everything works. For future reference is there a way to skip to the os like windows has with OBE(out of box experience)? What do you think is most likely my friend did wrong to cause this issue in the first place? Because I’m basically going to have to do the same thing he did now, remove the user profile and return the Mac to out of box state so I want to do it correctly.\n\nThanks again for your assistance it is greatly appreciated!"
