Magsafe has light.\n\n\nNow have this reails:\n\nPPBUS is ok\n\nALL S5 and S4 reails are ok, except <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> ( It's generated from <CHIP>U8050</CHIP> that doesnt recieve <SIGNAL>SMC_SENSOR_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>, it's just pulsing from 0 to 3.4 every 2-3 seconds.V)\n\nDo you think it's SMC ?\n\n\nP.S: SOrry. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> is present and all sys pwr is pulsing every 2-3 seconds.\n\nAlready checked <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> again and it seems be ok.\n\nAlso checked SMC bypass and fan spins for half second and stops."
