Just once I've seen a short blink of white screen (with backlight) during chime - that's why I did not trash this board yet.\n\nWhen it came to me, LVDS (J9000) was a little bit damaged around LED RETURN pins - some of them were most likely shorted. Some screws were missing, but otherwise the board looks clean, no oxidation, no signs of previous repair attempts, no flux anywhere before I touched it. I tried different LCD assembly, no success.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.54V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.42V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S0</SIGNAL> 1.2V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0GPU</SIGNAL> 1.04V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0GPU</SIGNAL> 1.79V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0GPU</SIGNAL> 3.32V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_GPU</SIGNAL> 0.90V\n\n<SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> 0.00V (not shorted to GND, but not even pulsing after power on)\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> 3.1V\n\n<SIGNAL>GPU_RESET_R_L</SIGNAL> [U]0.00V[/U]\n<SIGNAL>EG_RESET_L</SIGNAL> [U]0.00V[/U]\nThese two should be high I think?\n\nAll measured with genuine 85W MagSafe, only powerboard and LCD connected.\n\nSo far I reballed <CHIP>U9600</CHIP>, reflowed <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and changed J9000, but it's still the same."
