At max volume, you still have to be ~6 inches from the speaker to hear anything. In addition, it sounds like it's lacking any and all bass\/mids (very tinny). I thought maybe there was a leaking or missing cap somewhere, but found nothing. Everything seems to measure properly, and there was no liquid damage. Super clean board. \n\nAny ideas? All measurements I took in the audio circuit seem normal. All help appreciated--thanks!"}

I believe the headphone jack works fine, but will check and confirm again to be sure."}

The high tones seem to work. Look on the scope if there is any input to all 4 amps. The startup chime will go through the bass speakers so that is probably missing too.\nCould also be low voltage to the analog section of U6201 or low voltage to the amps."}
