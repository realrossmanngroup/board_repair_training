No signs of corrosion, MB looks perfect.\nCustomer report that the machine works perfect yesterday evening, but this morning macbook won't turn on.\nCPU Vcore steady at 1.07v measured on L7210\/L7220 so no boot I guess.\n\nwith another bin came from this forum (filename \"A1706 820-00239-09 - clean.bin\") , Vcore stays at 0v.\nWhere should I start?\nThank you"}
