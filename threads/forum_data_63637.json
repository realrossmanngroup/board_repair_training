No signs of corrosion, MB looks perfect.\nCustomer report that the machine works perfect yesterday evening, but this morning macbook won't turn on.\nCPU Vcore steady at 1.07v measured on L7210/L7220 so no boot I guess.\n\nwith another bin came from this forum (filename \"<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00239</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-09 - clean.bin\") , Vcore stays at 0v.\nWhere should I start?\nThank you"
