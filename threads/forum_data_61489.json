After replacing affected components the board powers on to 20v at 0.12-0.14a\n\nStrange, can hear a buzzing noise coming out of the board. Sounds like it either coming from the T2 chip or U7800\n\nTried DFU mode revive option which completed successfully but no changes.\n\nWhat should be checked next??"}

Once unplugged and plugged back in buzzing noise returns within a few seconds"}
