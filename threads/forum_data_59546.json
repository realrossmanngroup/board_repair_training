        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

        "PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the backlight on the LCD screen, this is necessary to get the screen to light up..",
