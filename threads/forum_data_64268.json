            "message": "Hi guys.\n\nI have this Macbook <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> MB with an issue with not showing a picture every time, and it usually happens when the battery is plugged in. There was some corrosion on <CAPACITOR>C4905</CAPACITOR> together with <RESISTOR>R5076</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5075</RESISTOR>, but I took care of that and also on the <RESISTOR>R3655</RESISTOR> area but all resoldered. \n\nOnce I plug in the battery it won't show a picture, even with just the MB and LCD still doesn't show a picture, so I have to leave it for some time to drain and then it shows every time when just MB and LCD. I was suspecting <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> in the beginning, but now I'm not sure. <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> it's clean and no corrosion near it. I have also resoldered and checked all contacts on J9000.\n\nAny ideas? Thanks"

I solved it by turning off the GPU, to work only on the Intel, just the brightness it's stuck at 100%. \n\nThanks for the assistance"
