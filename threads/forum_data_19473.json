If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",

The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

Keyboard only works once trackpad disconnected and reconnected[/PLAIN]\n\nLiquid Damage. Someone cleaned it up before me so couldn't see where the spill was on board but there were red probe points on a lot of the <SIGNAL>WS_KBD</SIGNAL> points, below <CHIP>U5010</CHIP> area and below <CHIP>U4900</CHIP>. Came in originally with no trackpad or keyboard.\n\nReplaced:\n\n<CHIP>U5701</CHIP> and everything in surrounding area.\n<RESISTOR>R7803</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7803</RESISTOR> , <TRANSISTOR>Q7800</TRANSISTOR> (I had 1.7V on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> originally - now have 3.3V on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> is correct)\nJ5713\n<CHIP>U5805</CHIP> and surrounding components.\n<CHIP>U5010</CHIP> + <CHIP>U4900</CHIP>\n\nSymptoms now: no trackpad. Missing <SIGNAL>PP18V5_S4</SIGNAL> when trackpad connected. Keyboard doesn't work in OS mode when connected on its own.\n\nTo get keyboard to work you plug in the trackpad, boot the machine, then remove trackpad cabe on J5800. Keyboard will work fine. Before this the keyboard sort of works and you can just about hold ALT down and select boot device by pressing the arrow keys repeatedly. Once in OS mode no keyboard at all unless you do the remove trackpad cable trick.\n\nAnyone seen this before and can point me in the right direction? Have tried two different trackpads - same thing.\n\n<SIGNAL>Z2_BOOST_EN</SIGNAL> is missing.\n\nUSB mouse and keyboard work fine.\n\nThanks,\n\nJon"
