        "message":"[PLAIN][SOLVED]820-2915 No Trackpad. Keyboard only works once trackpad disconnected and reconnected[\/PLAIN]\n\nLiquid Damage. Someone cleaned it up before me so couldn't see where the spill was on board but there were red probe points on a lot of the WS_KBD points, below U5010 area and below U4900. Came in originally with no trackpad or keyboard.\n\nReplaced:\n\nU5701 and everything in surrounding area.\nR7803, R7803 , Q7800 (I had 1.7V on PP3V3_S4 originally - now have 3.3V on PP3V3_S4 is correct)\nJ5713\nU5805 and surrounding components.\nU5010 + U4900\n\nSymptoms now: no trackpad. Missing PP18V5_S4 when trackpad connected. Keyboard doesn't work in OS mode when connected on its own.\n\nTo get keyboard to work you plug in the trackpad, boot the machine, then remove trackpad cabe on J5800. Keyboard will work fine. Before this the keyboard sort of works and you can just about hold ALT down and select boot device by pressing the arrow keys repeatedly. Once in OS mode no keyboard at all unless you do the remove trackpad cable trick.\n\nAnyone seen this before and can point me in the right direction? Have tried two different trackpads - same thing.\n\nZ2_BOOST_EN is missing.\n\nUSB mouse and keyboard work fine.\n\nThanks,\n\nJon"
