        "message":"Magsafe light is on. No fan. 3v42 is stable. PPBUS_G3H is stable. 3V3 and 5V are all jumping up slightly - S5, S3 and S0. Continual pulsing on L7520. No signs of life on CPU VCORE when plugging it in - no voltage pulse at all. Checked all the SPI ROM data lines. U1950 looks good and is getting stable 3V42 on pin 8. Any thoughts on where to go next?"

It's hitting 3.3V and then dropping right down.\n\nAs far as the liquid damage, you might want to look at the pics. It's kind of spread around. Louis fixed the image upload so they're good now."
