This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen.",
        "SMC_LID_RIGHT": "What is SMC_LID_RIGHT? SMC_LID_RIGHT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the right LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_RIGHT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

Computer wasn't booting due short (<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> on J4810). Found it, replaced both connector, now it starts and work normal untill u sleep it. After that image desappear. I can still clicking sound of up/down volume but here is no image ( can see it on external display, not always, sometimes image disappear on both displays)\n\n\nThe only way to boot it with his displays and working (untill sleep it again\" is disconnect-connect battery and plug charger than i will start, and will charge the battery all will be ok. I also tried to just start from battery but it doesnt work too. \n\n\nAny idea?"
