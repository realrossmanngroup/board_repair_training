        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",

Physical examination revealed corrosion on <CAPACITOR>C5002</CAPACITOR>.\nAfter replacing <CAPACITOR>C5002</CAPACITOR>, I got USB activity and only with a screen connected booted up fine to the flashing question mark.\n\nI put the board in a case, connected cables and added an SSD; no boot. Green/orange, fan spin, nothing else.\nI removed everything one by one hoping to pinpoint the issue but the bare board alone is no longer booting (no USB activity).\n\nSMC bypass does not make any changes.\n\nDon't remember if it is the normal behaviour but upon connecting the power fan spins for about 5-6 seconds, then stops for 1-2 seconds and starts again. It does this just once, not repeated reboots.\n\nCarefully examined the rest of the board for liquid damage however it is very clean with no obvious issues.\n\nAre there any clues above indicating what might be the next problem? I am not sure where to go next.\n\nEDIT:\nPPBUS 8.6V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is 1.8V \n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> 3.3v\n\nThanks"

I suspected that the alcohol went under the SMC as well and perhaps relocated some of the dirt that was already parked there. I Reflown the SMC and now everything is working back again. Lesson learned.\n\nThanks for the help."
