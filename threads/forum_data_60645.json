I have 20V @ 40mA on my USB-C ammeter and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.62V and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is present at 3.3V. I know since i have 20V at the charger the USB-C controllers are ok, and I have my G3H rails, I don't think my ISL is bad that probably has nothing to do with it I not sure what to look at next."
