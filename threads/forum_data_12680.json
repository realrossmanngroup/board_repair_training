After that it was fine for a couple of days but then the display started flickering.\n\nWhen I got this in the shop I completely disassembled it, even taking the keyboard out (all 67 screws). There is absolutely no signs of residue, corrosion, rust, or any other exposure to liquid. I even looked closely under the scope. I have now reassembled it and it has the same flickering of backlight (verified with flash light). The flicker is not present when testing with external display, and the intermittent flicker seems to be triggered when connecting the charger (green light present, and changes to orange like normal). The flicker does not occur while in Apple Hardware Test unless the charger is connected. And or course the hardware test found no issues. As always thanks for any guidance."

Also the backlight goes completely out when the charger is connected. If you connect\/disconnect the charger repeatedly the backlight will come back on but continues to flicker intermittently all the way off, the back on, but mostly staying off unless I start repeatedly start connecting\/disconnecting the charger again.\n\nAnother note is that the only thing that can make the backlight come back on when it goes off (while the having the charger connected) is to wiggle the charger connector at the DC in jack or disconnect charger completely... then the backlight comes right back on."
