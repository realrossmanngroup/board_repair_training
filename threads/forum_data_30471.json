        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "SMC_LSOC_RST_L": "What is SMC_LSOC_RST_L? SMC_LSOC_RST_L is a signal that comes out of the trackpad on Macbook Airs that can reset the SMC.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v..",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. ."

            "message": "Hello everyone, hello Louis\ni started to work in a local repair shop and i'm trying to learn [SUB]rocket science[/SUB] board repair\n\n2012 Macbook air <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>\nfirst condition:\nliquid damage (coffee)\ndoes not power on, orange light goes to green when the power button is pressed.\nthere is no actual liquid damage on the logic board, small spot on the touchpad board, few marks on the power board and absolutely zero sign of corrosion.\n\nsecond condition:\nafter unplugging the battery laptop works normally as if it was just repaired and Louis is happy: charger without the battery turns it on, the fan is spinning(also goes straight to boot and chimes)\nafter plugging battery back, turns only if the charger is also connected. once started, boots normally, battery charges, etc.(* the only \"strange\" thing is that i gave a short fan blast, then 2 seconds and then it goes on, but i'm not sure if it is normal or not).\n\n- if I use software shutdown from the booted OsX, goes back to the first dead condition with an orange->green light switching on power button but no fan and no fun.\n- if I hard shutdown from the second condition OR shutdown from the login screen, it goes back to the second condition: power on only with charger.\nSMC/NVRAM reset makes no difference, there's no actual liquid damage on the board.\n\ncould someone throw some hints? I do not have much experience, and i guess it will take some time for me to check all corresponding rails but i will try to do it first thing tomorrow morning.\ni'm wild-guessing that it's missing some kind of a signal which tells SMC that battery is present/charged, but board schematics looks a little bit hard for me at my stage so i'm asking for a little guidance here."

New touchpad fixed the issue like a charm. \n It was confirmed liquid damage (literally, one drop of coffee). function keys work properly, but this is so typical for Apple with two types of trackpad/kbd controller for the same exact model :)\n\n\nalso, for anyone who reads this for education:\nIn this video, Louis talks about power button circuit and also shows how to test it with a multimeter\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg69WwtEdZQ&t=910s[/url]"
