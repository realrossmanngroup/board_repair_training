It will cause the charger to see no load and as a result output no voltage. \n\n1) What is PPDCIN_G3H?\n2) What voltage is on pin 1 and 2 of R6990 with charger plugged in?\n3) What voltage is on pin 2 and 3 of D6990 with charger plugged in?\n4) IF voltage is high on pin 2 of D6990 but low on pin 3 of D6990, what is the resistance to ground on pin 3 of D6990? Make this measurement without power plugged in. \n5) IF voltage is low on PPDCIN_G3H, around 0.2v, is there a short circuit to ground on PPDCIN_G3H? If not, replace IRF9395TRPBF\/Q7080."}
