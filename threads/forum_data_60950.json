        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWGD? This is a typo of ALL_SYS_PWRGD. When you see ALL_SYS_PWGD, assume they meant to type ALL_SYS_PWRGD.",

        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "P3V3S0_EN": "What is P3V3S0_EN? This signal enables the PP3V3_S0 power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
