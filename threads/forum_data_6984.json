            "message": "<TRANSISTOR>Q6920</TRANSISTOR> is going to let the SMC talk to the DC in board. In order for <TRANSISTOR>Q6920</TRANSISTOR> to let this occur, being an N channel MOSFET, you want equal or higher voltage on the gate than on the source, so you want voltage to be there.\n\nWhat places voltage on <TRANSISTOR>Q6920</TRANSISTOR>? The voltage divider of <RESISTOR>R6917</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R6918</RESISTOR>. It'll lower the 16v from the charger to something like 8-9v. This is when all is working as it should. So, with a known good DC in board, measure pin 2/5 of <TRANSISTOR>Q6920</TRANSISTOR>. Do you get 8-9v? Then this part of the circuit is doing its job - go away and check the SMC. Is <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> present? <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is required for the SMC to turn on. Is the SMC turning on? <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is required for the SMC to turn on.\n\nIf you do not have 8-9v on pins 2/5 of <TRANSISTOR>Q6920</TRANSISTOR>, then we have a problem with the onewire circuit. So let's take a look and walk through this clusterfuck of a mess, because it is intimidating if you are used to the newer onewire circuit.\n\nIt all begins at <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Look at <RESISTOR>R7010</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7011</RESISTOR> - this voltage divider takes the 16v from the charger and turns it into 4v for the <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> pin of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. When <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> has 4v, it allows <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL> to remain at a high voltage. <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL> is pulled up by <RESISTOR>R5087</RESISTOR>, and can be pulled down by <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> if something isn't right. If <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> is coming into <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, and you have <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL> on output, then we're 90% of the way there. Occasionally <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> will pull down <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL> if current sensing circuit is not working, such as resistance between pins 17/18 being over 4 ohms or resistance between pins 27/28 being over 21 ohms, but that is not likely here. We can move on and check other things.\n\nIf <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL> is present, let's go back to the onewire circuit, where they call it <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL>. Remember <TRANSISTOR>Q6910</TRANSISTOR>, which we need to open to send charger power to the onewire circuit? This is a P channel MOSFET, which will open when the voltage on the gate is lower than the source. So let's see... <RESISTOR>R6911</RESISTOR> takes the charger voltage and puts it straight on the gate. Gah, this will never open now! We have 16v on the source [I]and[/I] the gate! However, <RESISTOR>R6912</RESISTOR> turns this circuit into a [I]voltage divider![/I] When <RESISTOR>R6912</RESISTOR> has a path to ground, it will [I]lower [/I]the voltage on the gate of <TRANSISTOR>Q6910</TRANSISTOR>!\n\nWhat gives <RESISTOR>R6912</RESISTOR> a path to ground? <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR>. <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR> is an N channel MOSFET[I](dual, actually, there's 2 transistors inside one package)[/I], which will open when the voltage on the gate is higher than the source. So let's check pins 1 and 2 of <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR>. Pin 1 is ground(0v). Pin 2 is <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> - so as long as <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is higher than 2v or so, it will open and allow our <RESISTOR>R6911</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R6912</RESISTOR> voltage divider to work, which will allow <TRANSISTOR>Q6910</TRANSISTOR> to pass power through.\n\n[B]COMMON FAULT: <TRANSISTOR>Q6910</TRANSISTOR> fails internally and shorts pins 1/2 together, which fucks up the voltage divider. [/B]Check resistance between pins 1 & 2 of <TRANSISTOR>Q6910</TRANSISTOR>, if you get anything lower than 400kohms it's fucked. 250 ohms is common measurement for a fucked <TRANSISTOR>Q6910</TRANSISTOR>.\n\nNow, if this is all checking out so far, let's go over to <RESISTOR>R6917</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R6918</RESISTOR>. This voltage divider has a path to ground, by default, no transistor required to give it a path to ground like <RESISTOR>R6912</RESISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR>. At pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R6917</RESISTOR> is the output of this voltage divider which should dump 8-9v into <TRANSISTOR>Q6920</TRANSISTOR>'s gate and allow it to open. This is simple and straightforward. Do you have 8-9v here? If you do, check everything I stated in the beginning about SMC/<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>. If you [I]DON'T [/I]have anything here, then I want you to answer this question for me: what can take away the voltage from <RESISTOR>R6917</RESISTOR> and send it to ground? No, not a bad <RESISTOR>R6917</RESISTOR>.. that is never the case. You're welcome to measure to confirm. ;)\n\nLook around, follow the lines... yes, <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR>! <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR>, our N channel MOSFET, provides a direct path from <RESISTOR>R6917</RESISTOR> to ground, from pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR> to pin 4. If pin 5, the gate, of <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR> has a high voltage on it, it will send <SIGNAL>ONEWIRE_EN</SIGNAL> directly to ground. What causes this? Usually a fucked up <CHIP>U6915</CHIP> from someone plugging the charger in and touching wrong contacts somewhere.\n\nYou will have to go through and troubleshoot this to figure out what is actually wrong."
