        "message":"I have a 2012 A1278 that Very intermittently will have flickering lines across the screen and sometimes may freeze. Customer says that it happens very quickly and randomly. I myself however didn't experience it until I tilted it backwards from under trackpad. I thought it could be an LCD cable but it doesn't seem to occur when opening and closing the lid. I found that it was mostly happening if I tap fairly hard on the palmrest at either side of trackpad. I thought I had it narrowed down to bottom RAM slot and noticed that the screws attaching that RAM bracket were loose. I tightened them and thought things were all good. It is however back in shop with same complaint and I cant seem to recreate the problem. Any suggestions? As always... Thanks in advance."
