After that it tries to install something and aborts it.\n\nI somehow managed it to boot into MacOS via Holding down Shift left. Then the Macbook started to let me go trough the \"first installation cycle\". It was VERY slow. And by VERY slow i mean VERY VERY slow. After first installation and adding user and stuff i noticed that the TouchBar did not work.\n\nCould you give me some advice what to do next ?\n\nGreetings and many Thanks in Advance !"
