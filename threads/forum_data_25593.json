Simple enough repair, order a new fan, etc. Still no fan on power up however fan works in another MacBook. After testing the fan socket there is no data coming from SMC_FAN_RT_PWM.\n\nVoltage Readings:\n\nPin 1: 5.01 V\nPin 2: 0.004 V\nPin 3: 0 V\nPin 4: 3.34 V\nPin 5: 0 V\n\nR6061 is 99.9 K Ohm\n\nQ6060 has 3.30 V on Pin 1, 0.004 V on Pin 2, 0.004 V Pin 3.\n\nPossibly an SMC issue?"}
