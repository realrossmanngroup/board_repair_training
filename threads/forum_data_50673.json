    "definitions": {
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PM_DSW_PWRGD": "What is PM_DSW_PWRGD? The \"PM_DSW_PWRGD\" signal in a MacBook stands for \"Deep Sleep Well Power Good” and is required for the machine to power on & post..",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "SMC_TCK": "What is SMC_TCK? SMC_TCK is a signal that must be pulled up to 3.42v in order for the SMC to be in the proper mode to function. Often this is not pulled up because of corrosion or corroded resistors by the SMC. .",
        "SMC_TDI": "What is SMC_TDI? SMC_TDI is a signal that must be pulled up to 3.42v in order for the SMC to be in the proper mode to function. Often this is not pulled up because of corrosion or corroded resistors by the SMC. .",
        "PPVRTC_GH": "What is PPVRTC_GH? a SIGNAL.",
        "R1451": "What is R1451? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN": "What is SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN? a SIGNAL."
