        "message":"The MacBook was working fine, but then it seemed like the battery was dying fast, almost suddenly, then it just stopped turning on.  The guy that owns it did a battery replacementI, but had no luck getting it running. After opening it up I noticed the lock clip missing from the battery connector on the battery controller board and the flex cable was just sitting there. I fixed the connector and the battery is now working, although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s charging or simply running off the power that was in it from out of the box. I get 20 volts but once the amps ramp up to 0.72, then zero out and start again. In a loop. It does not power up. I only see one big coil get warm under thermal cam, but not hot. Any ideas?"

A friend told him that would fix it. He took it to Apple and they said it needed a new logic board of course. In the attached image you can see L7030 and the T2 are the only components getting warm."

I had checked the diode mode to ground on all big coils, including the small ones corresponding to SDD, but wasn't sure exactly what the readings should be. I get some of the small ones that are 4.11 and some that are 0.11. The big ones seem to be higher numbers. I am pretty sure that I should have CPU power even while the board is out and just using the 87w charger, but the CPU rails are missing. Is there anywhere I can safely inject voltage or something to look for a short. Unfortunately I'm running out of time with this one."
