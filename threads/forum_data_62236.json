The CPU doesn't get hot, and that happend even with just the board connected on the bench.\n\nWhen it reaches the login screen, sometimes it freazes after inserting the password, and other times it reboots after inserting password.\n\nAlready tried SMC reset and Pram reset but same result.\n\nEven without the disk, the fan behavier is the same, but it stays in question mark for ever.\n\nIt looks like some bad sensor (not sure), but i can't see anything wrong on the board. The Apple diagnostics shows no erros.\n\nCan you help?"}
