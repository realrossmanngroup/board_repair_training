Any help would be awesome!"}

Inspect the LCD cable closely as many times it has burned between the backlight pin and AUX pin. This will also have destroyed the connector on the board or LCD.\n\nDid you use a CBTL type MUX? On some 3787 board alternate part numbers were used and they may not work. Make sure it says 6142 on the MUX."}
