Works 100% other than these key problems. I haven't dived into the caps lock led yet. Just the three keys that don't work. I'm focusing right now on U6703 for these three. There's 3.3v coming in on pin 10. Pins 1-3 KBD_RIGHT_SHIFT_KEY, KBD_LEFT_OPTION_KEY, KBD_CONTROL_KEY all have zero volts. Pins 7-9 each has 1.8v. Pin 4 has 1.8, and pin 6 has zero volts. On a whim I replaced U6703 and same results. What's the distinction between   KBD_RIGHT_SHIFT_KEY    and     KBD_RIGHT_SHIFT_L  ?"}
