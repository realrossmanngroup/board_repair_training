I haven't dived into the caps lock led yet. Just the three keys that don't work. I'm focusing right now on <CHIP>U6703</CHIP> for these three. There's 3.3v coming in on pin 10. Pins 1-3 <SIGNAL>KBD_RIGHT_SHIFT_KEY</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>KBD_LEFT_OPTION_KEY</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>KBD_CONTROL_KEY</SIGNAL> all have zero volts. Pins 7-9 each has 1.8v.
