            "message": "Hi,\n\nI'm new to the T2 chip Macs. I had a water damage come in and had 5v on the charger.  Got <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> working by replacing chips C03215. I was then getting 19.8V on the charger. I was only getting 1.8V on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> though. I was looking for something similiar to <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP> like on Macbook Pro's but the only thing I found was a chip that looked like it was creating <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. This was <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. (i could be totally wrong) So I thought I'd reflow <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and after I was getting 12.4v on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. Then after 30 seconds the charger went down to 5v again. And my <SIGNAL>PPBUS_GH</SIGNAL> went down to 1.7v. One thing that is bothering me is that <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> will \"tone\" short to ground for a few seconds then it won't. Could this be a chip failure. Is that something that happens? Like a chip will short and then it won't so it \"tone\"s short to ground and then doesn't?\n\nI'm wondering where to look next. What makes <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> on this board? What makes <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and I'd like to figure out the order of what comes first. I see a couple of videos by Louis but they are for the MBP. Thank you for any direction. Right now I'm back at 5v on charger again.\n\n[B]Recap:[/B]\n\n[U][B]Started at:[/B][/U]\n\n5v on charger\n0v <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>\n\n[U][B]Replaced C03215 chip:[/B][/U]\n\n19.7v on charger\n3.4v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>\n1.7 on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>\n\n[U][B]Reflowed U700(0?):[/B][/U]\n\n19.8v on charger\n3.4v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>\n12.7 on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>\n\n[U][B]then it took a shit.

            "message": "Thank you.  There really wasn't too much water damage and it was localized.  After replacing <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> (both) I was able to get 19.8v.  But <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was at 1.7v.  Then I reflowed <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and it got me <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> for about 30 seconds.  Please verify my thinking. If <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> (<CHIP>ISL9240</CHIP>) is bad then I think that <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> and <CHIP>U6960</CHIP> will not enable and not give me PPBUS or 3V3.  So maybe next time I'll look at <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> first. \n\nFor diode and ohm I do wait awhile after powering down before testing. One weird thing is for <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> when I test the same CAP but switch sides (positive/negative) with my probes it will \"tone\" every time I switch.  Wonder what that's all about?  Thx for the advice!"
