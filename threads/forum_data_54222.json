I  replaced the U7000, the typical ISL in these. turned on. alright i reassemble but now the machine wont detect battery. the two  things were the battery screws go were broken so i resoldered them. but the battery isnt detected im thinking ?ts a screwed battery, but i want to make sure before making my customer buy new one. ive checked both data lines, and that the two battery screws are properly attached, so it isnt the special screw. i get 1-2v at pin 5 of Q7055. but the on the data lines on battery only i get 0V, but when i put charger in, i get proper volts at the data lines. so its just a screwed battery, or it may be related to the SMC, or U7000?"}
