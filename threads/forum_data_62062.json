I replaced the trackpad with a known good one, and a new flex cable too.\nNow keyboard works, and trackpad works, only it doesn't provide any force feedback, which makes it feel very weird to use.\n\nOther things I noticed: CB700 was blown, it probably shorted internally and burnt down. I removed it but it was probably already dead open after burning. It is just a cap on PPBUS though, so I don't see how that would affect the trackpad force feedback while the rest of the machine works just fine.\n\nAnyone has encountered issue with trackpad force feedback before ? I'm not quite sure where to look at since I'd expect this to be fully contained within the trackpad, but I've got it tested in another machine and it works fine.\n\nAnd of course, I've already tried PRAM reset, SMC reset, and the option in Trackpad settings in MacOS is properly turned on."}

The fuse is good.\nPPBUS_G3H is only 11.2V. Isn't that too low ? I don't have a reference for this machine. But really other than the touchpad feedback, this machine works just fine, so I assumed it wouldn't be a bad PPBUS, but maybe it is after all ?"}
