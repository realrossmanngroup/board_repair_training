But once you closed the lid (system goes to sleep, fan is off) and leave it closed overnight, by mid-day the next day, the battery is fully drained. Once, I check it when the lid was closed for a couple of hours and the boards was warm (fan wasn't running). No sure where to start from on this one as there are no corrosion on this board, board looks very clean. I'm about to order a usb-c to MagSafe 2 cable so that I connect it to my usb-c power meter monitor to see if the board is still pulling a lot current when it's off or when in sleep mode. But until i get that part, any suggestions on things to check?"
