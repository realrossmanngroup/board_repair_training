        "message":"Hello, i have a 820-3435 wich doesnt turn on with the power button (you need to unplug the battery and connect the charger for it to turn on, or short the 2 turn on pads).\n\nI dont see corrosion anywhere on the board, but there is no continuity from Pin 20 of J4800 to R5116. There is continuity on the rest of the rail up to the SMC. \n\nShould  i solder a wire from pin 20 to R5116? Thank you."
