So I put it back in the machine and sure enough it worked fine.\nExcept for not detecting a battery, I couldnt see any corrosion on the board despite this being milk damaged. So I decided to ultrasonic it.\n\nNow the machine boots but gets stuck on apple loading screen, but if i press capslock it lights up and if i press other keys it makes that beep noise.\n\nSo seems like the machine is booting but display is getting stuck on the apple boot logo?\n\nResoldered <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> no change in results."
