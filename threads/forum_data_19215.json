So I put it back in the machine and sure enough it worked fine.\nExcept for not detecting a battery, I couldnt see any corrosion on the board despite this being milk damaged. So I decided to ultrasonic it.\n\nNow the machine boots but gets stuck on apple loading screen, but if i press capslock it lights up and if i press other keys it makes that beep noise.\n\nSo seems like the machine is booting but display is getting stuck on the apple boot logo?\n\nResoldered u8900 no change in results."}

Only thing to do is look where the corrosion was and find the corroded trace\/resistor. Maybe crap under a chip too."}

Was only a dead SMC to start, but idiots came before me and fucked with the GPU. Redid the GPU and VRAM and now it boots up fine again. Quite a pain in the ass to do the VRAM on these I must warn with tight clearance to parts and glue."}
