        "message":"I got this 17\" 2011 MBP sent from another repair shop with this note.\n\"Magsafe adapter fades to black after a few seconds and the device won't power on. Tried SMC bypass with no luck. Replaced dc board but still the same symptoms\"\n\nWhen I initially plugged in my charger the fans started spinning and the magsafe light was bright green. After a second or two the fans stopped spinning then they spun again and the machine chimed and booted and I was able to login and play with a few things like internet and camera. The battery was charging then all of a sudden it stopped charging and the magsafe light went dim and soon after it shut down and I haven't been able to get it back on.\n\nI am using a genuine Apple 85w charger.\n\nI've tried plugging in 2 other 820-2565 magsafe boards(not sure if there compatible) and still the light is dim green.\nWhen I take a look at the logic board I can see discolored probe points as if there was liquid damage that got cleaned up. Some by the SMC(U4900)\n\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.45v'\nSMC_RESET_L - fluctuates quickly between 2.9v to 3.4v\nPPBUS_G3H - 0.48v (With battery and charger plugged in 10.4v)\nPins1\/2 of U6901(SMC_BC_ACOK) - 0v\nPin 5 U6900 (Adapter Sense) - 0v\n\nPins 19\/20 of U7000 (VDD Pins) - 2.5v (R7001 measured proper resistance)\nResistance Pins 17\/18 - 3.6ohms - Pins 27\/28 - 21ohms\n\nShouldn't that be 5.1v and where is it created? I believe in the newer schematics that is created by the 3v42 circuit"
