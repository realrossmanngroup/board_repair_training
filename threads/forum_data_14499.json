    "definitions": {
        "820-2914": "What is 820-2914? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U6900": "What is U6900? a CHIP.",
        "U6901": "What is U6901? a CHIP.",
        "U4900": "What is U4900? This is the System Management Controller(SMC) in older(pre-2013) macbooks.",
        "820-2565": "What is 820-2565? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "R7001": "What is R7001? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. ."

Tried SMC bypass with no luck. Replaced dc board but still the same symptoms\"\n\nWhen I initially plugged in my charger the fans started spinning and the magsafe light was bright green. After a second or two the fans stopped spinning then they spun again and the machine chimed and booted and I was able to login and play with a few things like internet and camera. The battery was charging then all of a sudden it stopped charging and the magsafe light went dim and soon after it shut down and I haven't been able to get it back on.\n\nI am using a genuine Apple 85w charger.\n\nI've tried plugging in 2 other <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2565</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> magsafe boards(not sure if there compatible) and still the light is dim green.\nWhen I take a look at the logic board I can see discolored probe points as if there was liquid damage that got cleaned up. Some by the SMC(<CHIP>U4900</CHIP>)\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.45v'\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - fluctuates quickly between 2.9v to 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 0.48v (With battery and charger plugged in 10.4v)\nPins1/2 of <CHIP>U6901</CHIP>(<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL>) - 0v\nPin 5 <CHIP>U6900</CHIP> (Adapter Sense) - 0v\n\nPins 19/20 of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> (VDD Pins) - 2.5v (<RESISTOR>R7001</RESISTOR> measured proper resistance)\nResistance Pins 17/18 - 3.6ohms - Pins 27/28 - 21ohms\n\nShouldn't that be 5.1v and where is it created? I believe in the newer schematics that is created by the 3v42 circuit"
