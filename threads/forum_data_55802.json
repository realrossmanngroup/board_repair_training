I confirmed with another type-c mac running mojave 10.14.6 and Apple Configurator 2, got a dfu icon when plugged into \"front left\" type-c.  Did \"restore\" and got an error (AMRestoreErrorDomain error 10....) which is apparently just a generic error about the write process.\n\nBad mac apparently power cycled, and is now charging the battery (20v \/ 3A draw) and responds to click but still has black screen.  I'll continue toying with DFU\/bridge bios installing\/wiping etc... but i've done this 3 times now and it's failed 3 times (different error message once, said it's booted to recovery mode instead of DFU)"
