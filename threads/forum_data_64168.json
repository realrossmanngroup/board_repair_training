Thanks.\n\nEdit: CB304 is now out of the board,it looks like I perhaps broke it while trying to measure <SIGNAL>1V1_LDO_BMC</SIGNAL>. Can't solder it back in place.\nI measured it, 1.12uF. If I can measure it, I don't understand why I can't put it back in place.\n\nEdit: I found a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-1958</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> (MAcBook Air 2020) donor board, took the <CAPACITOR>C2830</CAPACITOR>, schematics shows 2.2uF, measured it, 0.3nF...going to pick them all one by one and test as I do not have any 2018 MacBook Pro donor board\nMight be luckier if I pick one on the same part of the circuitry xD\n\nEdit: <CAPACITOR>C3206</CAPACITOR>, 1.03uF, but 6.3V; <CAPACITOR>C4423</CAPACITOR>, 2.1uF, 4V\nLooks like I ripped off the pad of CB304, will scratch the surface to solder on the trace\n\nI replaced the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>;\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]UB300[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]{}=TA[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP1V8_UPC_{}_LDOD[/TD]\n[TD]0.44V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP1V1_UPC_{}_LDO_BMC[/TD]\n[TD]0.455V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_UPC_{}_LDO[/TD]\n[TD]0.355V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP1V8_UPC_{}_LDOA[/TD]\n[TD]0.478V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]USBC_{}_CC1[/TD]\n[TD]0.542V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]USBC_{}_CC2[/TD]\n[TD]0.543V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n<SIGNAL>1V1_UPC_TA_LDO_BMC</SIGNAL> is now in line.
