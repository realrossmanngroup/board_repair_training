We tried 2 different LCDs and neither worked.  We reinstall the old LCD and backlight and scrambled image is there.  Has anyone seen anything like this before??? I know there is a difference between 2015 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> LCD and 2012-2014 LCDs.  But is there different models for the 2012-2014?? We have replaced these before and never experienced this issue??"
