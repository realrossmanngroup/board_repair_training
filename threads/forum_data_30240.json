It is missing ALL_SYS_PWRGD, All power rails required for ALL_SYS_PWRGD are present \nHowever PP1v05_S0 is lower than it should be. it is only making 0.95V for some reason. I have replaced the feedback resistors and the IC. checked all resistors and i cant figure out why its output is lower than a known good board!"

Is 1V05 resistance to GND low?[\/QUOTE]\n\nIt is not low resistance to GND.\n\nI have had ALL_SYS_PWRGD come up a couple times after messing around (and even got 1v05 up at some point temporarily) but it seems to be related to the heat of replacing random components. When 1v05 came up so did ALL_SYS_PWRGD, but it never actually posted. The current draw was doing wierd stuff, fan would start-stop, start, current would stick at 0.3A with all rails, then after 20 seconds would jump to 0.55A and then 0.7a and back down to 0.55\n\nIm not even sure what it was i did to get the 1v05 up correctly but its gone since i cleaned the flux off properly. Im stumped."
