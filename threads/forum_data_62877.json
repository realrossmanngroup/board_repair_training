Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

            "message": "Hello,\n\n I have a 2010 15\" Macbook Pro that was experiencing random shutdowns and reboots during use. It has progressed to the point where it doesn't even boot into recovery mode or display anything on the screen when powering on. When the charger is plugged in it is green and when the power button is pressed the screen remains black but the fans start up with no chime noise. I've tried removing the RAM to see if I could get it to beep at me but nothing beeps or makes noise with the RAM or SSD removed. \n\n I initially thought it was the kernel panic issue tied to the tantalum capacitor near the GPU so I swapped it out with a new polymer capacitor but the issue still persists exactly the same.\n\nI have provided a gallery of photos of the board back and front and up close near each section of the board:\n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://postimg.cc/gallery/ktfD9hQ[/URL]\n\nI am new to this so I have not done anything else outside of what I mentioned here. I also just subscribed to the repair forum subscription as well.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!"
