Before that i had a trackpad issue with it and tested the trackpad and found out that it was shorter to ground and because of that it did not start. After replacing the trackpad with a new one it started to work but now the fan spins full speed and the keyboard itself pushes buttons. Some of them work just fine like volume buttons and other keyboards. What could be the issue here, its weird in first place that the trackpad is shorted to ground."

Usually it will get slow when there is a sensor problem but the Macbook works just fine and there is no lagging in it. The fan just runs really fast and the keyboard presses buttons by itself. I checked the board if there were any corrosions or any sign of water damage but there were nothing. I will run ASD when i get the ASD file."

TS0P is trackpad temp sensor. Having spares of all these parts around will save you lots of misery going forward."

No errors on ASD neither EFI."
