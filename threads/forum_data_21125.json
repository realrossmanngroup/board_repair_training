            "message": "Hi guys,\n\n\nThis one works normally without the battery and also works normally when the battery is connected. BUT when the battery is connected and you plugin the magsafe the green light trembles and switches off. You must remove the magsafe from the AC outlet to start it again because it has detected a short.\n\nI tried all the usual suspects to no avail.\n\n\na) <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> was replaced.\n\nb) All surrounding resistors were measured OK => IMPORTANT NOTE: <RESISTOR>R7015</RESISTOR> was measuring 55K in-circuit (instead of 220K) but was the SAME ALSO OFF-CIRCUIT. So I placed a new 220K in its place and now it is measuring 220K IN-CIRCUIT (this was a question of another user in another topic and Louis said its because the resistor is in-circuit but probably this one is measuring right)! nothing changed.\n\nc) <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> was found to be \"always open\" or shorted between S & D and was replaced. nothing changed.\n\nd) <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> & <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> were also replaced incase there were not driven properly by their Gates.\n\ne) new battery and original 85W magsafe used.\n\n\nAt this point I could use some insight from the gurus.\n\nbr,\ngeorge"
