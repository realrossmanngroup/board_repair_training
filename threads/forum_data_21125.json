BUT when the battery is connected and you plugin the magsafe the green light trembles and switches off. You must remove the magsafe from the AC outlet to start it again because it has detected a short.\n\nI tried all the usual suspects to no avail.\n\n\na) U7000 was replaced.\n\nb) All surrounding resistors were measured OK => IMPORTANT NOTE: R7015 was measuring 55K in-circuit (instead of 220K) but was the SAME ALSO OFF-CIRCUIT. So I placed a new 220K in its place and now it is measuring 220K IN-CIRCUIT (this was a question of another user in another topic and Louis said its because the resistor is in-circuit but probably this one is measuring right)! nothing changed.\n\nc) Q7055 was found to be \"always open\" or shorted between S & D and was replaced. nothing changed.\n\nd) Q7080 & Q7085 were also replaced incase there were not driven properly by their Gates.\n\ne) new battery and original 85W magsafe used.\n\n\nAt this point I could use some insight from the gurus.\n\nbr,\ngeorge"}

What was tricky I think in your case, is that the board worked with ppdcin on ppbus_g3h. Usually when the fan spins we don't give a shit about PPBUS_G3H :)\nSo I learned that a board at least 820-2850 could work with PPDCIN shorted to PPBUS without battery.\nHope your battery and  sense resistors are still ok."}

Everything is great so far. thank you again buddy."}
