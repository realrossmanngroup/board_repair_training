        "D7050": "What is D7050? Diodes between SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL and ground, these data lines allow the battery to communicate with the battery charging chip and the SMC..",

It still boots to OS, but it's not detecting the battery. <SIGNAL>SMBUS_BATT_SCL</SIGNAL> measures 0.4 ohms to ground. <RESISTOR>R5381</RESISTOR> measures 2000 Ohms from the PP3v42 side. I already replaced <DIODE>D7050</DIODE>, but the short is still there. the only other termination points i can find in the schematic are on <CHIP>U5000</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>. Is there a way to tell if its <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> other than replacing it? or could the short be somewhere else still?"

            "message": "I am returning to this one for a less clear issue. After re-assembling the machine and final testing it turns out the machine is running throttled. Self-diagnostics of the machine give error PPF004, issues with the fan.\nturning it to maximum using macs fan control shows that it is only running at 5700 rpm maximum. after replacing resistors <RESISTOR>R6060</RESISTOR> i am getting 6100 rpm max with a known good fan, only 100 rpm off what it is supposed to be. The machine is still running throttled.\n\nWhen the fan is off <TRANSISTOR>Q6060</TRANSISTOR> measures\npin 1: 3.3 V\npin 2: 0v\npin 3: 0v\n\nwhen hte fan is on full\npin 1: 3.3v\npin 2: 3,4v\npin 3: 5.05v\n\nResistance to ground on <SIGNAL>SMC_FAN_0_TACH</SIGNAL> is 103.4 Ohms\n\nis there any way to check is this is the actual cause of the problem? and also any way to maybe artificially squeeze out a little more rpm is this if the problem? I suspect the problem is not with the actual rpm of the fan, but the measured rpm value, so maybe changing the reistance on one of the voltage divider resistors a little might fix this?"
