            "message": "As the title says, I have a 3435 Air board that has no power button functionality but all other keys work. Followed back from keyboard connector to the SMC Reset circuit and I'm assuming this is where the problem lies. This board was very lightly water damaged but has been cleaned and this is the only remaining symptom. As of right now I have 3.4v on both <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SMC_LSOC_RST_L</SIGNAL> with a charger plugged in. When I plug a battery in (charger as well) and also press the power button, I continue to get a steady 3.4v with no change weather i'm pressing the power button or not. Other readings in the same area are 3.4v on VIN and V+, 3.2v on the Reset line, and a diode mode reading of .3 on pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R5100</RESISTOR> but .47 on pin 2. This is a circuit I am not really familiar with so any tips as to what to look for would be greatly appreciated!"
