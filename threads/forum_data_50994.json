        "message":"I got my first BGA rework station. It is a older machine. OKi \/ Metcal APR-5000. They still sell nozzles and parts for the machine. It did not come with any accessories or nozzles so I need to purchase some to get started. I also need to purchase thermal-couple probes.\n\nThe GPU package is 25mm x 25mm. I was wondering what size nozzle I get for that. Do you get a nozzle slightly larger or does it really matter?\n\nI am also interested in a recommended profile for 2011 macbook boards GPU rework."
