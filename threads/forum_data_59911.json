        "PPVCORE_S0_AXG": "What is PPVCORE_S0_AXG? This is vcore going to the CPU’s integrated graphics processor for CPUs that have an integrated GPU. When this is missing on a device that has an integrated GPU and no discrete GPU, it usually means either no screen is detected, or the GPU integrated into the CPU is dead..",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",
