However thge board looked intact and not to dicked about with.\n\nAt first, there was no chime. But ALL the power rails.\n\nI reflashed the bios, still no chime.\n\nI then replaced the SMC, Now i get a chime. usb mouse illuminates, and I can PRAM reset. Still no image on external or internal screens.\n\nI have 0.9V on GPUvcore, and all other power rails are within spec.\n\nIm not sure what else to try.\n\nAny hints, i know this one is going to suck."

So correct SMC from used and we have image.\n\nGive away was it would only chime on power adapter, no chime when powered via battery. This prompted another go for SMC change."
