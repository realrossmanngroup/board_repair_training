I have to use a external mouse.   I thought the track pad probably got wet so I pulled the glued in battery and the track pad only to find out it was not the track pad.\n\nI put this one back together before I smashed something and have moved on with my work load but I have a question.\n\nIs the \"click\" a discrete line I can check resistance on or part of a data package that goes to U5701?"

I was able to feel confident enough to tear out the battery and track pad all over again to replace it once more.   I must of had a bad trackpad.  These models are crazy hard to change trackpads and I got to do it twice.   \n\nUnit came in for now power so this was a nice bonus after I fixed the LB"
