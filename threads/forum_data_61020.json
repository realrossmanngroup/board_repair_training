        "A1990": "What is A1990? A1990 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2018, 2019 with EMC3215, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01041, 820-01814..",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
