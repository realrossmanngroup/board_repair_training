I started repairing macbooks (actually Louis videos triggered me ;-) ) from a hobby perspective now and then but it has grown since to 1 or 2 a week. My repair side carrier made it possible to invest in proper tooling (trinocular microscoop, JBC soldering, Quick hotair, HP multimeter, power supply with dual 30v5A, i5 hackintosh workstation from Aliexpress :-D\n\n\nI'm working on a case (read rabbit-hole) for data recovery of an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, i'll try to be as elaborate as possible (most from memory)\n\nwhen I received the board it was doing absolutely nothing. I took some pictures of the corrosion and ultrasonically cleaned the board. this revealed some problem areas.\na lot of <SIGNAL>PP3V3_GH</SIGNAL> circuit was broken/gone, replaced some resistors and removed some caps. It works now (doesn't look very nice since i only had 0603 resistors laying around)\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59347[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]59348[/ATTACH]\nthe gone pads are TPAD testpoints/via's, didn't bother fixing those yet\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_GH</SIGNAL>, repaired the circuit and now 3,4v present (when powered via F7000)\nstill no power via USB-C (stays at 5v 0mA, other port 5v 50mA and getting hot)\nfirst replaced one <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> (the one getting hot) , still not equal mA, replaced second <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>, now both equal. <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_3GH</SIGNAL> present at <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> (usb 5v 10mA)\nI did not trust the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> (ISL) (weird impedance at <SIGNAL>AUX_DET</SIGNAL>) so replaced it\nnow Aux det is 1,2v and <RESISTOR>R7015</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7016</RESISTOR> measure ok.\nnow I get 5v at charger and 40mA cycling at both USB ports, but ISL still creates no PPBUS (12v3)\n\nwhen I supply power to the battery terminal, (7v5) it takes 15mA and I measure this voltage also at F7000 (tried 10v, no change), PPBUS is than equal to the supplied voltage\n\n<SIGNAL>SMS_RESET_R_L</SIGNAL> = 3,4v at <RESISTOR>R7072</RESISTOR>\n<SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_GH</SIGNAL> = 5v at <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR>\n<SIGNAL>SMC_AUX_OK</SIGNAL> = 3,4v at <RESISTOR>R7071</RESISTOR>\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_3GH_UPC</SIGNAL> = 3v3 at <CAPACITOR>C3100</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C3200</CAPACITOR>\n\nAny clues where to look further?"
