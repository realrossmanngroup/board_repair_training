It chimes when you reset the PRAM but after it boot it has no audio and the sound icon is greyed out.  In the system preferences it reports there are no output devices.  Does not output to the headphones when plugged into the I/O board either.  Also verified that booting from a known good external drive loaded with El Capitan has the same NO AUDIO issues. Pointers on where to start looking on the board for issues ?"
