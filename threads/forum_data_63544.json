It displays the Apple logo but then goes into super-sluggish mode, with the cursor responding in a delayed and extremely slow fashion. Fan is blowing high. It stalls during startup and I can't even launch Internet Recovery.\n\nNo obvious liquid damage. I successfully performed a DFU Restore but it still stalls indefinitely during startup. I have also tried a known-good battery and an SMC reset. Any ideas as for what else to check on this board?"
