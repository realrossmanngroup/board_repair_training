This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. ."

It's specified as 10uH / 1.4amp / 0.4ohm part number - PIYA25201B-SM.  I cannot find the exact device, usual searches turn up nothing for a PIYA 2520 1B.  Additionally i cannot find anything as small as this device .. The remains of a burnt one are on my desk and it looks like a solid state inductor.\n\nSo\n\nCan anyone recommend a source of these or equivalent part?\n\nWhat are the general requirements of an inductor sitting inline on the PP3V3 power rail"
