        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

            "message": "Hi Guys, I have a liquid damaged board in front of me. The damage seems very local. Attached pic 1 showing the affected IC (after ultrasonic!). We have replaced them. The board has an orange light fan is spinning happily. I did some test on the replaced IC, <CAPACITOR>C3990</CAPACITOR> has 3.3v now. Then on the replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> I have 12.55v on pin 4 and 12.22v on pin 3. I testedall small r as in the attached pic 2 and the lines they seem fine. I wanted to test <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> but cannot find where it is coming from in the schematics and also wander what its voltage should be. Any suggestions?\n\nRight now the system is running but no chime, I guess cause the backlight enable signla doesnt come through."
