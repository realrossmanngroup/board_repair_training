The damage seems very local. Attached pic 1 showing the affected IC (after ultrasonic!). We have replaced them. The board has an orange light fan is spinning happily. I did some test on the replaced IC, C3990 has 3.3v now. Then on the replaced Q9706 I have 12.55v on pin 4 and 12.22v on pin 3. I testedall small r as in the attached pic 2 and the lines they seem fine. I wanted to test LCD_BKLT_EN but cannot find where it is coming from in the schematics and also wander what its voltage should be. Any suggestions?\n\nRight now the system is running but no chime, I guess cause the backlight enable signla doesnt come through."}
