        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "U5810": "What is U5810? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BIL_BUTTON": "What is SMC_BIL_BUTTON? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7121": "What is R7121? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

            "message": "This board had liquid damage, I saw red points and destroyed test points near one side of SMC, it looks like liquid spread out on all the board both sides but no heavy corrosion.\nThe board was spinning only once for 4-5 seconds and just stop. There was no usual RTC cycling (on/off, on/off and on).\n\nAll rails  <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: 8,6V and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>: 3,42V with orange/green light including PWROK 3.4V on pin 3 of <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>, VCORE 1.75V, 32Mhz, PPVRTC were present during the laps where fan spins. When fan stops there was no more <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>  and got only S5 and SUS rails.\n\nWhat I did:\nI replaced <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR> (120ohms instead of 10ohms), this changed nothing.\nI checked near smc and repaired traces going to SMC from <RESISTOR>R5178</RESISTOR> TDO and <RESISTOR>R5182</RESISTOR> <SIGNAL>SMC_BIL_BUTTON</SIGNAL> (physically not used in this board).  This changed nothing.\nI checked for <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>, it was present 3.4V but when I touch the test point with my probe in voltage mode it made the fan spin again and stop, I noticed also the magsafe light switching to green and coming back to orange. I replaced just in case <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> but this also changed nothing.\nAt this point I decided to give SMC a slight reflow and the board now boots ok\n\nNow the issue:\nFan goes progressively high but it’s not trackpad TS0P related issue. I ran EFI and found the following errors:\n\n1)      Display Port (test 2 verifes no more than one error in 30s) -> Error – Lane count is zero \nI will confirm tomorrow with internal lcd and run again EFI. I used only external monitor can this only be the cause?\n\n2)      VP0R ->  Error – Sensor is reading below the low limit Error\nThis error appears only with battery plugged, I will confirm tomorrow and let it charge or just try another one. Hardware profile shows -6.5V\nAnd I am using genuine but 85W charger, is that the reason? I would expect a higher value with this charger.\n\n3)      TM0P MLB Top ->  Error – Sensor is reading below the low limit \nHardware profile shows -124Celsius must be a short or an open condition?? It says Memory proximity sensor. In schematic there is no reference to an MLB top sensor except for <TRANSISTOR>Q5850</TRANSISTOR>  marked “Placement note: TBD” (To be determined or what??).\nMy only guess is <TRANSISTOR>Q5850</TRANSISTOR>, because it’s on the TOP and near ram memory as reported by EFI.\n<CHIP>U5810</CHIP> looks a little shitty no way to tell if someone tried tor repair or only crap from liquid damage I will replace it anyways.\n\nAny thoughts about these errors?\n\nThanks"

            "message": "Indeed after charging battery VP0R error didn't show up anymore.\n\nYes it was display error Test 2. I was using external lcd because earlier, board was very far from life. I finally tried an lcd and discovered I had no backlight, image present. A5 ball was semi exploded with crap, the pad was ok! I replaced lcd driver and backlight is back. Now, there is no EFI display error with internal lcd attached, there is display error when it's not attached, I don't recall with macbook airs if it's normal to have this error with no lcd attached? I will try with another board but at this point I am not concerned anymore about this.\n\nTM0P was caused by shorted <CAPACITOR>C5813</CAPACITOR>, it was shorting out emitter and collector of <TRANSISTOR>Q5850</TRANSISTOR> (also on top MLB, near ram chips).\n\nThanks this one can be marked solved."
