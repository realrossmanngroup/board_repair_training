It had a short on PPBUS. after injecting power (removed all FDMF chips) I found a short on U8000, replaced it and now I have 13.07 on both sides of F7000. On L7030 I get fluctuation from 8.4-8.6v but there is no short. On charger I get 20V, 0.04A. Not sure what to check next. Could it be CPU already died from short before?"}

How would you suggest to find a short on PPBUS otherwise if board is completely clean? Is there anyway we can measure resistance to see if the CPU is dead?"}
