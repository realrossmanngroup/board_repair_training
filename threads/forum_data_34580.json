Minor water damage here and there, nothing crucial as it was working but not recognizing SSD. I ultrasoniced the board and the SSD and it works! Only issue, the battery is recognized but not charging. The battery itself is quite new, 11 load cycles so should not be the problem. History of the board is: was bought new 12 months ago, had a coffee spill after some weeks and has been in a drawer ever since.\n\n\nMeasured ISL resistance 17/18 26.80Ohm and 27/27 20.4Ohm.\n\n\nData lines on battery connector, diode mode\n\n\n<SIGNAL>SMBUS_CHGR_SCL</SIGNAL>=0.500V\n\n<SIGNAL>SMBUS_CHGR_SDA</SIGNAL>=0.500V\n\n\nWhat do I measure next?"

Nothing changed... So I decided to replace the ISL. Replacement ISL orientation and joints OK, as I put the board in the case and connected the battery, I heard a zap, there was a shortcut of some sort, even a hint of a smell of something burnt. \n\nSo now I'm back at square one, having no light in the charger...
