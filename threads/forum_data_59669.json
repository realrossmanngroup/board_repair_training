After further inspection of the Logic Board under the microscope I noticed U3015 to have a dark spot, it looked burnt. I went ahead and desoldered U3015, I also desoldered U3020. When I test each pad under those chips there is a short on two separate lines. \n\nFirst short under U3015, PP1V05_TBTLC, Probe:1072. \nSecond short under U3020, PP1V05-S0, Probe:600. \n\nWhen I inject 1V onto PP1V05_TBTLC, Probe:1072, U2800 heats up in the corner of the chip. \nWhen I inject 1V onto PP1V05-S0, Probe:600, U1100 heats up. \n\nOverall the machine works fine if you're not using an external monitor at all. I have already replaced this Logic Board for the customer and now I have this one sitting around, just trying to get it to work 100% again. \n\nI plan to desolder U2800 and U1100 to see if the shorts go away, if they do go away I will replace the chips with working ones and will also solder on working U3020 & U3015. I can source a U1100\/SR176 however I am having a hard time sourcing U2800\/CACTUSRIDGE4C to attempt\/complete this repair. Can anyone help me with sourcing a U2800? Also, am I on the right track?"}
