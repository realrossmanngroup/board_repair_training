            "message": "This <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3478</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> Logic Board I have will not display to an external monitor. After further inspection of the Logic Board under the microscope I noticed <CHIP>U3015</CHIP> to have a dark spot, it looked burnt. I went ahead and desoldered <CHIP>U3015</CHIP>, I also desoldered <CHIP>U3020</CHIP>. When I test each pad under those chips there is a short on two separate lines. \n\nFirst short under <CHIP>U3015</CHIP>, <SIGNAL>PP1V05_TBTLC</SIGNAL>, Probe:1072. \nSecond short under <CHIP>U3020</CHIP>, PP1V05-S0, Probe:600. \n\nWhen I inject 1V onto <SIGNAL>PP1V05_TBTLC</SIGNAL>, Probe:1072, <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> heats up in the corner of the chip. \nWhen I inject 1V onto PP1V05-S0, Probe:600, <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> heats up. \n\nOverall the machine works fine if you're not using an external monitor at all. I have already replaced this Logic Board for the customer and now I have this one sitting around, just trying to get it to work 100% again. \n\nI plan to desolder <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> and <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> to see if the shorts go away, if they do go away I will replace the chips with working ones and will also solder on working <CHIP>U3020</CHIP> & <CHIP>U3015</CHIP>. I can source a <CHIP>U1100</CHIP>/SR176 however I am having a hard time sourcing <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>/CACTUSRIDGE4C to attempt/complete this repair. Can anyone help me with sourcing a <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>? Also, am I on the right track?"
