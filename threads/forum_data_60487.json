I have 3 beeps as for memory, as it is beeping I measured <SIGNAL>PP1V35_S3_MEM</SIGNAL> = 1.35v, so I just want to know if this model is known for that kind of problems, or is it worth it to reflow the memory chips? thanks!"

This can also result in damaged pads which would not be reasonably repairable.\nOf course it can be failed RAM chips even though it doesn't happen often.\nStill, a RAM reflow followed by several passes of Memtest is worth a shot…"
