I have 3 beeps as for memory, as it is beeping I measured PP1v35_s3_mem = 1.35v, so I just want to know if this model is known for that kind of problems, or is it worth it to reflow the memory chips? thanks!"}

This can also result in damaged pads which would not be reasonably repairable.\nOf course it can be failed RAM chips even though it doesn't happen often.\nStill, a RAM reflow followed by several passes of Memtest is worth a shot\u2026"}
