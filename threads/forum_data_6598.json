When switching in now, gives a good dong so you can tell it is switched on, knocking a few keys on the keyboard and it gives error sounds so it has loaded to at least the log on screen.\nAfter diagnosis and testing, the story so far from moving backwards from the lcd connecter: [COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Need to see if voltage is getting to the screen[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]It knows when the screen has been closed as it goes to sleep when you close it[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]The screen does not come back on when you open it, but it does wake up[/FONT][/COLOR] [COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Is the screen/graphics being told to switch on?[/FONT][/COLOR]\n[COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial]Is there <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SW_LCD</SIGNAL> there?
