Its very difficult to measure anything backlight related when the mainboard is in the chasis, otherwise it won't start.\nSo I cannot check the backlight enable pins for signal because its located on the other side of the board.\n\nI'm trying to check chips <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> and <CHIP>U9801</CHIP>. \n\nOr if you can point me in the right direction if I'm completely wrong about it, that would be amazing."
