            "message": "I recently got a liquid damaged board which I got to the state of turning on and working. However, when I hook up two separate batteries, both are saying \"not charging\" and \"replace now\". When I look at System Diagnostics it shows current draw is 0mA.\n\nThings I checked:\npin 17/18 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> = 2.5ohm\npin 27/28 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> = 20.2ohm\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_BGATE</SIGNAL> = 12.5V\n[B]<SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CONN</SIGNAL> = 2.269v . <- Does this seem ok?[/B]\n<SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG</SIGNAL> = 12.59v\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR>\n[B]drain voltage: 2.269v . <- Why is it not 12v?[/B]\nsource voltage 12.59v\ngate voltage: 12.5v\nResistance drain to ground is infinite.\n\nCould it be that both the batteries I tried are broken or is my <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> broken?\n\nThanks,\nRohit"
