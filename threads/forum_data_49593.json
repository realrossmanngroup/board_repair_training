No liquid damage. Had a tiny green spot by R8534 but it still measures the way it should.\n\nWhen powering on the white hard drive led will blink 5 times, it will then chime but no video on internal or external. Replaced C9560 as usual on these but this time it didn't resolve the issue. Gave GPU a light re flow as well but no difference.\n\nOn C9560 with updated cap im getting 1.5V What to check next or is this just dead GPU?"}
