            "message": "Working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board with no liquid, but no functioning camera (\"no camera detected\"). I checked the voltage at pin 4, and it's present (5v steady). However, my diode reading for pin 4 is off; it's reading .400 compared to .470 on a good board. I checked L3508 and it seems fine (.000 diode, no resistance across). It doesn't look like this circuit is very long, and I can't figure out if there's anything between the connector and the PCH that I can check? Connector itself looks fine, and there's no damage or anything to the board.\n\nAll help appreciated!"

Same issue on both, \"no camera detected\", etc. In diode mode, I get:\n\npin 1: .000/gnd\npin 2: .470\npin 3: .470\npin 4: .400 (.470 on a good board)\npin 5: .589\npin 6: .589\n\nDiode mode readings match a known-good board on all pins except pin 4, which is lower than it should be I believe."
