I removed CB300 and the short was gone. Replaced CB300 and now diode mode was around .360 on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> and it turned on. I originally tested it without the battery and it booted to the OS, and everything was working fine. Then I connected the battery and all of a sudden, it does not boot to the OS anymore, and instead I get a flashing folder on the screen. I compared voltages on the connections on J9600 with and without the battery, and the only difference is the CLKREQ signal is low when the battery is connected, but high when its not connected. The rest of the board looks cleans, so not sure what could case this. I tried 3 different batteries and got the same problem with all of them, so its definitely a board issue.\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]Without Battery[/B][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]5.14v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4_P2V7NAND_LB</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]5.13v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_BOOT_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]1.762v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_BOOT_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]1.733v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_PWR_EN_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]0v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_PWR_EN_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]0v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>STORAGE_EN</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.327v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>STORAGE_LB_EN</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.329v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_RESET_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.3v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_RESET_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.28v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_CLKREQ_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.32v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_PCIE_CLKREQ_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.3v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_SR_EN_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.292v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>LPSR_EN_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.25v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.358v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_SSD_LB</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.3v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]With Battery[/B][/TD]\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]5.14v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4_P2V7NAND_LB</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]5.13v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_BOOT_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]1.762v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_BOOT_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]1.77v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_PWR_EN_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]0v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_PWR_EN_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]0v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>STORAGE_EN</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.327v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>STORAGE_LB_EN</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.329v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_RESET_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.3v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_RESET_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.3v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_CLKREQ_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]95mv[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_PCIE_CLKREQ_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]95mv[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>SSD_SR_EN_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.292v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>LPSR_EN_LB_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.29v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.3v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_SSD_LB</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD][RIGHT]3.3v[/RIGHT][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]"

            "message": "I got some free time to look into this again and decided to remove <CHIP>U8600</CHIP> from the board. There is continuity between the pads for <SIGNAL>S3X_PFN</SIGNAL>, so the trace was not broken. I think <CHIP>U8600</CHIP> had some broken solder balls under it though, so some signals were probably not connected. I reballed <CHIP>U8600</CHIP> and re soldered it to the board and that trace shows a good diode mode value now. Replaced <CHIP>U9300</CHIP> again, but still had no SSD voltages. That's when I found <SIGNAL>PICCOLO_IUVD</SIGNAL> is 0v instead of 1.8v. <RESISTOR>R9350</RESISTOR> was getting 13v from PPBUS but was not creating the 1.8v for some reason. The resistors seemed to measure correctly, but I replaced <RESISTOR>R9350</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R9351</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C9362</CAPACITOR> anyway, and now the SSD is working well!"
