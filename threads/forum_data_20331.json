        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "D6990": "What is D6990? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input, can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",

        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",

I have been messing around with this board for a while now, all resistors seem to be reading as per the schematic, and when I get the solid green light I get all the appropriate readings on the various components  but I am not fast enough to follow down the line before the light dims. There seems to be no signs of liquid whatsoever, this is my personal computer that out of the blue decided to not turn on any longer. Any ideas highly appreciated!"

And I just noticed today that there is a buzzing sound coming from the board when its plugged in, it is slightly high pitched. No part of the board is getting hot to the touch. I see that <RESISTOR>R8798</RESISTOR> is related to <SIGNAL>SMC_GFX_OVERTEMP_R_L</SIGNAL> and that is making me think there is a problem with the SMC, possibly GPU?

My power supply is regulated and I am unsure if this has anything to do but it would not go over 1.4V, I will figure this one out later. When I had that voltage, I did feel L7630 get hotter than other components, removed it and short was still there and since 1.4V I feel is still too low then I am still somewhat where I was. There is however, this buzzing sound being emitted louder from the cougar point <CHIP>U1800</CHIP>. The only thing I can think is that somehow my AC is not being regulated efficiently into DC and since the inductors are the ones that carry out this task, I am thinking on focusing on these harder.

Its unlikely L7630 is heating up.\n\nBuzzing sound from the PCH doesn't sound good. You sure its coming from there.\n\nKeep trying............[/QUOTE]\n\nI will figure out the deal with my power supply then inject up to 3V and go from there. The buzzing is stronger on the <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> area but not sure if its coming from there..... i will keep trying, thanx for your help so far!"

It was a good learning project and will definitely not make the same mistakes, thats for sure. Thank you"
