I have been messing around with this board for a while now, all resistors seem to be reading as per the schematic, and when I get the solid green light I get all the appropriate readings on the various components  but I am not fast enough to follow down the line before the light dims. There seems to be no signs of liquid whatsoever, this is my personal computer that out of the blue decided to not turn on any longer. Any ideas highly appreciated!"}

The buzzing is stronger on the U1800 area but not sure if its coming from there..... i will keep trying, thanx for your help so far!"}

This board is total toast. If it wasn't already you have now shorted 12V to the ACOK line at Q5310. This will have taken out the SMC and everything on that line including the ISL6259. You cannot  make mistakes like this, this board is pretty much beyond hope now for sure."}

It was a good learning project and will definitely not make the same mistakes, thats for sure. Thank you"}
