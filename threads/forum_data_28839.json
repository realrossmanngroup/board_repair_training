        "message":"Hi there,\n\nI have an 820-2936 and I'm trying to diagnose an issue with the headphone socket. When I got this board, the computer wouldn't switch to the headphones when I plugged them in. After inspecting the board I noticed there were a few components that had been knocked off around the headphone socket: R6881, R6882 and C6885.\n\nI replaced them, but the issue remained. I have found that if I have the headphones plugged in when I start the computer, they work fine, then if I unplug them while the computer is still on, it automatically switches back to the speakers, but if I plug the headphones back in again, the computer doesn't recognise them.\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBruce"

The voltages on Q6800 and Q6801 are as follows:\n\nNo headphones:\nQ6800 pin 2: 3.2V\nQ6800 pin 5: 0V\nQ6801 pin 5: 0V\n\nWith headphones:\nQ6800 pin 2: 0V\nQ6800 pin 5: 3.2V\nQ6801 pin 5: 3.2V\n\nI think this part's working the way it should, yes?\n\nThanks again."

I think that while I was testing with the board in the case, it was creating some intermittent contact issues, resulting in the problems I was having. While I was testing with the board out, everything worked fine (hence all the positive results). \n\nOce again Duke, thanks so much for your time. You can mark this one as \"solved\".\n\nBruce"
