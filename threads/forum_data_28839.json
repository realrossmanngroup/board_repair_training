When I got this board, the computer wouldn't switch to the headphones when I plugged them in. After inspecting the board I noticed there were a few components that had been knocked off around the headphone socket: <RESISTOR>R6881</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R6882</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C6885</CAPACITOR>.\n\nI replaced them, but the issue remained. I have found that if I have the headphones plugged in when I start the computer, they work fine, then if I unplug them while the computer is still on, it automatically switches back to the speakers, but if I plug the headphones back in again, the computer doesn't recognise them.\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance,\nBruce"

I think that while I was testing with the board in the case, it was creating some intermittent contact issues, resulting in the problems I was having. While I was testing with the board out, everything worked fine (hence all the positive results). \n\nOce again Duke, thanks so much for your time. You can mark this one as \"solved\".\n\nBruce"
