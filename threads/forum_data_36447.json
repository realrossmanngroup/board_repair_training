        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",

I have seen the screen brightness going up and down like someone is playing with the brightness, it's not flickering though. Moves up and down smoothly then the board cuts out.\n\nSometimes the green light goes on and off while it's just sitting on the desk.\n\nUsually what happens though is that it turn on and off (like it's doing an RTC reset) and then eventually just stays off.\n\nAll power rails seem to be present 9it's tricky to measure when it's playing up). <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL> & <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET</SIGNAL> are steady.\n\nAny suggestions?"
