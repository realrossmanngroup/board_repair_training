Tried without the trackpad connected, same issue. It will sit on the boot options screen forever without freezing or rebooting but if I select the internal drive's OS or an external drive with an OS it will show the Apple logo then after a few moments the power drops down to 0.00 amps and it reboots and chimes again. Trying to go into recovery does the same. Any ideas where to start on this issue?"}
