            "message": "Looks like you have a short in the board from <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> to GND. Sometimes you can dig it out at the LCD connector but many times you will have to lift every component on that line and run a wire to make your own rail. \nDon't dig too much around the LCD connector or risk messing up other traces. Do you at least have an image without backlight?"

            "message": "Thanks duke. Yeah i do get image, just no backlight.\n\nShit, this is going to be a pain in the bumhole..\nI did indeed do some digging at the <CAPACITOR>C9020</CAPACITOR>/<CAPACITOR>C9796</CAPACITOR> area, but I can't seem to remove the short; it's only becoming more gross-looking. (L9080 is standing on the edge of a giant crater the size of fucking grandcanyon)\n\nSo i would have to run wires from and to every component on the <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> line, without them touching any parts of that original trace, right? Doesn't that mean i have to start at pin 5 from <CHIP>U9701</CHIP>? I can't use the probe point there, so i was thinking to attach a wire to the IC itself and have that run to the caps at the LCD Connector (which, in turn need to be off the board) ?\nI guess i could mount the caps standing up?"
