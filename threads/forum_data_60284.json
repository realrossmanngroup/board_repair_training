        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. ."
