        "820-2879": "What is 820-2879? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_SLP4_L": "What is PM_SLP4_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",

            "message": "Not really busy, so I decided to check this old board witch was sitting there since 2 years.\n\nInitial issue (2 years ago): Kernel panic crash and restart so the board have been tossed away.\n\nNow (2 years later) I plug in the magsafe, the fan spins, each time after exactly 10 seconds it stops briefly and restart. When the fan restarts spinning it doesn't cycle anymore it stays  on all the way (is it now crashing before even booting?)\n\nGreen light ok pp3v42 = 3.42V stable\nResistance to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>: 93K\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.57V stable\nCharger and battery Sensing resistor measure good between <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> pin 17-18 (3ohms) and 27-28 (20ohms)\nS5 rails stable.\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> goes to 0V briefly after 10seconds (at the same time when the fan cycle) so all S3 S4 S0 rails and <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> cycle also once after 10sec and they come back.\n\nI have <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_MCP</SIGNAL>  0.9V and it goes to 0v when it hangs and come back to 0.9V when it restart. Same thing with <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>.\nRed light on USB mouse appear only four times: when I press power on button, when fan starts, again when fan stops 1 sec and finally when fans restarts.\nNo missing ram beep when ram stick removed.\n\nNo idea what else I can check, thanks."
