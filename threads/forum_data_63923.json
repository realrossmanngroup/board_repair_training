Seller give me an apple report saying: \"Liquid spill on trackpad flat, BMU battery flat and logic board. Macbook starts only when connected to DC IN and show intermittent shoutdown\".\n\nNow ,that I got, it is does not start at all, usb Amp mether shows 5V 0A on both usb-c. Connecting to the transformer adapter side (not logic board side) I can detect 5.237V and 0.034A.\n\nTearing down the logic board I can confirm there was liquid spill on the battery connector area and the battery flat. Liquid spill also on the trackpad connector and small amount on the antenna wifi connectors.\n\nThe back side of the board is pretty clean, no sings of corrosion or cleaning.\n\nThe fact is that this moderboard was already cleaned from moisture.\n\nno components it's getting hot when plugged in.\n\nUpon cheking, no low resistance found at each inductor / coil on the board.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL>\n1 <SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL>            12.3V\n2 <SIGNAL>PPVIN_LCDBKLT_F</SIGNAL>   12.3V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL>\nL5800\n1 <SIGNAL>P3V8AON_VSW1</SIGNAL> 3.78V\n2 <SIGNAL>PP3V8AON_PH1</SIGNAL>  3.78V\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_AON_CHGR_R</SIGNAL> 5V on both ports\n\nLDO outputs\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC1_LDO</SIGNAL> 3.44V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_UPC1_LDO_CORE</SIGNAL> 1.58V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC0_LDO</SIGNAL> 3.44V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_UPC0_LDO_CORE</SIGNAL> 1.58V\n\n<CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> support voltages\n\nCC270\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S2</SIGNAL> 0V\n\nRG2A0\n1 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_LDO</SIGNAL>   0V\n2 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_UF790</SIGNAL>   0.34V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_USBLS1_ISNS</SIGNAL> 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_WLBT_ISNS</SIGNAL> 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V25_S2</SIGNAL> 0V\n\nRC714\n<SIGNAL>P3V3S2_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> 0V\n<SIGNAL>P3V3S2_EN</SIGNAL> 0V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON_3V3S2_VIN_ISNS</SIGNAL> 12.30V\n\nLC260\n1 <SIGNAL>P5VS2TPS_PHASE</SIGNAL> 0V\n2 <SIGNAL>PP5V_S2</SIGNAL> 0V\n\n\n<SIGNAL>P5VS2_PWR_EN_RC</SIGNAL> 0V\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_LDOINT_MPMU</SIGNAL>  1.48V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP17V0_LDOIN</SIGNAL>   3.30V.\n\n\nresistance to ground of [B]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2</SIGNAL>[/B].\nCC717\npin1 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2</SIGNAL> 35 ( 2000K scale on multimeter) ohms\npin0 gnd         0 ohms\n\nUpon cheking, no low resistance found at each inductor / coil on the board.
