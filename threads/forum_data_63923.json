Seller give me an apple report saying: \"Liquid spill on trackpad flat, BMU battery flat and logic board. Macbook starts only when connected to DC IN and show intermittent shoutdown\".\n\nNow ,that I got, it is does not start at all, usb Amp mether shows 5V 0A on both usb-c. Connecting to the transformer adapter side (not logic board side) I can detect 5.237V and 0.034A.\n\nTearing down the logic board I can confirm there was liquid spill on the battery connector area and the battery flat. Liquid spill also on the trackpad connector and small amount on the antenna wifi connectors.\n\nThe back side of the board is pretty clean, no sings of corrosion or cleaning.\n\nThe fact is that this moderboard was already cleaned from moisture.\n\nno components it's getting hot when plugged in.\n\nUpon cheking, no low resistance found at each inductor \/ coil on the board.\n\nPPBUS_AON\n1 PPBUS_AON            12.3V\n2 PPVIN_LCDBKLT_F   12.3V\n\nPP3v8_AON\nL5800\n1 P3V8AON_VSW1 3.78V\n2 PP3V8AON_PH1  3.78V\n\n\nPPDCIN_AON_CHGR_R 5V on both ports\n\nLDO outputs\n\nPP3V3_UPC1_LDO 3.44V\nPP1V5_UPC1_LDO_CORE 1.58V\n\nPP3V3_UPC0_LDO 3.44V\nPP1V5_UPC0_LDO_CORE 1.58V\n\nCD3217 support voltages\n\nCC270\nPP5V_S2 0V\n\nRG2A0\n1 PP3V3_S2_LDO   0V\n2 PP3V3_UF790   0.34V\n\nPP3V3_S2_USBLS1_ISNS 0V\nPP3V3_S2_WLBT_ISNS 0V\nPP1V25_S2 0V\n\nRC714\nP3V3S2_PWR_EN 0V\nP3V3S2_EN 0V\n\nPPBUS_AON_3V3S2_VIN_ISNS 12.30V\n\nLC260\n1 P5VS2TPS_PHASE 0V\n2 PP5V_S2 0V\n\n\nP5VS2_PWR_EN_RC 0V\n\n\nPP1V5_LDOINT_MPMU  1.48V\n\nPP17V0_LDOIN   3.30V.\n\n\nresistance to ground of [B]PP3v3_S2[\/B].\nCC717\npin1 PP3v3_S2 35 ( 2000K scale on multimeter) ohms\npin0 gnd         0 ohms\n\nUpon cheking, no low resistance found at each inductor \/ coil on the board.
