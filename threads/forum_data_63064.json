There is USB activity, chime is there, fans spin up when battery is disconnected as if it's booting. backlight is there. Tested with known good screen, nothing but backlight.\n\nAlso it doesn't seem to turn off backlight if I close the lid. So perhaps has to do with SMC lid?"}

I see that come components there communicate directly with SMC, do you think SMC can cause no image? there was corrosion on the SMC_onoff_L test point near the SMC"}
