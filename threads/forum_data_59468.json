Opened, of course water damage. Replaced water damaged area ( U770, R7731,R7715), started to work.\nNoticed that there are some water marks around SMC, cleaned, reflowed. Also corrosion around U7100, cleaned it up, trace disappeared from c7121to C7120, ran a wire, made sure there is no short. Connected my charger from DC power supply, was taking 2,4amps, fan spins, backlight on all good, customer collected.\n\nAfter week customer calls back in, saying it is not charging, i try my power supply, it is charging, try customers charger, it is not, so all blame on charger.\nAfter a week customer comes in with new charger, still not charging, but charging fine from my DC power supply.\nI tested customers charger on another a1466 and it is working fine.\nSo i decided to check around U7100, all voltages are present. So decided to swap U7100, and there problems begun. I replaced U7100, got 4v on PPBUS_g3h, decided that either soldering is not good or ic is faulty, so replaced one more, this time inspecting closely all pins under microscope, soldering was decent, still same 4v. replaced once more with 3rd ic, same 4v on PPBUS_g3h.\n\nNow PPBUS_G3H is at 4V, Here are the measurements:\n\nGreen light\/Orange light Present\n\nPP3v42_g3h = 3.42V\n\nU7100\nPin1 0v\nPin2 14v\nPin3 3.8v\nPin4 2.53v\nPin5 2.35v\nPin6 0v\nPin7 2.68v\nPin8 0.58v\nPin9 0.01v\nPin10 3.36v\nPin11 3.32v\nPin12 3.38v\nPin13 3.08v\nPin14 3.08v\nPin15 0.04v\nPin16 3.8v\nPin17 3.9v\nPin18 3.9v\nPin19 5.05v\nPin20 5.03v\nPin21 0.02v\nPin22 0v\nPin23 3.93v\nPin24 4.86v\nPin25 4.74v\nPin26 12.68v\nPin27 14.4v\nPin28 14.46v\n\nResistance between pins 17\/18 = 3.2ohm\nResistance between pins 27\/28 = 20.3ohm\n\nAll resistors around u7100 looks good and i also measured them agains schematic, they are ok.\n\nAny help will be much appreciated. Thanks."}

Replaced Q7130, was no joy. Decided just in case to replace C7125(it was not shorted) and PPBUS_G3H returned.\nCan mark as solved."}
