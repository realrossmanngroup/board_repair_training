Tested with his 45W and it was not working I stupidely told the dude his charger is not good. He told me nope it works with another machine:)\n\nAnd indeed his charger was working with other macbook air,\n\nI often have issues with Q7180 or DC-in circuitry but never had this exact issue with Q7180 trolling depending on the type of charger you use...\nSorry John didn't replaced  ISL, I cheated, I usually replace it when I have an issue with upper or lower buck converter mosfets.\n\nThanks again it's solved"}
