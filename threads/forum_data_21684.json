    "definitions": {
        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "U2850": "What is U2850? a CHIP.",
        "U7980": "What is U7980? a CHIP.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "PP1V8_S0": "What is PP1V8_S0? PP1V8_S0 is a power rail that is present when the machine is in an S0 state, meaning it is fully turned on, not sleeping or hiberating .",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",
        "PP1V5_S3": "What is PP1V5_S3? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_S0_PGOOD": "What is PM_S0_PGOOD?  PM_S0_PGOOD is created when CPUVR_PGOOD and ALL_SYS_PWRGD are present and branches off to become PM_PCH_PWROK. PM_S0_PGOOD and SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD are necessary to create SYS_PWROK_R and PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK .",
        "CPUIMVP_PGOOD": "What is CPUIMVP_PGOOD? CPUIMVP_PGOOD is a signal from the CPU VCORE buck converter IC that indicates CPU power is good which is necessary to create PM_S0_PGOOD..",
        "R7974": "What is R7974? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7970": "What is Q7970? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
        "U2800": "What is U2800? a CHIP.",
        "SYSCLK_CLK25M_SB": "What is SYSCLK_CLK25M_SB? a SIGNAL.",
        "SYSCLK_CLK25M_ENET": "What is SYSCLK_CLK25M_ENET? a SIGNAL."
