Board looks fine. i didn't find liquid or corrosion damage on board. Even i didn't find any burnt component or loose soldering through visual inspection.\nThen check some voltages and found everything normal.\nFrom PPBUS_G3H to CPU VCORE. All 5V, 3V rails and S5 and S0 rails also.  All these are present and normal.\nSMC_Wake_L---3V\nSMC_RESET_L--3.4V\nSMC_CLK32K--1.7V\nPM_SLP_S4_L---3.3V\nSMC_ONOFF_L--3.4V\n\n\nCould you please guide me what i am leaving behind?"}
