            "message": "So today I was working on a board which was apparently \"sometimes not turning on\", had it for a week and was always powering on fine, without inspecting it - I was going to send it back to the customer tomorrow but spotted it wouldn't turn on.\n\nLong story short after inspecting the board, found liquid damage across the <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> area, three resistors were completely burnt through and believe <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> was damaged, so replaced it all and still won't power and only pulls around 0.1A.\n\nDon't have many readings at the moment because I'm not with the board now but will do tomorrow morning. I checked <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and had noticed it was on 1.9V. Injected volts and spotted <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> was blown (not surprised) as well as a cap above it so took them off and PPBUS now has ~8V. When I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> the board still wouldn't power up but had 1V coming out of the inductor after <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR>. I sprayed some isopropyl alcohol over the area to see for any shorts and after a minute or so saw a pop come from <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> itself. It had blown.\n\nI'm not sure what could be causing this as I've replaced all of <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> area, and <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> keeps blowing.\n\nReally need help with this as its a very stressful board to work on. I understand it would be difficult for anyone to help because of the lack of readings, but if anyone can point me in a direction for what readings are needed, I'll get those as soon as I can!\n\nThank you"

I do remember that the CPU area was getting fairly warm even with ppbus being on 1.9V, guessing that's because of the <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> short.\n\nWhen I injected volts into ppbus, I did that after replacing both <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> and its resistors, as well as replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> with a known working one so I'm guessing something else might have caused <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> to pop"

It powers up so PCH isn't dead thankfully.\n\nBad news is it seems to only like booting up when I spray isopropyl alcohol on top of the <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>. So will be investigating that further. \nWhen there is no alcohol over that area, the board pulls 0.05A, and L7630 only has 0.2V, then with alcohol over <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> its a full 1V.\n\nNot sure if you may know the possible cause and if readings are required I'll be able to get those now. Sorry for the lack of readings - Never really attempted in-depth board repairs like this, only a case of if I see liquid, replace those parts and not bother with readings (now I'll start keeping a Datasheet of all diode, resistance and volt readings for parts)"

Practice makes perfect I guess.\n\nThanks for your help so far and will update once this area has been worked on - So glad the PCH isn't dead though"
