There was a little sticky substance and corrosion on <CAPACITOR>C7670</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7665</CAPACITOR>. Board will take anywhere between 25 and 100 milliamps and then it will cycle, but the cycles are not consistent.  <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.29 V with battery plugged in and without battery. Have tried restoring with Apple Configurator 2, but I get stuck with Error 4005. <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> is missing, where the corrosion occurred. Pin 12 which is the enable pin of <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> appears to come from <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> and is also missing. Not sure where to go from here."
