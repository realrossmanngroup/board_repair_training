The board looks in very good condition, as it should be. The board turned on just fine pulling the 20v without the battery plugged in to J6951. The moment I plug the battery in to this connector, the USB-C meter turns on briefly, but reboots. I am not seeing any damage to the battery cable. Not really sure where to go from here. The battery appears to be in great condition too. What should I be looking at? What could cause this? The moment I unplug the battery, it pulls the 20v, again just fine, the fans spin and all too. I even saw the screen show the battery dead symbol, but of course the battery was not plugged in at this point. To add, the battery was working just fine when plugged in previously with another board. I am perplexed."}

Go figure! Thank you all so very much."}
