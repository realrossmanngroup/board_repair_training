        "message":"Hi guys,I'm having this a1278 2011 with 820-2936 logic board.\neverything is working fine, can pass ADT, but it has a problem with random shutdown.\n\nthere is no special symptoms that when or how the shut down would happen.\nit just randomly shut down while using the machine.\nit's not the heat related issue, I used temp monitor (software) to monitor the temps, almost everything is under 70C.\n\nI tried to stress the video function and see if that's the cause, but not really, still random and not seem to be related.\n\njust wondering if anyone had similar experience and know how to approach on problem like this?\n\nthanks"
