This means the SSD will not be accessible when this signal is asserted.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v..",

But if i boot up holding the option key, it then shows the ssd. Also, if i boot into recovery mode, it ssd shows up. I can boot into the ssd OS when i use the option key.\n\nFound corrosion around <CHIP>U3740</CHIP>, so replace chip, <RESISTOR>R3741</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R3742</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C3740</CAPACITOR>. Also, had to repair trace on <CAPACITOR>C3740</CAPACITOR>(1) due to missing pad. Still have ssd talking issue. \n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_SSD</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n<SIGNAL>SSD_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>SSD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> - 3.2\n<SIGNAL>SSD_CLKREQ_L</SIGNAL> - 0.0\n<SIGNAL>SSD_RESET_CONN_L</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n\nOnly measurements i found different so far was on <CAPACITOR>C3714</CAPACITOR> to 3717, pads 2 were all reading 0v while pad 1 were reading 0.52. Compared to <CAPACITOR>C3710</CAPACITOR> to 3713, pad 2 were all reading  0.3 and 0.39 on pad 1. Not sure what this means."
