        "message":"I got this air with a backlight problem. It was liquid damaged around the LVDS connector.\nReplaced the connector and the cable. Put it in the ultrasonic cleaner.\nI put everything together. I left it running and when I came back the LCD was dark.\nIt didn't react to the power button anymore.\n\nNow I have missing PP3V3_SUS.\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.58V\nPP3V3_S5 - 3.3V\nPP5V_S5 - 5V\n\nPM_BATLOW_L - 3.3V\nPM_SLP_SUS_L - 0V\n\nI checked RTC voltage and all is good. 32KHz is present.\n\nOnly liquid damage was around the connector. The board is not corroded.\nWhere else to look? I hope the PCH just not died."
