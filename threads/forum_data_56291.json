            "message": "So today I have on the healing bench and <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00430</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with no power. The first debug LED from the bottom is the \"S5\" LED. It comes on solid, then blinks a few times, goes off for a while, then blinks really fast a few times then goes out completely. So I gather it is not even in an S5 state. Here are the measurements from the S5 rails currently:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP12V_S5</SIGNAL>: 2.2V\n<SIGNAL>PP45V_S5</SIGNAL>: 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>: .7V\n\nI am getting 12.15V on the 3 pins from the power supply, as well as the \"G3Hot Rails\"\n\nHaven't worked on these really so I thought it would be educational to give it a try and see if I could solve it, with some assistance."
