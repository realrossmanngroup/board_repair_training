        "message":"Hi there!\nWas wondering if I could get some advice on replacing one of those plastic connectors.. How the hell is it done so it doesn't bridge the pins under the connector. I've tried 4 times and always have some sort of bridging. Ran out of doner boards with them on now too. Is it possible to buy just the connectors from somewhere?\nThanks!"
