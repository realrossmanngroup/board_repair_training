        "message":"Hello. Got this board that was not powering on. After inspection I found little corrosion around SMC chip. I then reballed the SMC to remove any corrosion under it and replaced C7536 as it had corrosion on it also. No other spots of corrosion found.\n\nPPBUS_G3H stable at 8.57V\nPP3V42_G3H stable on 3.44V\nSMC_RST_L stable on 3.38V\nPPVRTC_G3H a little unstable, but variating between 3.3V and 3.45V\nPP5V_S5 oscillating like roller coaster, same to PP3V3_S5\n\nTried replacing U7501 and C7505 just in case. Same thing. I compared diode mode between this board and a working one and found this board is giving lower value on L7520(this one gives 0.393 and working on gives 0.409) but I'm not sure if this is a real issue as the values are close. Any ideas on what to check? I tried already tu put flux around CPU and heat it from under side on 250 degrees for some time until flux got liquid and flowed under the chip, but same result."
