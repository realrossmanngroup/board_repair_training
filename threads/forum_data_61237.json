            "message": "Hello. Got this board that was not powering on. After inspection I found little corrosion around SMC chip. I then reballed the SMC to remove any corrosion under it and replaced <CAPACITOR>C7536</CAPACITOR> as it had corrosion on it also. No other spots of corrosion found.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> stable at 8.57V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> stable on 3.44V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RST_L</SIGNAL> stable on 3.38V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> a little unstable, but variating between 3.3V and 3.45V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> oscillating like roller coaster, same to <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>\n\nTried replacing <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C7505</CAPACITOR> just in case. Same thing. I compared diode mode between this board and a working one and found this board is giving lower value on L7520(this one gives 0.393 and working on gives 0.409) but I'm not sure if this is a real issue as the values are close. Any ideas on what to check? I tried already tu put flux around CPU and heat it from under side on 250 degrees for some time until flux got liquid and flowed under the chip, but same result."
