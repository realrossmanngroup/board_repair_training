When the computer power button is pressed the chime is heard but nothing seen on the screen.\n\nCustomer mentioned that they bought a Chinese Charger as the original charger was not available in the store.\n\nInspected the board and found that some solder balls were found near the CAPS that belong to the PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT - namely - C7766 \/ C7767 \/ C7768 \/ C7769 \/ C7770 \/ C7771 \/ C7772.\n\nThese are the power rails that I checked so far and here are my readings.\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.56v\nPPDCIN_G3H - 16.83v\nPP3V42_G3H -  3.43v\nPP5v_S5  - 5.03v\n\u200bPP5v_S3  - 0v\n\u200bPP5v_S0  - 0v\nPP3V3_S5 -  3.34v\nPP3V3_S0 - 0v\nPP3V3_S3 - 0.18V \nPP3V3_S4 - 0v\nPP1V8_S3 - 0v\nPP1V2_S3 - 0v\nPP1V5_S0 - 0V\nPP1V05_S0 -  0V\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 0V\n\nAm I missing anything.
