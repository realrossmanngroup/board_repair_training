Board doesn't chime, found some corrosion around u6100. \nHave my important power rails and have green\/orange light on charger. \nRemoved u6100, pads still ok put it back on as have nothing to change it with. \nSame readings before hand and after putting back on. \nPin 1 3.3v\nPin 2 3.3v\nPin 3 3.3v\nPin 4 Ground\nPin 5 0v\nPin 6 0v\nPin 7 3.3v\nPin 8 3.3v\n\nSo pin 5 does not have SPI_MLB_MOSI coming in and neither is pin 6 getting its SPI_MLB_CLK\n\nAlso probe point XDP_PCH_PWRBTN_L is completely corroded away. \n\nI get no readings either side of r5122, r5127, r5112, I was assuming if I traced it back the problem component would show itself so does this mean U1800 is dead because I can't get SPI_MOSI_R?\n\nCare to share some pointers for next steps?\n\nTHANKING YOU!"}

Remove U6100 and check on diode mode pins 1,2,5,6 on the board. They all should read something, if not check the resistors\/traces to U1800."}
