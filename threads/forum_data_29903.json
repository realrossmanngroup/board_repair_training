I have most of the necessary equipment:  ultrasonic cleaner, AmScope microscope, hot air station, hakko fx-951, quality fluke meter, power supply,  etc.\n\nI have a macbook air 11\" MLB <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00164</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that I am using as a training board.\nIt has no liquid contact of any kind.  \nDid not power or have any magsafe light when I received it.\nTroubleshot and repaired the one wire circuit (thanks Louis!) at and around <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> (a couple dodgy traces and bad resistor).  Magsafe adapter now lights up, but machine does not power UNLESS the flex cable from left IO board is disconnected.  Machine will boot all the way to login.\n\nFurther troubleshooting found a bad <TRANSISTOR>Q3080</TRANSISTOR> not passing <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S4SW_TBTBST_FET</SIGNAL> to pin 27 of <CHIP>U3090</CHIP>.\nThis may have been a lucky find as this circuit seem to be for Thunderbolt. \n\nNOW:  When flex cable is connected the voltage at cathode side of <DIODE>D3095</DIODE> is 0V\nWhen disconnected it is 15V\nI am still getting familiar with the process and in understanding the various power states and how to determine this.\nAny and all guidance would be greatly appreciated."
