        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP.",
        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. ."
