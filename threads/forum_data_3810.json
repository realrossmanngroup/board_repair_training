But when I look om =PPBUS_G3H or DCIN or any other rail,  I see a strange recurring pulse. See picture attached of PP18V5_DCIN_CONN power rail. it is on 820-4924, but I have had this problem on other boards to 3115,2915 ect . Sometimes it solves it self, other times not, I have measured the current sensing resistors around U7100 (U7000) and they are up to spec. It does not seem like its the power rails it self that does this. Is this some kind of SMC thing or what is this ? \nCould be nice if anyone else have had this problem to and knows how to solve it."}

The usual suspects are clock chip, U1950 (on airs), resistors in SPI lines to ROM. Could also be 100 other things why it is doing that. 4924 many times have shorted CPU cause of liquid on CPU Vcore regulator.\nFind the corrosion and you will find the problem."}
