            "message": "So the powerails are ok. But when I look om =<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> or DCIN or any other rail,  I see a strange recurring pulse. See picture attached of <SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_CONN</SIGNAL> power rail. it is on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, but I have had this problem on other boards to 3115,2915 ect . Sometimes it solves it self, other times not, I have measured the current sensing resistors around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> (<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>) and they are up to spec. It does not seem like its the power rails it self that does this. Is this some kind of SMC thing or what is this ? \nCould be nice if anyone else have had this problem to and knows how to solve it."
