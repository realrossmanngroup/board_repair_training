The volume is super low on the audio jack (internal expeakers work great) about 10% of what it should be. Also, the right channel wasnt working, after replacing the audio jack now both channels work but still super low volume. \n\nI did SMC, PRAM reset, tried another OS install, tried changing settings in MIDI (master volume is grayed out), but still same issue. What should i be looking for?"}
