    "definitions": {
        "820-00923": "What is 820-00923? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",
        "PP5V5_S5": "What is PP5V5_S5? This is a typo of PP5V_S5 When you see PP5V_S5, assume they meant to type PP5V_S5.",
        "PP5V_S0_VCORE1": "What is PP5V_S0_VCORE1? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP5V_S0_FAN_CONN": "What is PP5V_S0_FAN_CONN? a SIGNAL.",
        "PCH_INTRUDER": "What is PCH_INTRUDER? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP5V_S0_VCORE2": "What is PP5V_S0_VCORE2? a SIGNAL.",
        "PLT_RST_L": "What is PLT_RST_L? This is an abbreviation of “PLT_RESET_L” – when you see “PLT_RST_L\", assume the person meant to type PLT_RESET_L."
