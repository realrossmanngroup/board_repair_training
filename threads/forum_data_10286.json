        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U7600": "What is U7600? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on.."

I changed <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>.\nPIN 11 on the board was totally corroded so I fixed that with a jumper cable.\n\nAlso <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> looked pretty pad so I replaced that one too.\nHere PIN 8 was missing. I fixed that also with a jumper cable.\n\nAfter this, the board went into the ultrasonic cleaner.\n\nNow, looks like all the power rails come up for a second, but the fan does not spin.\n\nThe liquid damage was around the BIOS chip.\n<CHIP>U7600</CHIP> and <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>. Some was around the SMC.\nI pulled the WLED driver because it looked really bad.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken Y1905 was oscillating prior the repair. Now there is 0.9V but it does not oscillate.\n\nI also pulled the BIOS chip because PIN 8 was totally corroded.\nEven without the BIOS chip fan doesn't move.\n\nAfter this I reballed the SMC. Didn't help anything.\n\nIf I leave the board on the charger <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> gets warm. I changed it just for the hell of it.\n\nAny idea?\n\nThank you."
