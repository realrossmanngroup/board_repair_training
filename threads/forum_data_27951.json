I wonder if there is a stuffing option on the boards (ie. <SIGNAL>GMUX_CFG0</SIGNAL>) or maybe just keep the PCI bus in reset by reconfiguring a resistor so the driver can't see it."

Then check if <SIGNAL>PEX_CLKREQ_L</SIGNAL> stays high and if it forced to internal GFX. If it does not stay high you may need to pull it up to 3V with a 10K resistor. No guarantees this works though...."
