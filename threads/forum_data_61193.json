            "message": "Hello. Got this board here with loud fans and running REALLY slow. Ran HWMONITOR and various sensors are 128 celsius. They are: Ambient, CPU Proximity, PCH Die, Memory, System Proximity and Fan Inlet Right. Tried with new trackpad/cable, same issue. Replaced SMC as I suspected it was bad because of the number of sensors reading erratically, same result. Replaced <CHIP>U5870</CHIP> also just in case. Same result. Any hints?"
