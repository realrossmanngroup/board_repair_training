But why he could not fix that board eventually? was the bios file corrupted in the original? if so if i upload a bios file here how will it be fixed?"}

Saves a LOT of time and doesn't risk breaking the BIOS by desoldering it.\n\nThe site selling them is a bit questionable though, so I don't want to give free traffic by posting it publicly. Just google it or shoot me a PM if you're interested.\n\nAnyways the ME region is the firmware for a separate part of the CPU (Kinda like a processor for your processor). If this firmware data is wrong\/damaged\/not matching the CPU it will show odd behaviour. You'll have to clear the 'used' ME region and place a clean firmware on there. Use google, it should be fairly easy if you take some time to read it through"}
