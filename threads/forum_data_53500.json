        "message":"Hi, \n\nGot this mba with water damage and it wasnt booting After some repairs it start and all is working fine except of fan that is going crazy. There was water damage in SMC area. \n\nI checked and J6000 Pin3 comparing with other board has strange behavour. It starts on 0,2 V, then begin jumping up down from 0,2 to 3.3. As FAN_RT_PWM line is only going to SMC i decided that SMC Is bad or there is some shit under it so i changed it. Now after replacement it is doing exactly same. \n\n\nAHT give PFM003 error \"There may be some issue with fan\". \n\nVisually it start normal, after 3-4 seconds begin to spin slower until stop for a few seconds, than start again and going to high speed. \n\n\nAny idea?"
