Diode mode shows very low readings for all three, however, I'm thinking of replacing that capacitor. At first I thought the traces could be corroded between ISL and <CAPACITOR>C7050</CAPACITOR> due to the corrosion there, but when I jumped wires the issue got worse instead of better (dim blinking amber magsafe instead of solid green but no power), so I removed them.\n\nI've noticed my pin 8 is also showing very low, usually it's supposed to be around 2v but it's showing something much lower, I believe around ~70mv. Again, the associated capacitors and resistors to that pin are measuring correctly against a good board. I've noticed a few of my boards have low voltage on pin 8--I'm guessing a related cause?
