    "definitions": {
        "820-01598": "What is 820-01598? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U6903": "What is U6903? This chip is responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H in 2016-2018 model Macbook logic boards.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PP5V_G3S": "What is PP5V_G3S? PP5V_G3S is a 5v power rail present when the system is in a G3S standby state.",
        "PP1V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V8_SLPS2R? PP1V8_SLPS2R is a 1.8v power rail present when the system is in a SLPS2R state. .",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "P5VG3S_EN": "What is P5VG3S_EN? This signal enables the PP5V_G3S power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "PMU_PVDDMAIN_EN": "What is PMU_PVDDMAIN_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "P3V3MAIN_PGOOD": "What is P3V3MAIN_PGOOD? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V_G3H_RTC": "What is PP3V_G3H_RTC? PP3V_G3H_RTC is a 3v power rail present when the machine is in a G3H mechanical off state that powers the RTC circuit. .",
        "R6900": "What is R6900? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q8401": "What is Q8401? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "PP2V5_NAND_SSD0": "What is PP2V5_NAND_SSD0? PP2V5_NAND_SSD0 This is a power rail that powers the NAND on Macbooks where the solid state drive is soldered directly to the board. .",
        "PP0V9_SSD0": "What is PP0V9_SSD0? This is a power rail for the soldered on SSD on newer Macbooks. .",
        "PPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0": "What is PPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_G3H_SSD0": "What is PP3V3_G3H_SSD0? a SIGNAL.",
        "SSD0_VR_P2V5_EN": "What is SSD0_VR_P2V5_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "SSD_PMU_RESET_L": "What is SSD_PMU_RESET_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "SSD0_OCARINA_WP_L": "What is SSD0_OCARINA_WP_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "SSD0_OCARINA_RESET_L": "What is SSD0_OCARINA_RESET_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. ."
