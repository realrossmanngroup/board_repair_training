In Linux there is no issue with either.\nWe replaced the trackpad with no effect. \nThe computer is \"usable\" in safe mode so I was wondering if something like this software could be an ASD alternative? [URL]https://www.tunabellysoftware.com/tgpro/[/URL]\n\nI tried to run ASD 3S115 however when I attempt to boot to that drive I get an angry beep and the computer restarts.\nI believe I need ASD 3S150 based on the link below however the download for that doesn't work! Failure to extract or somesuch error. \n\n[URL]https://www.loremipsum.info/ia-tools-blog/[/URL]"

Could this be something else?\n\nThe behavior has now changed from not moving much / very slow. (Mac also runs slow) to randomly jumping around the screen. \n\nIt's up to memory tests now so I guess that rules out sensors.?"
