Got this board here with a strange issue. It partially turns on(some S0 state voltages are present). No fan spin. I have DDR voltage stable ate 1.2V, but PP5V_S4 is measuring low, at only 3.05V. Tried replacing TPS51980 and MOSFET, still same. Something is dragging 5V voltage down, some kind of leakage, but nothing gets warm. Board had no corrosion at all, everything looks pristine. Any tips on how to solve this?"}

Replaced C7524 just in case, same thing. PP5V_S5 is stable @5V. I tried lifting every cap related to 5V output that point to GND, but same 3V on PP5V_S4RS3 output but same. Certainly something has leaking voltage on 5V line, but cannot find what it is."}
