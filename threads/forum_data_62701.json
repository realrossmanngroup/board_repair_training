I have DDR voltage stable ate 1.2V, but <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> is measuring low, at only 3.05V. Tried replacing <CHIP>TPS51980</CHIP> and MOSFET, still same. Something is dragging 5V voltage down, some kind of leakage, but nothing gets warm. Board had no corrosion at all, everything looks pristine. Any tips on how to solve this?"
