Unsteady voltage - too low. Slightly lower voltage than what is necessary on framebuffer causes what? Remove the coil from the framebuffer line, attach a power supply to the framebuffer line, watch a youtube video, and slowly lower the voltage on your power supply. When it drops too low, it just dies. No apple logo with checkerboard pattern on the screen, no bootup with funny colors, just death. \n\nThe 2011 failure mode is very different from 2010."}

Then the GPU, the machine would boot but crash\/shutdown on stress tests. The heat cycles of my rework station seemed to be fixing it. I had the eureka moment as i was reading this, Change C9560 and now it runs rock solid with no random shutdowns or issues!. Thanks!"}
