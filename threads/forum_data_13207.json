        "A1286": "What is A1286? A1286 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2009 , Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2255, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2330, 820-2532, 820-2523, 820-2533, 820-2850, 820-2915, 820-3330..",
        "C9560": "What is C9560? Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

            "message": "Think about what the issue is with those caps when they die. Unsteady voltage - too low. Slightly lower voltage than what is necessary on framebuffer causes what? Remove the coil from the framebuffer line, attach a power supply to the framebuffer line, watch a youtube video, and slowly lower the voltage on your power supply. When it drops too low, it just dies. No apple logo with checkerboard pattern on the screen, no bootup with funny colors, just death. \n\nThe 2011 failure mode is very different from 2010."

            "message": "Funny this thread came up, It inspired me to replace <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> on an odd symptom 2011 i had, First i redid the gmux as it seemed to have switching issues. Then the GPU, the machine would boot but crash/shutdown on stress tests. The heat cycles of my rework station seemed to be fixing it. I had the eureka moment as i was reading this, Change <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> and now it runs rock solid with no random shutdowns or issues!. Thanks!"
