The topcase is therefore bent downwards in the middle of the keyboard.\nLuckily, it didn't seem to bend the logic board itself. I was able to unscrew it and it didn't pop out or anything like that.\nI got a new topcase, but still don't have working keyboard and trackpad.\nI have put the logic board into a good working A1708 and the same problem exists. So this is not an issue with the keyboard, trackpad, or trackpad cable.\nThe only button that works is the power button.\nPressing the caps lock key doesn't turn the green LED on.\n\nThis is my first time having this kind of issue so I'm not fully sure where to start.\nI have checked the basics, and could confirm that all power rails on the trackpad keyboard were present."}
