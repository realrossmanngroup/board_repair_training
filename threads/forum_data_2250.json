Add them all up. See how it should add up to 2.203 ohms?\n\nSee how your measurement is 115 ohms?\n\nFigure out what's broken. It's a trace, via, or resistor somewhere in that \"loop\""}

If R7005 is not good the ISL6259 will be dead too.\nCheck for shorts to GND on R7050 and 7051 before replacing them, a shorted 6259 will kill the new resistor again."}
