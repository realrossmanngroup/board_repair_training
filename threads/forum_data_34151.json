All voltages look good but no 12v to 40v boost.  \nI DO get a backlight and video output with a donor 13\" A1502 screen attached.  Obviously all voltages are OK and I'm getting the 40v boost.\nWith patient 15\" screen attached to the 13\" A1502 I pulled the donor screen from, I get backlight and video output.  I am hoping for suggestions on where to go from here."}
