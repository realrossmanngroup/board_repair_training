Now I gotta tackle the issue of not seeing the keyboard or trackpad. Any Ideas on that? BTW a little history on this machine. No reports of liquid damage though I am sure it has been dropped once or more, the back corner of the machine is ever so slightly bent. board looks really clean though I have not removed it."
