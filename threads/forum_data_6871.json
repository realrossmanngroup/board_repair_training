I know this machine isn't worth anything but this is more a learn exercise for me.\nIt appears to me that I either have a bad gpu or bad vram. Not sure what the diagnostic steps are with this issue. I do have Jovy rework station and do have some experience with BGA rework/reballing. Please let me know what you think. Thanks.  [ATTACH]6872._xfImport[/ATTACH]"
