        "message":"Hi, I have an issue where sometimes I plug the board in, I get only 5.02v and 0.32a and other times when I move the power cord from one port to the other it will go to 20.02 v and bounce from 0.00a - 0.07a. it will do this until I pull the plug. When it shows 5.02v and 0.32a it will jump to 5.15v in a few seconds, then power cycles. Under a thermal cam, when I get the 5.02v - 5.16v I can see the CD3217 get hot, but also the U6903 power IC pulsates, hot to cold. When it shows me 20.02v only U6903 pulsates, but the CD3217 doesn't get hot. I did originally believe it was the CD3217 that was getting hot, so I replaced it with a brand new one, but nothing changed, the other CD3217 does not get hot. I checked for shorts around the CD3217s, but didn't find a shorted cap. Any idea what it could be? Just to be clear it is the same with the board in or out of the MacBook."
