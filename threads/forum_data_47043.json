Noticed a build up of corrosion around <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> which appears to be where <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is created, and a blown Diode <DIODE>D6902</DIODE>.\n\nFirst thing I did was give device an ultrasonic cleaning to remove the corrosion to get a better look. After which, I replaced <DIODE>D6902</DIODE> since it was severely blown. Images of before and after cleaning attached below. Device still would not boot, so I then applied alcohol around there area and injected 3V using a DCPS on to <DIODE>D6902</DIODE> and discovered that <CAPACITOR>C6906</CAPACITOR> was shorted. I have removed and replaced the shorted <CAPACITOR>C6906</CAPACITOR>, however device still does not boot.\n\n<CHIP>U7000</CHIP> is sending 5V to <SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> to Pin 10 on <CHIP>U6903</CHIP>. (Is this voltage too high?)\nPin 2 on <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> is being supplied 4.2V from <DIODE>D6902</DIODE>, however <DIODE>D6902</DIODE> is being supplied 5.2V on <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>.\nI believe <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> is bad and is pulling down voltage.\nPin 9 on <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> <SIGNAL>P3V3G3H_FB</SIGNAL> is outputting 0.66V,\nPin 3 on <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> <SIGNAL>P3V3G3H_LX</SIGNAL> Is outputting 2.2V.\n\nUSB-C Ammeter reads 5.2V with .0A consumption. I applied some more alcohol around <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> and injected 3V on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> with a .05A Consumption. I am currently waiting for some replacement <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> to arrive, but until then, any suggestions on what else I should be looking for? If <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> truly is bad, I found some replacements on DigiKey.com\n\nThank you in advance!"
