            "message": "Have this board that at the beginning was shutting down very randomly. Had a minor hint of liquid on <CAPACITOR>C2643</CAPACITOR>. Replaced it, and its still shutting down very randomly. Come to find out that its not so random after all.\nWhen board is plugged in and its running, if i tap my finger in the <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> section thats when it shuts down. I have reflowed the area and I dont really see how tapping on that are would cause the shutdown because its not a BGA chip. Unless its actually a solder ball under the RAM chip or the CPU that is damaged and the tapping in this area is actually causing  the shutdown. I have tapped on the RAM chips themselves with no shutdown. Not sure what to do here. Should I try to reflow the RAM closest to <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>?\n\n\nThanks"
