Does show the dead battery symbol when you plug it in. (I am using a known good OEM 96watt adapter) No liquid\n\nI unplugged battery, plugged in charger, 20v with a quick spike to 300mA then down to about 20mA\n\nSo, to explore this a little more, I connected a known good battery as well (this one was also close to depleted, as when I plugged the board into this battery, it also showed the dead battery symbol. However, with this battery, the current started to rise, and the battery was charging at about 4-4.5amps. The unit turned on normally.\n\nWeird, I thought, as I know this unit will turn on, with no battery, with a 96watt charger.\n\nSo I started taking measurements in line with this chart from logi.wiki\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://logi.wiki/images/6/6a/820-01598_Prometheus_Power_Sequence_Diagram_LO2.pdf[/URL]\n\nThis is where it gets weird for me. I am getting all the measurements I would expect, up until <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. It's not present. \n\nThis coming from the PMIC, my first thought was \"maybe bad PMIC\"\n\nMy hesitation comes from the fact that it will turn on, and charge with a known good battery. (even though it was also depleted enough not to turn on the computer right away, like the original)\n\nMy thought is, if it's a bad PMIC, why would it turn on with a known good battery, and not only the 96watt adapter \n\nThanks for the help in advance."
