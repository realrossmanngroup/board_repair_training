        "A1297": "What is A1297? A1297 is a model number for a 17 inch size MacBook Pro Unibody from years Early 2009, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011 with EMC 2272, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2390, 820-2610, 820-2849, 820-2914..",
        "820-2390": "What is 820-2390? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7201": "What is U7201? U7201 is responsible for the 3.3v and 5v power rails on many devices..",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "P5VS3_EN": "What is P5VS3_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "C7771": "What is C7771? Tantalum capacitor on 820-2330 and 820-2532 logic boards that often dies and causes PP1V05_S5_MCP or PP1V05_S5 to be 0.331v instead of 1.05v. If heating this cap restores voltage to this rail, replace."
