It happens in any system. Any applications that are open when you come out of sleep will just shut down and then the computer will stop responding. It works fine otherwise. I posted the last events recorded in the console below. I've replaced the Airport card with no luck. I thought it fixed it as it seemed to be running ok after the card swap, and then it crashed again. I'm stuck on this one. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:31.838 PM powerd[54]: BUG in libdispatch: 15G31 - 1718 - 0x0[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:31.000 PM kernel[0]: IOCTL not recognized: 234 out of 236[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:33.002 PM Safari[388]: tcp_connection_destination_handle_tls_close_notify 13 closing socket due to TLS CLOSE_NOTIFY alert[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:33.002 PM Safari[388]: tcp_connection_tls_session_error_callback_imp 13 __tcp_connection_tls_session_callback_write_block_ invoke.434 error 32[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:33.004 PM Safari[388]: tcp_connection_destination_handle_tls_close_notify 10 closing socket due to TLS CLOSE_NOTIFY alert[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:33.004 PM Safari[388]: tcp_connection_tls_session_error_callback_imp 10 __tcp_connection_tls_session_callback_write_block_ invoke.434 error 32[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:33.716 PM Safari[388]: tcp_connection_tls_session_error_callback_imp 9 __tcp_connection_tls_session_callback_write_block_ invoke.434 error 22[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:34.000 PM kernel[0]: PM response took 3124 ms (54, powerd)[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:34.000 PM kernel[0]: kern_open_file_for_direct_io(28)[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:34.000 PM kernel[0]: kern_open_file_for_direct_io took 0 ms[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:34.000 PM kernel[0]: error 0xe00002db opening polled file[\/FONT]\n[FONT=Helvetica]8\/17\/16 5:10:34.000 PM kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx:PowerChange: System Sleep [\/FONT]"}

Which type of flux do you recommend? I've been trying to use Amtech 559 and heat it up to liquify it but I don't ever really get it to go under the chip fully. I have Kester liquid flux too, but I feel like I'm killing everyone I work with when I use that. Is there another liquid flux you use?"}
