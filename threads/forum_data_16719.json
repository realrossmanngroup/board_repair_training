        "message":"If a board (let's say an 820-3437 for this specific thread) isn't powering on, but the SMC is being powered properly, ppbus_g3h is normal (8.58v), pp3v42_g3h is normal (3.44v), pp3v3_s5 is present, pp5v_s5 is present, the clock is good and ppvrtc_g3h is 3.3v, there's no damage to the board, no liquid damage evident or visible, PM_SLP_SUS_L is present (3.3v) but PM_SLP_S5_L is missing (and the CPU is not warm, no activity), is it safe to assume the CPU has failed? Is there anything else in order to confirm the CPU is dead? I have a growing stack of boards with these exact symptoms, and I'm fairly certain they've all got dead CPUs, but I'm always optimistic that I've just overlooked something and may repair them in the future.\n\nI'm about to start digging into these guys as parts boards if the above symptoms do sound like dead CPUs. :)"
