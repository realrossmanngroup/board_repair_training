I ultrasonic the board since I had no clue, it worked fine afterwards.been testing it for 2 days running benchmarks seem ok. Today, I got another one exactly the same issue. This one has a brand new display installed by Apple few days later this occurred. Anyone has an idea what causes it? Looks like Ram or cpu issue?
