Green-> Orange lights PPBUS present but every 5-6 seconds logic board is making a clicking noise in L7130 area and PPBUS is going down to 3-4V than again 17V. \n\nPP3V42_G3H - OK\nPPVRTC_G3H - OK\nPP5V_S5 - OK \nPP3V3_S5 -OK\n\nALL_SYS_PWRGD is 3.3 right when the board is clicking, after 0V.  Almost all reails have variations while it is clicking. SOme of that more than other. \n\n\nIt was water damaged ISL 629 area that had been cleaned and repaired all traces and components. \n\n\nThanks."}
