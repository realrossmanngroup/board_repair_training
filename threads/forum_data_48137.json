        "820-3536": "What is 820-3536? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "C7125": "What is C7125? Capacitor between CHGR_BOOT and CHGR_PHASE important for bootstrapping creation of PPBUS_G3H on 2013-2015 macbook pros.",

        "R7150": "What is R7150? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7152": "What is R7152? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging.."

Green-> Orange lights PPBUS present but every 5-6 seconds logic board is making a clicking noise in L7130 area and PPBUS is going down to 3-4V than again 17V. \n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - OK\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> - OK\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> - OK \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> -OK\n\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is 3.3 right when the board is clicking, after 0V.  Almost all reails have variations while it is clicking. SOme of that more than other. \n\n\nIt was water damaged ISL 629 area that had been cleaned and repaired all traces and components. \n\n\nThanks."
