What are these acronyms such as TBT TBD and MLB mean?\nHow these sensors works? All I can see on the schematics are BJT transistors. Are these BJTs actual thermal sensors? The lines are mutual for a couple of sensors so it is possible that one sensor causing problem and reporting multiple sensors failure.\nActually, the laptop has a problem, full speed fan and Facetime cannot work with message to wait until macbook cools down. So, temperature sensor near camera is failed. Is it possible to remove a resistor or make a jumper in order to bypass this. Fan is currently controled by Macs Fan control and laptop works OK. Zoom also works and camera is OK. There is no place on the computer that is heating, I checked this multiple times, so information about high temperature is fake.\n\nI need a way to bypass this since I don't want to prevent me from normal using of the laptop. The laptop is not working slow."

Does BJT starts conduction when temperature is high or something else? On the schematics, I can see that base and collector of BJT are shorted, and for the NPN transistor voltage between B and E should be above some trehold value in order transistor to start conducting (under assumption that collector is on positive potential).\n\nIn this case I have a clear sensor fail issue, since there is no spot on the board that is getting hot. From other posts I can see that these sensors fail upscale which means that temperature reading is above 100 degC"

I have unplugged the touchpad flex cable 593-1604-B from the logic board, but same (in total 5) sensors still reported the same errors (128 deg C). I used external mouse and keyboard during this test and rhe same sensors are reported with high readings. Is it now reasonable to assume that the problem i most likely not caused by the trackpad? The swap of trackpads is not possible, there is a screw damage problem."
