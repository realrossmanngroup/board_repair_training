        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",

The PCH die gets warm but the CPU die is cold even though it's getting its 1.7V.\n\nThe only clue I have is that <SIGNAL>MEM_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is .1V which I guess is a bad value.\nI am not getting the beeping sound for the RAM.\n\nThe <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> area is good and all voltages are present including <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL>.\n\nAny idea where I could look?"
