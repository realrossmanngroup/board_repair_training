The PCH die gets warm but the CPU die is cold even though it's getting its 1.7V.\n\nThe only clue I have is that mem_reset_l is .1V which I guess is a bad value.\nI am not getting the beeping sound for the RAM.\n\nThe U1950 area is good and all voltages are present including PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK.\n\nAny idea where I could look?"}
