Now i think it will be the <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> bios chip, we have 2 donor boards, one of them have a good loking <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>, but atm i dont have the programmer, do i start that way? to remove <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>, read it out and program the bios chip, or if the bios chip is damaged it would not even try to boot?"
