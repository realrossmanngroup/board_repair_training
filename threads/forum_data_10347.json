C3577 looked really terrible so I pulled that. I don't think I am supposed to ask this but I have tried finding it online about how to measure PP3V42_G3H and PPBUS_G3H but I am not sure. If I measure PP3V42_G3H at L6995 then it is 3.478.  If I can measure ppbus_g3h on F9700 then it is 12.26.\nI hope this is right info I am giving you. This is my first real try to fix a board."}
