        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "C3577": "What is C3577? a CAPACITOR.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  ."

I don't think I am supposed to ask this but I have tried finding it online about how to measure <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> but I am not sure. If I measure <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> at L6995 then it is 3.478.  If I can measure <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> on F9700 then it is 12.26.\nI hope this is right info I am giving you. This is my first real try to fix a board."
