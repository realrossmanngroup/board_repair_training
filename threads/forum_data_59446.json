I found corrosion on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> supply, I replaced the bad components and still no light on charger. I tried reflow SMC without success, and I finally had a light on charger after replacing the SMC with a working one. Now I have light on charger but still no fan spin. I finally found out something that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is present on the board but it's shorted...\n\nI don't know if it's shorted since the beginning but I tried to remove the SMC, also <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> and every component attach to <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> and I still have the short. I also looked for broken traces and bad resistances value, found nothing. I finally throw it in the ultrasonic cleaner but still shorted.\n\nIt's a dead board to me but if you have any advice I would be glad to hear it :) Thanks"
