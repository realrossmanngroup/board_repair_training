At the beginning I had no light on charger and no fan spin, no more historic. I found corrosion on PP3V42_G3H supply, I replaced the bad components and still no light on charger. I tried reflow SMC without success, and I finally had a light on charger after replacing the SMC with a working one. Now I have light on charger but still no fan spin. I finally found out something that PP3V3_S5 is present on the board but it's shorted...\n\nI don't know if it's shorted since the beginning but I tried to remove the SMC, also U7501 and every component attach to PP3V3_S5 and I still have the short. I also looked for broken traces and bad resistances value, found nothing. I finally throw it in the ultrasonic cleaner but still shorted.\n\nIt's a dead board to me but if you have any advice I would be glad to hear it :) Thanks"}

The short is 22ohms. When I lift L7560 the short is on PIN 2 and when U7501 lift up the short is only on PIN17, it looks like the short is on PP3V3_S5_REG_R. When I remove components I put them back in place after I checked the short still there, i do it page by page, don't know if it is a good methodology.... Every caps and resistors on page 54 are fine."}

I don't have any lab supply yet and I tried with the MagSafe and an IR camera, the only hot point is under PCH (or the other side of the board I don't know). CPU heatsink was already removed."}

I know it's a pain in the ass to reattach a CPU to a motherboard but I have time to spend on it and it worth the try as I have some junk 820-3437-B. Do you know where I could find a stencil to reball a CPU for this board ?"}
