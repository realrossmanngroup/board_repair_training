            "message": "i have a clients board. something got stuck in headphone jack. and sound was not working either. when you toggle the volume up and down it would have the forbidden sign. replaced jack. and sound works fine. no more forbidden sign. laptop can see headphone jack when i plug it in when the computer starts or when i put in sleep mode. but headphone jack is not being recognized when i unplug and plug in . music plays on speaker rather than headphones. was wondering if anyone would know what the issue might be\n\nthanks in advance"
