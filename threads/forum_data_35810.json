            "message": "Macbook air 2012 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1465</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, came with sporadical shutdown problem. After 3-5 minutes of high load, the laptop shuts down and then works 20-30 seconds till shutdown unless cooled for a while. Since CPU/GPU were under 60Â°C, i checked all voltages and some reset signals, on board and found funny slow linear voltage drop on <SIGNAL>RTC_RESET</SIGNAL>, changed batteries in my multimeter and immediately confirmed it with a brilliant solution by Dukefawks from this forum.\nAfter i changed both caps, it started to work and here comes the stupid one.\nTo test the board with the battery i used <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL> jumper near the wlan card. I was too stupid to check if there's something dangerous around it and i guess i shorted <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL> with damn <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3HOT_CHRG_REG</SIGNAL> on <CAPACITOR>C7045</CAPACITOR> which is happened to be just near this jumper. IDK if apple considers electrical safety but although i feel retarded enough for my mistake, i found it rather funny that they put 8V hot power rail just in 2mm from the power jumper, without even putting some sort of compound or glue.\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\topenboardview_2018-06-<SIGNAL>14_20</SIGNAL>-32-14.png Views:\t1 Size:\t384.9 KB ID:\t35811\"]35811._xfImport[/ATTACH]\nPic 1. Apple trap for big tweezers in shaky hands. \n\nNow i'm having 1.7V on <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL>, Keyboard power button drops it to 1.3V, and, of course, shorting it to ground does not turn the laptop on anymore, it starts only if i plug the charger in.\nI am really pissed off with my stupidity but i am asking for some help.\nUnfortunately, it's not <CAPACITOR>C5734</CAPACITOR> shorting to ground.\nHowever, i found that <RESISTOR>R5070</RESISTOR> is nearly 1kOhm (10kOhm in schematics) in circuit. Is that possible that on higher load SMD resistors melt to lower resistance? Should i start searching for a new SMC and <CHIP>U5010</CHIP>, or it simply shorts my PP3V42 rail instead of turning it on?\n\nAlso, note to self: check <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL> area for high power rails before you take your dirty tweezers in hand."

PC laptops are far more repairable in this sense - when IO chip dies, it is almost always available without donor board lottery and can be pre-programmed with Vertyanov jig just like a normal flash chip, so it's almost never a big deal. :)"
