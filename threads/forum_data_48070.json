Something that very commonly happens on these newer Airs is that D7012 fails and prevents voltage from passing through Q7010. I'd replace it first"}

There's not much else here that can cause that unless DCIN_ISOL is shorted. Another thing that can happen is broken trace between D7012 and R7010. Also bad Q7010 is possible."}
