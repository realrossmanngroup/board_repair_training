        "A1707": "What is A1707? A1707 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3072, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00281, 820-00928..",
        "820-00281": "What is 820-00281? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",

        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance â€“ this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",
        "PPVCCIO_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCIO_S0_CPU? PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is a power rail responsible for powering the part of the CPU responsible for communicating with other portions of the machine prior to PPVCORE_S0_CPU being present and must be present before vcore, PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is present when the machine is in an on, RUNNING state. ."

No sign of magic smoke or apparent damaged component.\nThe Macbook doesn't want to turn on anymore (screen, keyboard and touch-bar stays black). I do have fans spin and track-pad feels clicky when powered on. A long press on the touchID button turn it off.
