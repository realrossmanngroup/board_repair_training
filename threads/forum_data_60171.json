One one USB-C port, 5v @ 0.001amp. The 2nd port would flash on\/off\/on\/off. \n\nI replaced U3200 and a couple of the small caps and resistors in that area that looked gross. Now, both USB-C ports show 5v @ 0.03amp, but occasionally it will flash on\/off\/on\/off on the one port still. \n\nI'm getting my LDO outputs on both CD3215s. \n\nTBT_PWR_EN is 0v. Should I be following this or am I barking up the wrong tree?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nJeff"}
