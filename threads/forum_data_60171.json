        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

The 2nd port would flash on/off/on/off. \n\nI replaced <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> and a couple of the small caps and resistors in that area that looked gross. Now, both USB-C ports show 5v @ 0.03amp, but occasionally it will flash on/off/on/off on the one port still. \n\nI'm getting my LDO outputs on both CD3215s. \n\n<SIGNAL>TBT_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is 0v.
