There was corrosion on the board underside, which I cleaned up and does not appear to be in any SSD-related areas (Thunderbolt, screen backlight). There's also what looks like a small burn hole on the board topside right under the SSD (which leads me to believe that something on the original SSD had exploded).. I scraped the hole area but no vias of importance seem to run through there.\n\nI've never had to fix SSD-relate issues, so any pointers would be helpful."
