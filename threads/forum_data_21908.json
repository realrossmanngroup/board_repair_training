        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

            "message": "Hello,\n\nFeeling stumped on this one. No backlight. \nFuse at F7700 OK. <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> backlight driver was shorted to ground.\nNo voltage getting past <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> at all. Voltage at pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is 9.83 volts. Pin 3 is at 9.55 volts.\nResistance at <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR> is 300K. <CAPACITOR>C7782</CAPACITOR> is not shorted open. Pins 1,2,5,6 are at 0 volts.\n\nI replaced the backlight driver IC <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>. Figured that <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> was bad and replaced, along with <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7782</CAPACITOR>. \nRemoved <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> temporarily to isolate the MOSFET and still 0 volts on output.\n\nI am stumped. Voltage on pin 3 should be much lower than pin 4 for the gate to function I believe, but I cant seem to find what I am missing.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks,\n\nStefan"
