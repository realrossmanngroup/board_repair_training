No backlight. \nFuse at F7700 OK. U7701 backlight driver was shorted to ground.\nNo voltage getting past Q7706 at all. Voltage at pin 4 of Q7706 is 9.83 volts. Pin 3 is at 9.55 volts.\nResistance at R7788 is 300K. C7782 is not shorted open. Pins 1,2,5,6 are at 0 volts.\n\nI replaced the backlight driver IC U7701. Figured that Q7706 was bad and replaced, along with R7788 and C7782. \nRemoved R7789 temporarily to isolate the MOSFET and still 0 volts on output.\n\nI am stumped. Voltage on pin 3 should be much lower than pin 4 for the gate to function I believe, but I cant seem to find what I am missing.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks,\n\nStefan"}

Pin # 5 EDP_BKLT_EN is shorted to ground. \nRemoved Q7707 and retested to be sure.\n\nPretty sure this is done then.\n\nCleaning in ultrasonic just in case I am extra lucky, but I doubt it.\n\nThanks,\n\nStefan"}
