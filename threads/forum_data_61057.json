            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, came to me taking 20-21 miliamps with just power connected, when connected to power board it showed red/green light and took 24-26 miliamps.\n\nI measured all rails, and all seemed good except for <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4</SIGNAL>, and thought it was a corrupt ME or something like that. IT WAS, however now that it turns on, it is taking anywhere from 800 mah to almost 2 amps. When connected to power, it sometimes skyrockets up to 2 amps, sometimes it will stay below 1 amp, and sometimes it stop at 26 mah (connected to power board). SMC bypass does work however no effect, no image, fast fan spin too but only for no more than 20 seconds and then it shuts off and goes back to 26 mah.\n\nCPU gets extremely hot too, like hotter than normal 3437's. CPU voltage is 1.7V on startup too, and does not change. Any known solution im not knowing about?"
