I had quite an high number of SSD short with no repair. mostly of them 15inch board o 16 inch board from 2017 - 2019.\n\nSo my question is if there is a solutions to this and is possible to succeed on them. And if it applies to all the board with ssd on board.\n\nThanks in advance"}

(00850)U8900->U9400(01700).\nThen remove the NANDs from left side SSD (U8600-900) and their power supplies.\n\nYou can play with SSD capacity in some limits.\nFor example 256GB, to 512GBB (standard version), changing all the chips accordingly.\nBut the boards with 1-8TB SSD have special T2, customized.\nYou can change between 1 to 8TB, but not from 512GB to 2TB for example (requires T2 changing too).\n\nAfter NANDs changed, machine should automatically start in Recovery mode; detected in AC2, without pressing any key for DFU.\nIf not, something went wrong in the process."}
