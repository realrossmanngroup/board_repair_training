I had quite an high number of SSD short with no repair. mostly of them 15inch board o 16 inch board from 2017 - 2019.\n\nSo my question is if there is a solutions to this and is possible to succeed on them. And if it applies to all the board with ssd on board.\n\nThanks in advance"

            "message": "Yes is possible; many videos available on Internet.\n\nYou must solder the NANDs in correct order, this is very important.\nFor example, once you've removed <CHIP>U8600</CHIP> chip from donor board, must solder it in the same <CHIP>U8600</CHIP> place on the target board.\nThis is valid for swapping from exact same model board.\n\nFor 01700 need to pay atention, if you want to use NANDs from different donor model, as 00850 for example.\nIf both machines had 512GB, 01700 has only 5 chips mounted; <CHIP>U8600</CHIP> and <CHIP>U9100</CHIP>-400.\nIn such case, place the 00850 chips in ascending order (on 01700 board), starting with <CHIP>U9100</CHIP>; (00850)<CHIP>U8600</CHIP>-> <CHIP>U9100</CHIP>(01700)... (00850)<CHIP>U8900</CHIP>-><CHIP>U9400</CHIP>(01700).\nThen remove the NANDs from left side SSD (<CHIP>U8600</CHIP>-900) and their power supplies.\n\nYou can play with SSD capacity in some limits.\nFor example 256GB, to 512GBB (standard version), changing all the chips accordingly.\nBut the boards with 1-8TB SSD have special T2, customized.\nYou can change between 1 to 8TB, but not from 512GB to 2TB for example (requires T2 changing too).\n\nAfter NANDs changed, machine should automatically start in Recovery mode; detected in AC2, without pressing any key for DFU.\nIf not, something went wrong in the process."
