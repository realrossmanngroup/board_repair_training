I dont get orange light though. I do have 3.42v, PPBUS is 12.31V with and without battery connected. I get fanspin with battery connected when I connect magsafe. When disconnect magsafe it can keep runing on battery alone. When only the battery is connected shorting <CAPACITOR>C5710</CAPACITOR> will not start it up.\n\nI replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> same result\nResistance between pin 17/18 <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> = 3ohm\nBetween 27/28 = 20ohm\n<RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR> is 2K and <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> is 2Kohm\n\nWhen turned on I have 3.43v on both pins of <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR>\nOn <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> pin 1 = 3.43 and on pin two it switches between 3.43 and 0.2 not sure what it should be?SMC area looks pretty neat so havent done anything yet, like reflow.\n\nWhat more to check?"
