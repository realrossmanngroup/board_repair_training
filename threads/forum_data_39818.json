        "message":"Hi guys i have an 820-3115 that had a corroded C7156 and little burn damage in the board, made a wire from pin 1 to pin 1 from C7562 and that seem to have done the job as I got fanspin. I dont get orange light though. I do have 3.42v, PPBUS is 12.31V with and without battery connected. I get fanspin with battery connected when I connect magsafe. When disconnect magsafe it can keep runing on battery alone. When only the battery is connected shorting C5710 will not start it up.\n\nI replaced U7000 same result\nResistance between pin 17\/18 U7000 = 3ohm\nBetween 27\/28 = 20ohm\nR5281 is 2K and R5280 is 2Kohm\n\nWhen turned on I have 3.43v on both pins of R5281\nOn R5280 pin 1 = 3.43 and on pin two it switches between 3.43 and 0.2 not sure what it should be?SMC area looks pretty neat so havent done anything yet, like reflow.\n\nWhat more to check?"
