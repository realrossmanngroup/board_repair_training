PP3V3_S4 is 0.445V but then PP3V3_S3 is fine at 3.3V. I was under the impression there could be no S3 without S4..\nGoing down the rails the only other one that is OK is PP1V05_SUS at 1.03V.\n\nHistory unknown but I suspect liquid damage (clear water) as there are faint traces of water stains on the board. Not clear enough to make out where they may have gone. No corrosion and apart from a bit of dust the board is immaculate.\n\nLooking into S4_PWR_EN I see it's created by U8170 but U8170 is a NOSTUFF. So where is S4_PWR_EN created?"}

A lot more power rails should be present then too."}
