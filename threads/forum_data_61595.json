They used it two times and on the third time it didn't turn on.\n\nThis machine was babied by the owner. The board is super clean, no corrosion, liquid spill or noticeably damaged components.\n\nTested the charge, it takes 20v and 0.03A. Removed the board and connected to power. Below are the measurements.\n\nUSB Meter: 20v 0.03A\n20.11v PPDCIN_G3H\n0.002v PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG (F7000, C7051, C7050 all show the same)\n0.002v PPBUS_G3H (F7000)\n\n\nWhat do?"
