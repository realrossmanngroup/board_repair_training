        "A1708": "What is A1708? A1708 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2017, 2016 with EMC 3164, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00840, 820-00875..",
        "820-00875": "What is 820-00875? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG": "What is PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG? This is battery power that flows to the system AFTER it has gone through a current sense resistor, before it goes through a fuse to become PPBUS_G3H power rail. .",
        "C7050": "What is C7050? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for battery current sensing, you should measure around 2.202 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "C7051": "What is C7051? a CAPACITOR.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "R6999": "What is R6999? a RESISTOR.",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR? This is the input that comes from the charger..",
        "PM_EN_P3V3_G3H": "What is PM_EN_P3V3_G3H? PM_EN_P3V3_G3H is a signal that enables the PP3V3_G3H rail to turn on. This comes out of ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip; when missing, often is missing because of a bad ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip. .",
