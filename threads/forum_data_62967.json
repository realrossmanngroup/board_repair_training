Fan spins at full speed.\n\nI install hwmonitor and CPU 1, CPU 2 and memory proximity shows 129°.\n\n<CHIP>U5800</CHIP> area  looks fine, no water near it. Traces to <TRANSISTOR>Q5810</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q5860</TRANSISTOR> have continuity. With webcam unplug same problem.\n\nIf I keep hwmonitor open, sometimes shows T° correctly for a couple of seconds, but even if sensor shows the right temperature fan keeps at full speed.\n\nSMC area also don´t have water damage near.\n\nPlease tell me if I'm missing some test or if I should change <CHIP>U5800</CHIP> or SMC?\nThanks"
