        "message":"Hi, I receive a water damage board. \nAfter cleaning the board and changing the trackpad flex. Fan spins at full speed.\n\nI install hwmonitor and CPU 1, CPU 2 and memory proximity shows 129\u00b0.\n\nU5800 area  looks fine, no water near it. Traces to Q5810 and Q5860 have continuity. With webcam unplug same problem.\n\nIf I keep hwmonitor open, sometimes shows T\u00b0 correctly for a couple of seconds, but even if sensor shows the right temperature fan keeps at full speed.\n\nSMC area also don\u00b4t have water damage near.\n\nPlease tell me if I'm missing some test or if I should change U5800 or SMC?\nThanks"

Same problem.\nR5360 and R5361 are good, 2k resistance each.\n\nI also test a known good board with the LIO flex\/board and trackpad flex\/board of the water damaged board and all works fine, fan at normal speed.\n\nSo problem is in the board.\nWater damage was in the trackpad conector and in the BL caps and diode. I didn't find other areas with visible damaged.\n\nCan U5800 get damaged, because of the trackpad conector corrosion?"

Not sure if you still can do that in Mojave.\n\nI also remove the silicone from SMC and apply heat (240 C\u00b0)  with flux to the SMC. And did another ultrasonic cleaning, to see if I was lucky.\n\nIs that PECI sensor related with U5800, maybe I need to change that again?"
