But no boot and no power.\n\nhas anyone got any recommendation as to what I can do about this.\nThe board originally had water damage around <RESISTOR>R1661</RESISTOR> the test point for <RESISTOR>R1661</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1663</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1669</RESISTOR> were completely corroded.\n\n <RESISTOR>R1663</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1662</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1664</RESISTOR> have been removed.\nbut I dont see how they could cause <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> to heat up so much.\n\nany suggestions or advice is appreciated \nthanks"
