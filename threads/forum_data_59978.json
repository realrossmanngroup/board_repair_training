The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",

Instead, it starts for about 10 seconds, stops briefly and then spins continuously. \n\nAll <SIGNAL>S_0</SIGNAL> rails are present, but <SIGNAL>PPVVC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is a bit low (1.7V, should be 1.8V). <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL> out of <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> is present. The following have been replaced: SMC, clock chip (<CHIP>U1900</CHIP>), and BIOS chip. Still no boot after replacement. The following signals are all present: <SIGNAL>PM_DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL>. From reading through previous threads, it seems like the next logical thing to do would be to upload a new good BIOS to the computer (I believe I will have to do this anyway since I replaced the BIOS chip). Could someone please outline the steps I need to take in order to do this as well as provide the file? \n\nOne other thing of note: <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> has been mentioned in past posts. This chip does heat up noticeably when the board is powered on, but not to the point that I can't keep my finger on it."

The computer has exactly the same symptoms as before... fan spins, stops and then just keeps spinning. No boot.\n\n<SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is still missing. At the top of pg. 13 of the schematic (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>), it shows the signals going into the PCH that are required to obtain <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL>. I have all of the required inputs. I decided to apply some flux to the PCH and heat. I kept heating for about 15 seconds after the flux started to bubble. After doing this the computer still would not boot. \n\nThe last thing I tried was wiring 3.3V to <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> to force it to be present (I first checked for a short to ground on the line... there wasn't one). After forcing 3.3V into <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL>, the computer still will not boot. \n\nSuggestions?"
