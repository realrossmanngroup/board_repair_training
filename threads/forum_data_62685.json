        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed ‚Äì if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

I found out that I ve knocked out the sensor of trackpad. But now I have realised that computer does not wake up after lid closed and opened. It stays on black screen. The computert keeps working and I realised that my power button also does not work after I open the lid to shut down the computer. Any idea where it can happen from?"
