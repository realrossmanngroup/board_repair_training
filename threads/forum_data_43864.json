            "message": "Original issue was GPU panic fault causing image to suddenly stop feeding to the display. The customer tried desoldering the <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> but ended up bridging a couple pins and yanking off a couple resistors and capacitors. During which the GPU ended up getting fried, resistance measurements of PP1V5R1V35_GPU_REG was reading short. Pulled GPU and short is missing. \n\nCurrently i have <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and GPU pulled, but whenever i apply power to the board, i keep popping <CAPACITOR>C8963</CAPACITOR>. Confirmed no short is present. Once i replace the capacitor, i get a resistance reading of about 18k ohms. Is the keeping the GPU and <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> out of the circuit the reason for <CAPACITOR>C8963</CAPACITOR> popping?"
