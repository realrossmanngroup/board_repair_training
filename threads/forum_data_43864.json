        "message":"Original issue was GPU panic fault causing image to suddenly stop feeding to the display. The customer tried desoldering the U8900 but ended up bridging a couple pins and yanking off a couple resistors and capacitors. During which the GPU ended up getting fried, resistance measurements of PP1V5R1V35_GPU_REG was reading short. Pulled GPU and short is missing. \n\nCurrently i have U8900 and GPU pulled, but whenever i apply power to the board, i keep popping C8963. Confirmed no short is present. Once i replace the capacitor, i get a resistance reading of about 18k ohms. Is the keeping the GPU and U8900 out of the circuit the reason for C8963 popping?"
