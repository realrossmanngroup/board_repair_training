            "message": "Hi Guys,\n\nI recently purchased a \"new\" <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3462A</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board (for the 2013 mbp retina) and for some reason my OSX installation went perfectly ok, but when I boot I get all sorts of weird artifacts on the login screen and when I move windows around quickly. I've already reinstalled twice and upgraded to High Sierra (from ml). The artifacts only occur in places that are \"blurred\", like the login page, or the top of a window.\n\nWhen I boot back into recovery mode and drag the safari window quickly, it doesn't happen. I also tried safe mode and it works perfectly fine. Any thoughts?\n\nI also upgraded to High Sierra (since the drive came with mountain lion) and am experiencing the same issue, if not worse.\n\nMy thoughts:\n* Tried thunderbolt and hdmi external monitors, both experience same issue.\n* Perhaps the GPU? But there is not discrete gpu in this board, its integrated to CPU, so wouldn't my OS not load at all?\n* Apple Hardware Test throws a code 4hdd/11 for hard drive, but this could cause artifacts?\n* Heat Gun the PCH? (haha just kidding, don't kill me...)\n\nI'm running out of ideas to try...if its a random capacitor that's blown I'll never find it, the board looks squeaky clean.\n\n\n\nThanks,\nRohit"
