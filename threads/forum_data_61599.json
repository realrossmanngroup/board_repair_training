I repaired the corrosion as well as some bad traces arounf this connector, then tested for any shorts. I then cleaned the board with my ultrasonic cleaner. After complete dry and reassembly, I now have a direct short to ground (2ohm @ 6A) on PP3V3_S5 line. I have attempted to find the short by running 3V to the line on the board (at C7592) and then spraying alcohol, but I cannot see it or feel it. Where do I go from here?"}
