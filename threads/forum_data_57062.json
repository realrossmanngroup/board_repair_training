U3100 replaced with the same model B01 but from another donor board that had 20V on charger.\n3. All big coils 0V. PPBUS_G3H - 0V. P3V3G3H - 0V.\n4. Checked for short on all the big coils. L7210, L7230, L7410, L7430 seem to be shorted. shows 16 in diode mode and gives a constant beep.\nPlease advice how to proceed."}
