        "message":"First post on this forum, so excuse me if I leave something important out. Checked a bunch of other posts and didn't see anything related to this, so....\n\nI have a mid 2012 board that only turns on if you hold the power button down. I'll get a small fan spin from a click, but in order to get it to do anything more I have to hold it down till it's nearly completely booted. I can boot off battery and the power cord both individually, and together. Being plugged in without the battery in results in me having to hold the power through the 5 light \"where's your battery\" thing, as well as the rest of the boot.\nAfter it actually boots, it works, but EXTREMELY slowly.\nAs far as i'm aware nothing has been spilled on this computer, but I did get it off eBay, so, something was probably spilled on it...\n\nI ran the ASD and it failed at IPBR\n\nSensor - Current (IPBR) -- Charger BMON (Prod) (test 1) - Sensor Range Reads Within Operating Range\n- Check to ensure sensor reads within operating range.\nERROR - Sensor is reading above the high limit\n- T E S T  F A I L E D -\n\n\nAndddd that's about where I got to.\n\nI've already ran the board through an ultrasonic cleaning, but other than that i'm pretty much lost. My initial thought was that I wasn't getting ENOUGH voltage considering it was running so slow, but I'm new to this so everything I think is wrong anyway. Oh well.\n\n\nAnyone have any tips? I do have all the tools required to do any of the repairs, along with donor boards for parts, but I don't have a schematic or board viewing software yet, so any components you mention if you coulda sorta just... \"this thing, it's in the top like 2 inches of the board\", that'd help me greatly. I should be able to figure out where everything is if I have a general idea of where the component is.\n\nThanks in advance!"

The 100% CPU usage is gone, but the long start up hold is still required. The catch to this is that it will only work if the battery is unplugged. I still get the same trouble while the battery is attached (regardless whether it's plugged in to the charger or not as well), but nothing caught on fire, so I guess we'll consider it neutral...\n\nAnyway, i'm not able to get back to the computer with all my helpful doodads to show me what i'm doing in any way till tomorrow, but with the new situation does that still sound like measuring there would be of any help? I've felt around the area (with the battery plugged in, and on wall power alone) and nothing seems to be getting hot anywhere near there, but I did notice a high pitched sound coming from the area slightly above the battery connector. The sound is only there when the battery is plugged in. Besides all the crap near U7000 nothing else on the board looks off at all, especially in the area the whine is coming from. I have no clue if this helped narrow down the problem or just made it even bigger, but if anything, at least I can use it without a battery now!"
