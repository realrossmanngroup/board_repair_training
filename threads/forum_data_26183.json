The board itself is very soft under <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>, like working on paper mach√©. Pins 2,3,4 I can get back with jumper wire but 8,9,13,14 I have no idea how to go about that. Is this worth sending somewhere else to have fixed or is this not worth the trouble?

            "message": "This looks more like it was destroyed by means of soldering wick and poking with the iron. Do the middle pads still have conductivity to the points they need to go? Check BV and schematic and beep them out with the meter. If the middle pads are fucked I would say this board is done. A bit of a shame as this seemed perfectly fixable from the first picture. I have never seen the middle pads destroyed like that by corrosion, only by wicking and scraping."
