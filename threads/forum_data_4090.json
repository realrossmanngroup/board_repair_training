I UC and the board started but would not detect the SSD drive.\n\nI connected a USB boot drive and started from there without issues until the system shut down before completely booting and is in boot loop ever since.\n\nI measured Y1905 and that is getting 0.9 to 1V and also all necessary voltages seem to be present at <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> but I cant measure 32Khz neither 25MHz coming from the chip.. the oscilloscope shows some irrelevant readings which jump around but not steady frequencies... also pins 15 (<SIGNAL>SYSCLK_CLK25M_TBT</SIGNAL>) and 16 looked a bit dodgy ...not shiny like the rest.\n\nBIOS chip area looks good, power comes to pin8.\n\nCould it be the clock chip since its so sensitive to water damage?\n\n\ngeorge"

After that everything seems normal.\n\nsee: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ0cXgLIpjg&feature=youtu.be[/url] (65 seconds video)\n\n\nSince this is still a mystery itd be nice to have some more ideas why its behaving like that..

It now works properly but it seems the SSD has issues - you cant install anything new to it. Works great with different SSD.\nthank you!"
