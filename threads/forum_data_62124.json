            "message": "Hello,\n\nCurrently working on the one from topic title with no audio device issue (originally won't boot).\n\nFirst of all, tried known working OS - no luck. Checked MLB under microscope and found that <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> looks strange - measured it and power bus was shorted to ground so I have removed <CHIP>U6400</CHIP>. I spotted underneath that someone has attempted to make some \"unsuccessful\" work here, found ripped off C5 pad (NC) and a bit corroded D5 pad (<SIGNAL>AUD_SPKRAMP_INT_L</SIGNAL>). Removed the signs of corrosion and tested MLB - still no audio device present. Replaced <CHIP>U6200</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R6228</RESISTOR> (this resistor looked like overheated and had only 20 Ohms despite it is 33 Ohms). Neext I found <SIGNAL>AUD_SPKRAMP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>HDA_RST_L</SIGNAL> to be High, power rails for <CHIP>U6200</CHIP> correct. <RESISTOR>R6203</RESISTOR> - 0V and no oscillograms on both pins, value 33 Ohm, 540mV on diode test (red probe to resistor, black to GND), shouldn't be some data visible over here?\n\nMy main question: should <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> be assembled to get the audio device visible in the OS? If not, what is the next step in diagnosing of such problem?"
