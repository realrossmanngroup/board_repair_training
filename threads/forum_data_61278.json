He said he was working on exams, he shut down the Mac and on the next morning, Mac didn't boot. He went to Apple, they said they can replace it under warranty but he would loose his data and that's not an option for him.\n\nWhen pressing power button, it does nothing. USB-C charging port give different result if you plug it  to right or left side. PVRAM, SMC doesn't help.\n\nThanks"}
