            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that has had its audio jack replaced elsewhere. Showing no audio devices in OSX (no chime either)\nI have replaced the codec (<CHIP>U6201</CHIP>) twice, and still pin 4 of J6600 (jack) is O/L instead of 780 ohms (same with both codec's) \n\nIve followed the line and found no bad traces (but have not checked the pad under the codec, but the BGA site looks clean without damage). \n\nIm not sure i want to lift the codec and have to re-ball again. But something is wrong. I am also worried because it shows no audio devices in system report.\nAnyone got any ideas?"
