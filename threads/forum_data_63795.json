Corrosion was especially present around <TRANSISTOR>Q7680</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7660</TRANSISTOR>. There was also corrosion around CC714 / CC715, CC716, CC717, CC7A0, CC8A1, <RESISTOR>R7686</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7666</RESISTOR>, CC760, CC761, CC786, CC787, <CAPACITOR>C7681</CAPACITOR>, CC789, CC788, <CAPACITOR>C7660</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7060</CAPACITOR>, CC784, CC785, <RESISTOR>R7070</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7071</RESISTOR>, <DIODE>D7070</DIODE>, CC796, <TRANSISTOR>Q7070</TRANSISTOR>, but not as bad as between <TRANSISTOR>Q7680</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7660</TRANSISTOR>.\n\nI'm not familiar with the MacBook Air yet; and I'm even less familiar with the after 2015 boards. That's the first one I see. I did read the [URL]https://repair.wiki/w/A2179_2020_MacBook_Air[/URL], and the below thread:\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01958</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a-model-<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2179</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>-water-damage.63359/[/URL]\n\n[ATTACH]61119[/ATTACH][ATTACH]61121[/ATTACH]\n\nMeasurements taken in the corroded areas, which I've cleaned:\n<RESISTOR>R7686</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7666</RESISTOR> reads 1.5 Ohms, seems okish.\n<RESISTOR>R7070</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7071</RESISTOR> are okish too.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: stable at 12.57V\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7660</TRANSISTOR>: 12.57V on pin 2, 5.11V on pin 3 and 4, 41.9mV on pin 5, 5.08V on pin 6,7,8\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7680</TRANSISTOR>: 12.58V on pin 2, 3.33V on pin 3 and 4, 3.3V pin 6, 7, 8, pin 5 83mV\nL7400: 1.8V, diode mode obviously does not beep and resistance is around 187 Ohms.\nL7230, L7220, L7210: 6.2mV\n\nI ordered a USB-C ampmeter, I'm clueless regarding how much mAh/Volts it takes.\n\nThe MacBook does not boot, there is no chime, there is no sign of life and the fan does not spin. The CPU area gets warm, though.\n\nThe sound starts to be audible ~10 sec after I press on \"On\".\n\nThe other side of the board was perfectly clean, no corrosion.\n\nThe customer said the water came from the back of the MacBook AIr. Someone spilled a glass of water behind it.\n\nSince the T2 chip is present on this model, I guess that if the macbook is unable to boot, data are lost? Data encryption keys being in the T2...would it be doable to unsolder both the T2 chip and the SSDs? Then what? Solder them back in another macbook ? Doesn't seem to be worth the troubles"
