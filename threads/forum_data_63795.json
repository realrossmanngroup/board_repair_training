Corrosion was especially present around Q7680 and Q7660. There was also corrosion around CC714 \/ CC715, CC716, CC717, CC7A0, CC8A1, R7686, R7666, CC760, CC761, CC786, CC787, C7681, CC789, CC788, C7660, C7060, CC784, CC785, R7070, R7071, D7070, CC796, Q7070, but not as bad as between Q7680 and Q7660.\n\nI'm not familiar with the MacBook Air yet; and I'm even less familiar with the after 2015 boards. That's the first one I see. I did read the [URL]https:\/\/repair.wiki\/w\/A2179_2020_MacBook_Air[\/URL], and the below thread:\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https:\/\/boards.rossmanngroup.com\/threads\/820-01958-a-model-a2179-water-damage.63359\/[\/URL]\n\n[ATTACH]61119[\/ATTACH][ATTACH]61121[\/ATTACH]\n\nMeasurements taken in the corroded areas, which I've cleaned:\nR7686 and R7666 reads 1.5 Ohms, seems okish.\nR7070 and R7071 are okish too.\n\nPPBUS_G3H: stable at 12.57V\nQ7660: 12.57V on pin 2, 5.11V on pin 3 and 4, 41.9mV on pin 5, 5.08V on pin 6,7,8\nQ7680: 12.58V on pin 2, 3.33V on pin 3 and 4, 3.3V pin 6, 7, 8, pin 5 83mV\nL7400: 1.8V, diode mode obviously does not beep and resistance is around 187 Ohms.\nL7230, L7220, L7210: 6.2mV\n\nI ordered a USB-C ampmeter, I'm clueless regarding how much mAh\/Volts it takes.\n\nThe MacBook does not boot, there is no chime, there is no sign of life and the fan does not spin. The CPU area gets warm, though.\n\nThe sound starts to be audible ~10 sec after I press on \"On\".\n\nThe other side of the board was perfectly clean, no corrosion.\n\nThe customer said the water came from the back of the MacBook AIr. Someone spilled a glass of water behind it.\n\nSince the T2 chip is present on this model, I guess that if the macbook is unable to boot, data are lost? Data encryption keys being in the T2...would it be doable to unsolder both the T2 chip and the SSDs? Then what? Solder them back in another macbook ? Doesn't seem to be worth the troubles"}

I would have expected 0.6V considering the boardview but I read 0.606 V only once.\n\nOn R7665 and R7685 I read 0.5 Ohm\nRegarding C7669 and C7689, sorry sir but my multimeter shows 100 nF on both, which is in line with the schematics showing 0.1uF.\nUnless the schematics must be considered as wrong, perhaps it is better to keep these 2caps in place."}
