The visible damage/corrosion on the Logic Board was minimal.\n\nThe only visible damage was located around the CPU/GPU Phase chips (<CHIP>U7220</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7230</CHIP>, QA340).. again very minimal, small amounts of white corrosion/oxidation.\n\nAll ports show [B]20v[/B] with [B]0A[/B] draw.\n\nThe only thermal activity on the board is the T2 and corresponding charging chips warming up.\n                       \n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12.6v                           \n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> - 12.6v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_GPU</SIGNAL> - 12.6v\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCIO_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0v\n[I]*Resistance measurements match good board on all CPU lines listed above*[/I]\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3_CPUDDR</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S0SW</SIGNAL> - 0v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> - 1.8v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> - 5.1v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_T</SIGNAL>- 3.3v\n\n\n\n\nPlease note the following:\n1. I have tested all the lines that show up as 0v for shorts to ground and all line readings match good board.\n2. I attempted T2 revive after cleaning visible corrosion and I get error [B]code 4010[/B], the fans go [B]full[/B] speed after failed T2 revive.\n3. I replaced [B]<CHIP>U7210</CHIP>[/B], [B]<CHIP>U7220</CHIP>[/B], [B]<CHIP>U7230</CHIP>[/B] and attempted T2 revive again and it still failed with 4010 and I still get 0V on all CPU rails\n4. I understand board may fall into the \"[I]brain dead[/I]\" category, however I want to cover all my bases and learn potential additional troubleshooting methods I could apply in this situation. It feels like the board should be repairable as the liquid damage was visibly very minimal.\n\nThank you for your time."
