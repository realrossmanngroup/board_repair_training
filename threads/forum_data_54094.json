So, i got this machine not turning on. there is green light on charger that goes orange, and it responds to a smc reset. i got the board out of the case, and i saw u6100 with corrosion in pin 8. i took it out, and remove c6100 and c6101. i try to reprogram u6100 but its shorted. then i take another u6100 put a proper rom, and put it in the board again. pin 8 of u6100 was blown out, so i run a wire to c6100 pin 1.alright, after this whenever i plug power, it powers once and shut down, i notice this because i conected a usb mouse and i see it lights up once. then i took measurements of sm_slp_s4_p and it was coming up and going down at once. ive already replaced U6101, U1900, and U1950 and still the same issue.\n\nin the forum it says that it wont turn on without battery, and the battery was screwed; so i put one from a 2013 machine that i had lying around. should i get one from a 2015 machine; or this one does just fine?\n\nand\nSo where do i go from this?."}
