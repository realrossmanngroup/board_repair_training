        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP.",
        "U6101": "What is U6101? a CHIP.",

        "C6101": "What is C6101? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "PM_DSW_PWRGD": "What is PM_DSW_PWRGD? The \"PM_DSW_PWRGD\" signal in a MacBook stands for \"Deep Sleep Well Power Good‚Äù and is required for the machine to power on & post..",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",

        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "PM_SLP_S0_L": "What is PM_SLP_S0_L? a SIGNAL.",

So, i got this machine not turning on. there is green light on charger that goes orange, and it responds to a smc reset. i got the board out of the case, and i saw <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> with corrosion in pin 8. i took it out, and remove <CAPACITOR>C6100</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C6101</CAPACITOR>. i try to reprogram <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> but its shorted. then i take another <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> put a proper rom, and put it in the board again. pin 8 of <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> was blown out, so i run a wire to <CAPACITOR>C6100</CAPACITOR> pin 1.alright, after this whenever i plug power, it powers once and shut down, i notice this because i conected a usb mouse and i see it lights up once. then i took measurements of <SIGNAL>SM_SLP_S4_P</SIGNAL> and it was coming up and going down at once. ive already replaced <CHIP>U6101</CHIP>, <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>, and <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> and still the same issue.\n\nin the forum it says that it wont turn on without battery, and the battery was screwed; so i put one from a 2013 machine that i had lying around. should i get one from a 2015 machine; or this one does just fine?\n\nand\nSo where do i go from this?."
