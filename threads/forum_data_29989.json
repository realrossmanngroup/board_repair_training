        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SMC_ONOFF": "What is SMC_ONOFF? SMC_ONOFF is a signal that tells the machine that the power button has been pressed so it knows to turn on, or turn off. .",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",
        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. ."

            "message": "I suspect this unit is the victim of a cheap Chinese charger, bad dorm room wiring, etc. Came in with no green light / no power. <RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR> was blown, replaced the resistor and ISL. Got green light back, however after a few seconds it cuts off, and then a few seconds letter will come back on. <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL>, Adapter Sense, PPBUS, 3V42, are all normal and they do not seem to fluctuate whether the green light is on or not. The computer will not turn on when the light is green or off. I replaced the <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> chip as the Manual SMC Reset rail was only 2.887v as the regular <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET</SIGNAL> was 3.4ish along with <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL>. Could this be an issue when the computer tries to change power states or is it more likely an SMC issue?"
