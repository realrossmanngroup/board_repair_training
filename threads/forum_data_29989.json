R7051 was blown, replaced the resistor and ISL. Got green light back, however after a few seconds it cuts off, and then a few seconds letter will come back on. SMC_BC_ACOK, Adapter Sense, PPBUS, 3V42, are all normal and they do not seem to fluctuate whether the green light is on or not. The computer will not turn on when the light is green or off. I replaced the SMC_RESET_L chip as the Manual SMC Reset rail was only 2.887v as the regular SMC_Reset was 3.4ish along with SMC_ONOFF. Could this be an issue when the computer tries to change power states or is it more likely an SMC issue?"}
