        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",

        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

When I reconnect the power, the MacBook boots as normal but the Firmware never gets updated.\n\n\nI tried with my updated serial bios and I also tried with a clean BIOS (3437clean.bin file) and made no changes to that file that duke had posted on the forum and both do the same thing.\n\nI went and check the resistors and they all seem to be within spec and the traces aren't broken. I tried a different BIOS chip as well, just in case it was messed up.\n\n\nRight now, my mind is stuck on the idea the BIOS information isn't programmed right or missing something. Does anyone have any ideas? Possible I am looking at this wrong and overlooking something dumb.\n\nThanks."

In my case, I used <SIGNAL>MBA61_0099_B20_LOCKED</SIGNAL>.scap and copied it to my Downloads on the MacBook.\n\nOpen a terminal window and run:\n\nYou need to install the firmware to SSD/Harddrive EFI partition:\n\nsudo bless -mount / -firmware ~/Downloads/<SIGNAL>MBA61_0099_B20_LOCKED</SIGNAL>.scap --recovery --setBoot --nextonly --verbose \n\nYou need to verify the firmware got copied over and you do this by:\n\ndiskutil mount /dev/disk0s1 ; ls -l /Volumes/EFI/EFI/APPLE/FIRMWARE/ ; diskutil unmount /dev/disk0s1\n\n\nIf you see the firmware file: <SIGNAL>MBA61_0099_B20_LOCKED</SIGNAL>.scap you should be good to reboot.\n\nType: sudo reboot and the MacBook should reboot and update. In my case, it would get stuck and never get past this.\n\n\nAnyhow, since I know 100% for certain it is the firmware updating causing it to get stuck in a loop, I checked all traces again and measured every resistor (may have been fruitless to do so but I figure what the hell, why not) and it all matched up.\n\nThe BIOS has lines to the JTAG, CPU, and SMC.\n\nJTAG has been removed already as it was destroyed before I got the board. I can't swap the CPU but, I can check the lines to the BIOS under the SMC.\n\nSo, I removed the SMC and checked the path to the BIOS and it was fine. Since I had the SMC off, I figure, just as well swap it out. I couldn't see anything else other than the CPU or the SMC causing the issue.\n\nBooted the system with a donor SMC and re-ran my manual firmware update and BOOM it worked. At this point, I am assuming the SMC was the reason the BIOS was corrupted in the first place.\n\n\n\nSources I used for Manual Firmware updates:\n[url]https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/did-yosemite-update-boot-firmware.1818849/page-2[/url]\n[url]https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/311947/how-to-update-latest-macbook-pro-efi-firmware-manually[/url]"
