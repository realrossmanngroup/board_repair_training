Also, <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> was covered as well.\n\nReplaced the caps and cleaned up the area and had to replace <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> as it was blown.\n\nBoard boots and works fine all expect the camera and for some reason when I try to get into the Apple diagnostics, it goes to the internet recovery then downloads and tries to boot but gets an EFI error Error: 0x8000000000000003, Cannot Load 'EFI/Drivers/TestSupport.efi' If I try with ASD software, an error flashes and then the unit starts booting from the hard disk.\n\nI am not sure if both items are linked or not. anyways, the camera doesn't get detected, I tried connecting the camera from another screen(just the camera connector) it did not detect it either.\nCamera connector j3502 \npins:\n1 = gnd\n2 = 9.8mv\n3 = 556mv\n4 = 3.4\n5 = 3.4\n6 = 5v\n\n\nat a loss on the camera not being seen.\n\nAny idea?"
