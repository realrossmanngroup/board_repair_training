        "message":"Hello,\n\nI have an 820-02016 that is stuck at 5v and cycling. My amp meter reads 5v with 0.1 amp before the amps drop to zero and my meter turns off completely before turning back on, repeating what I mentioned. The only history I have of the machine is that it stopped working after the trackpad was hit. The machine is otherwise in clean condition, there is zero liquid damage. The machine is also not able to enter dfu mode. \n\nPP3V8_AON_VDDMAIN - 3.8v\nPPBUS_AON -12.26v\nPPVDD_SOC_S1 - 0.663v\nPP1V8_S2 - 1.8v\nPP2V5_AWAKE_NAND - 2.5v\nPP1V25_S2 - 1.2v\nPP3v3_S2_UPC - 3.3v\nPP5v_S2 - 5v\nPP3v3_UPC0_LDO - 3.3v\nPP3v3_UPC1_LDO - 3.3v\nPP1v5_UPC0_LDO_CORE - 1.5v\nPP1v5_UPC1_LDO_CORE - 1.5v\n\nHere are some measurements I am able to check before it cycles off. \n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks again."
