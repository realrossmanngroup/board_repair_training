            "message": "Hello. I have a 2015 15\" MacBook Pro here that all of a sudden fails to chime or display an image following removal of the logic board and thermal re-grease. Its an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00426</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> Board. I tested this unit fully before disassembly and it ran perfect and passed all diagnostic tests. There is ZERO liquid damage on this board. It now turns on to only fans spinning at normal speed, no chime, and I can feel the CPU getting very warm. Could this be a case of a failed CPU? Its pulling 1AMP off the charger, and is still charging battery when battery connected. Where do I go from here?"
