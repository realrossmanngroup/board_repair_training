Customer brought it in because it would not turn on after it went black randomly while browsing.\n\nPlugged in charger and it was giving 20v @ 0 amps. I found a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. Fixed it by replacing <CHIP>U7430</CHIP>. No more short, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 13 volts, MacBook now turns on, makes charge connection sound, but no backlight (I can see faint Apple logo and it would boot / go to recovery assistant).\n\nThere is no sign of liquid.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 13 volts (12.3 - 12.5 volts if battery is connected)\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> = 55 volts"
