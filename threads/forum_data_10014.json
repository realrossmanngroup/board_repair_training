I do proper ultrasonic cleaning if you want to ask that with CREST and proper Branson solution and dry the board next go to alchohol and in oven for 10 min on 200 degrees celsius."}

That will melt all your repairs with normal solder! 120C is more than enough.\nNo idea what happened now, inspect for corrosion or damaged components.\n\nPlug in a USB mouse and see if it lights up, if not it is brain dead."}
