How ever <TRANSISTOR>Q8450</TRANSISTOR> pin 4 <SIGNAL>FET_EN_P12V_S0_R</SIGNAL> is 24v. I dont kno is this correct volatge .\n\nI have 2 logic boards same model same issue.\n\nAny help greatly appriciate ."

I'll try with good known bios, could this be bad CPU? I have 2 boards one with i5, and i7  6700k . I swap the CPU's still the same."
