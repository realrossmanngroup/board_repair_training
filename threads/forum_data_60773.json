On a good board, performing the same test, pin 4 remains at 47k. I've replaced <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR> (from <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> sch.) but still getting the same result. Would be safe to say the issue is with <CHIP>U7610</CHIP> and if so, can i pull it and jumper pins 1 and 4 to confirm this without damaging the board?"
