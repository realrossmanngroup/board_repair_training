    "definitions": {
        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "R7085": "What is R7085? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7080": "What is R7080? a RESISTOR.",
        "D6990": "What is D6990? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input, can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "CHGR_PHASE": "What is CHGR_PHASE? CHGR_PHASE is charger voltage chopped up into individual slices prior to smoothing where it becomes PPBUS_G3H.",

        "PPCHGR_DCIN_D": "What is PPCHGR_DCIN_D? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",

        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

So hopefully that means I am on the right track!\n\n<RESISTOR>R7080</RESISTOR> - 99.9k (good I think)\n<RESISTOR>R7081</RESISTOR> - 60.7 (good too)\n\n<RESISTOR>R7085</RESISTOR> - winner winner ? 0.577m Ohms\n<RESISTOR>R7086</RESISTOR> - 307K \n\n.......\n\n\nSo replace <RESISTOR>R7085</RESISTOR> which would fix <SIGNAL>CHGR_AGATE</SIGNAL> which makes <SIGNAL>CHGR_PHASE</SIGNAL> work?\n\nI shall await your response. \n\nCheers\n\nJames"
