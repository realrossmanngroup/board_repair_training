        "message":"HI, \nI got very little anywhere.\nI have replaced the DC in jack (820 - 2565) with a known good which seems to have helped a bit. \n\nI was working my way through power rails and related circuits (as I guess \/ assume they're related) so apologies if some of these are out of order or unnecessary. \n\n\nPPVIN _G3h_P3v42G3H (mesured at D6990) 18.09v\n3V42_G3H - 149.2 mv\nPPBUS_G3H 30.5mv\nPPCHGR_DCIN_D 18.5v\nCHGR_PHASE 10.5mv\n\nSo based on this I would conclude that there is something wrong with the circuit that is creating PPBUS_G3H\n\nAt this stage I believe I have power going INTO U7000 via PPCHGR_DCIN_D (@R7005). but not OUT of u7000.\n\nI see on pin 24 of U7000 there is CHGR UGATE but I am not sure if that functions as a enable or similar circuit. \n\nMy backtracking lead me to the schematic page which has R7080! So hopefully that means I am on the right track!\n\nR7080 - 99.9k (good I think)\nR7081 - 60.7 (good too)\n\nR7085 - winner winner ? 0.577m Ohms\nR7086 - 307K \n\n.......\n\n\nSo replace R7085 which would fix CHGR_AGATE which makes CHGR_Phase work?\n\nI shall await your response. \n\nCheers\n\nJames"
