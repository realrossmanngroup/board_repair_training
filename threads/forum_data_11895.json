        "message":"[PLAIN][SOLVED]820-2330 Macbook Pro 15\" Late 2008 - turn on when long press on button button.[\/PLAIN]\n\nHello and Merry Christmas to everyone :)\n\nwhen shorting the power pads, the fan will spin for 1 sec then stop. But when i shorting the power pads for 5sec+ then it can turn on fine.\nASD EFI and OS passed all tests. i replaced the c7771 even wasn't at fault.\n\nboard is not liquid damage. cant see any corrosion under microscope,\n\nR5710 is fine\n\nwhen i plug the keyboard flex back in, i am not able to perform SMC reset (Magsafe + Left Shift + Control + Option + Power )\n\nSMC_ONOFF_L measured at 3.4v and drop low to 0.3v when i press power.\n\ncharging the battery is fine. does same problem when i i use battery power only.\nMy 85w charger is REAL and i also have tried another 85w charger.\n\n\n#Edit, can a mod fix my thread title.\n\ncheers!\nAlan"
