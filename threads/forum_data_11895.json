But when i shorting the power pads for 5sec+ then it can turn on fine.\nASD EFI and OS passed all tests. i replaced the <CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR> even wasn't at fault.\n\nboard is not liquid damage. cant see any corrosion under microscope,\n\n<RESISTOR>R5710</RESISTOR> is fine\n\nwhen i plug the keyboard flex back in, i am not able to perform SMC reset (Magsafe + Left Shift + Control + Option + Power )\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> measured at 3.4v and drop low to 0.3v when i press power.\n\ncharging the battery is fine. does same problem when i i use battery power only.\nMy 85w charger is REAL and i also have tried another 85w charger.\n\n\n#Edit, can a mod fix my thread title.\n\ncheers!\nAlan"
