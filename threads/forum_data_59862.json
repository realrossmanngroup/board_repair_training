        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "SMC_LID_RIGHT": "What is SMC_LID_RIGHT? SMC_LID_RIGHT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the right LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_RIGHT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook won’t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",

            "message": "Repair attempt 1: \nRecently fixed this one after minor water damage. Replaced the RIO because of crackling sound. Tested it, everything seemed to work.\n\nRepair attempt 2: \nGot it back because it wouldn't wake up on occasion. Measure around for a bit and found <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_RIGHT</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>LID_OPEN_RIGHT</SIGNAL> to be .45V when the MB was open. This should be 1,5v on a normal board. Ended up tying <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> left and right together to ensure <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_RIGHT</SIGNAL> going to 1,5v when open. I have my doubts about this fix, but seemed to work at the time. \n\nRepair attempt 3:\nMacBook turned off suddenly according to the customer. When I got it, the charger showed 20v with amps jumping from 0 to .08 and back and the T2 chip felt a bit warm to the touch and of course no boot. After removing the aforementioned jumper and ultrasonic, now the board is stuck on 5v charging, again cycling between 0 and 0.08A. LDO's measure fine, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is present. With the jumper removed and just the bare board, <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_RIGHT</SIGNAL> and LEFT both are at 1,5v with nothing connected (as before)."
