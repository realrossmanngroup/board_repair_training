        "message":"Repair attempt 1: \nRecently fixed this one after minor water damage. Replaced the RIO because of crackling sound. Tested it, everything seemed to work.\n\nRepair attempt 2: \nGot it back because it wouldn't wake up on occasion. Measure around for a bit and found SMC_LID_RIGHT and LID_OPEN_RIGHT to be .45V when the MB was open. This should be 1,5v on a normal board. Ended up tying SMC_LID left and right together to ensure SMC_LID_RIGHT going to 1,5v when open. I have my doubts about this fix, but seemed to work at the time. \n\nRepair attempt 3:\nMacBook turned off suddenly according to the customer. When I got it, the charger showed 20v with amps jumping from 0 to .08 and back and the T2 chip felt a bit warm to the touch and of course no boot. After removing the aforementioned jumper and ultrasonic, now the board is stuck on 5v charging, again cycling between 0 and 0.08A. LDO's measure fine, PP3V3_G3H is present. With the jumper removed and just the bare board, SMC_LID_RIGHT and LEFT both are at 1,5v with nothing connected (as before)."
