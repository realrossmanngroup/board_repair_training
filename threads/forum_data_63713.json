            "message": "Need a little help, if you don't mind.\nThis board was liquid damaged, but very minorly: the audio board looks like it took a hit on it's audio amp chip.\nthe main board looks pretty good, with just some minor spots around <CHIP>U7290</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7291</TRANSISTOR>, replaced the whole area, controller, buck and affected resistors and caps around it.\nThere were no shorts on ppbus or any coils, so i decided to try and turn it on:\n\n20v, 0,089Amp draw,\nLooks like it makes it through the poweronsequence as far as <SIGNAL>SSD_PMU_RESET_L</SIGNAL>, and nothing after that (no SSD voltages at all)\nPPBUS is 12.6V by the way.\n\nI have tried to get it into DFU by jumpering <SIGNAL>FORCE_DFU</SIGNAL> pads to <SIGNAL>1V8_AWAKE</SIGNAL>, but the machine won't be revived, fails with some error about transitioning between DFU states.\nBy the way, whats weird is that i have to keep the jumper on FORCEDFU pads present, if i snap the wire, a couple of seconds after i see the machine pop up in AC2, it disappears...\n\nI have measured for shorts on the SSD rails, but found none.\n\nAny hints what to do next?\nThanks in advance!"
