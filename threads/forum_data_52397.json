I checked SMC_RESET_L and it is at 1.1v. does this mean the ISL6259 is bad? Thanks for any info!"}

Wouldn't you know it? the Freaking JTAG!!!!! Removed it and BAM! Green\/Orange light. Put U5110 back on and BAM!!! FAN SPIN!!!! I swear I looked at the J6100 and it didn't look bad at first glance, on the outside. but inside some of the pins were pinkish-red. Thank you so much! You Rock!"}
