    "definitions": {
        "820-3662": "What is 820-3662? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "U7750": "What is U7750? a CHIP.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR": "What is PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR? PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR is PPBUS_G3H after it has passed through a backlight fuse and a transistor that allows power through when BKLT_PLT_RST_L and LCD_BKLT_EN are present. .",
        "PPBUS_SW_BKL": "What is PPBUS_SW_BKL? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN": "What is LCDBKLT_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKLT_VDDA": "What is BKLT_VDDA? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKLT_VDDD": "What is BKLT_VDDD? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."
