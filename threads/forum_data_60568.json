A couple of keys are not working as well, I have ordered a new keyboard.\n\nWhere do I start when problem solving this issue? I have seen an issue similar posted in here but I can't seem to find that post again.\n\nThankyou, Karl"

The trackpad works and all the keys on the replacement keyboard work before logging into the macOS.\n\nAfter logging into macOS the trackpad stops working, Testing the keys on the keyboard once logged in and the keys 7,8,9,U,I,O,J,K,L,M, .  do not work.\n\nOne thing I noticed testing the keys is when I click into the search bar top right to test keys, the letter i doesn't register on the on screen keyboard as clicking however  it changes the window from the search bar at the top to a finder view and when |I press it again it reverts back to the search toolbar at the top of the screen.\n\nSo I guess my actual situation is logicboard issues not the trackpad or keyboard? Where to from here?\n\nThanks, K"
