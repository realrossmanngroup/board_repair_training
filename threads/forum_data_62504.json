            "message": "Hi there, got this good looking Macbook with the original fault: no power. Connected PSU and all 4 ports were drawing 450mA @5V, one of <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> had a burnt hole and the other one was significantly warm. Replaced all of them and now all ports behave the same: 5V @240mA (current is floating between 220mA and 280mA). When PSU is connected, there is 1/3 secs with 300mA, then it drops to 0.02A and then, it goes up to 240mA (floating). The only part which I can feel is slightly warm (just 2-3 degrees above my hand's temperature) is T2, no other sources of heat. No spillage signs anywhere.\n\nI cannot put it to DFU - tried multiple times on the working computer so I'm sure that the method I use works 100%. A bit strange issue is that when the 2nd working Macbook is connected to that faulty one and I try to connect the charger, I cannot get the machine to draw any current (Voltmeter stays completely blank). As soon as I disconnect the cable between Macbooks, the Voltmeter turns on (no need to re-connect charger). Is it normal?\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.6V and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> = 3.4V. How to troubleshoot it further? Many thanks in advance."
