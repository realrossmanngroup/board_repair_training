        "message":"Good morning, everyone.\n\nI received this MacBook for repair; it turns on but doesn't charge. The USB-C ports weren't working, and the AMP meter is cycling.\n\nAfter inspecting the logic board, I found that C5202 was blown, and PDCIN_AON_CHGR_R was shorted. I replaced the capacitor, and now it gets 20V and 1.8 amps on the USB-C ports.\n\nHowever, the problem is that when I disconnect the charger and connect it back again, it stops charging and goes to 20V 0.03 amps. The only way to make it work again is to disconnect the battery and connect it back.\n\nI tested it with another battery, and the issue remains the same. I replaced the U5200 (ISL9240HI), but it made no difference.\n\nCould someone please provide some guidance?\n\nThank you."
