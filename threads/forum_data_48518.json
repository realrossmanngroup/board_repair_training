The rest of the board is very clean including SMC area and clock area. Replaced the damaged components. I now have fan spin with 1.8V on <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> but no chime, no video. Light on usb mouse blinks once in a while, it's never solid. PPVRTC - 3.3V\n\nCorrosion?\nThanks!"

Thank you for your help!\n\nShould I replace the entire chip and firmware or just firmware you think?\n\nI do have a programmer but have yet to use it yet. Should I just youtube on how to use it and where would I find the correct firmware? Up until now I have just been buying pre programmed chips.\n\nThanks again! Have a great day.\n\n\n\nUpdate - \n\nFound a dump file for this board and reprogrammed the original chip. Computer turns on but is ridiculously slow. Its been sitting on the desk loading to OS for about 10 minutes now. I guess Im looking for another dump?"
