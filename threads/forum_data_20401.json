        "P5VS4RS3_EN": "What is P5VS4RS3_EN? PP5VS4RS3_EN is a signal that enables the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail. When you see _EN in front of a signal name, it means that it is enabling whatever comes before the _EN when the signal is high..",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "5V_S5": "What is 5V_S5? 5V_S5 is an abbreviation for “PP5V_S5” which is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 state. .",
        "S4_PWR_EN": "What is S4_PWR_EN? S4_PWR_EN turns on the S4 power rails. Signals ending in _EN enable whatever came before _EN in the signal name when the voltage of the signal is high. .",

CPU does not get warm.\n\nPPBUS, 3v42, vrtc, <SIGNAL>5V_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>3V_S5</SIGNAL> all stable and present. Where things get funky is with the higher-up voltages--<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>3V3_S3</SIGNAL>, vcore, and <SIGNAL>P5VS4RS3_EN</SIGNAL>--are all pulsing. They come up for a split second, then disappear. VCORE is present, but pulses along with the other voltages. I tracked back the pulsing, and <RESISTOR>R8177</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R8179</RESISTOR> are both pulsing on both pins (<SIGNAL>S4_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>). \n\nI checked for a short on the s5/s4/s3 rails and found none. No liquid to the board that I can find. Inspected very closely under the microscope.\n\nAny ideas where I should go next? All help appreciated!"

I posted last year about a \"growing stack\" of boards with similar issues...this one will join those. Would really love to get these figured out. They're all no-liquid boards, too; or at least, there's zero evidence of a spill. Oh well."

I wanted to quickly update; I decided to check all termination resistors in the BIOS area just because (last resort--hadn't done so yet), and found <SIGNAL>SPI_CS0_L</SIGNAL> was not continuous from one of the test pads to <RESISTOR>R6125</RESISTOR>. Ran a quick wire and we have fan spin! But now I'm dealing with an on/off/on/off/on/off issue. Will get back to work and update when needed."
