The issue was with the SMC being upside down. Thank you for answering my previous questions, greatly appreciated. The DC supply was attached when I did the continuity mode, so that explains it. thx!"

            "message": "HEY EVERYONE. I DECIDED TO CONTINUE THIS THREAD AND DECIDED TO FIX THE LAPTOP ANYWAY. (NEVER GIVE UP)\n\nI decide to not give up on the motherboard. Giving up its not the way to success and not the way to learn things. So I spent nearly 3 hours extra fixing the left Fan. I used the hot air gun to take away the broken plastic connector for the fan, it had melted earlier a bit so it did not function... I then jumped wires from under the fan cable directly on its voltage lines and then to the respective location, I added the green coating first on all the cables so they wouldn't short each other. I first didn't connect it to ground as well, so the fan didn't start first. I didn't connect ground, so I thought that might be an issue. Like powering up a computer by shorting it to ground, so I thought the fan might need this too. I redid everything, wires, soldering and this time with ground connected, I also changed the SMC one more time just in case. Now the fan is back on working again and computer power on --> 20v, 1.200amp, Wil now see if I get any display.\n\nA lesson for anyone reading this: Do not give up when it gets hard, re-think, take a breather, go out for a walk, come back with the attitude you can solve the problem and spend that extra time honing it on it. I also learned a couple of few new things from fixing this problem. So it was a blessing in disguise.\n\nI will revert back asap with voltages lines if I don't get any display. meantime I post two images of the fan connector with wires, should anyone of u guys run into the same problem."
