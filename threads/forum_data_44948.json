I think it had liquid damage initially but someone else has already messed with the board so i can't really tell\n\nIt has green light. Have started going down the power rail list. everything looks normal and i've stopped at the 5v rails because they are acting strange. Evertime I measure it's a different number. Sometimes it's 0, sometimes it's 2.5 and sometimes it's 5. I don't see it change when i'm holding the probes on it but when i release the probes and put them back on it's a different number again. \n\nThe thing I see that has definitely been messed with is \n<CHIP>U7501</CHIP> \n\nShall i keep going down the power rail list or am i on the right track?\n\nThanks!"
