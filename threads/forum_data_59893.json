Replaced and unit is booting but does not see serial number. SPI traces all good.\nI ordered and replaced the EFI chip which was meant to be pre programmed but still have the same issue. I have since bought a CH341A programmer and I have uploaded the original EFI dump to Google drive [URL='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ii4hBOdsSUTghy9l7isNIZVPlj2El7sT/view?usp=sharing']here[/URL] Is anyone able to help make it a working EFI so the customer can have serial number again or advise if it could be something else?\n\nSerial number:  C02NT0KBG085\nEarly 2014 MacBook Air <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>\n\nThanks!"
