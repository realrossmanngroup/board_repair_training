            "message": "I've ended up with a fairly large collection of non-US keyboards that I'm trying to keep from going in the garbage. They're either going to a recycling center where they'll end up as scrap or garbage, or if someone here wants them I'll send them to you, just send me a shipping label or money for shipping costs. 2009 up to 2015 - 7 Airs, 4 Retinas, 9 2009-12 Pros. Most of them should be working fine, we just can't sell computers with non-US keyboards so we had to pull them. Including a bunch of MagSafe extension cables and regular wall connectors. The box weighs 19 pounds so if you're outside of the US it will probably be fairly expensive but still might be worth it."
