The reason you're reading 0.1...3.8v is that you're reading output of the buck converter which is basically a sqare wave with a pulse width proportional to voltage. \nAs for random start behaviour, you need an oscilloscope to check all frequency generators. If you don't, you can still check them with a heat gun - usually defect crystal work better when heated to somewhere 100c. Don't do it too much, just check if it makes any difference."
