        "message":"Hi Guys \n\nI recently repaired a badly moisture damaged Mac book Pro 13\" (Early 2015 I believe)\nDetails:\nModel 1502\nEMC 2835\n\nI replaced the keyboard, SSD and main logic board.\n\nAfter I did this I re-installed the OS and updated to Mojave no problems everything is working great apart from the fact I realised I couldnt login to iMessages and Facetime.\nAfter a little research I think the issue is down to the fact that My new logic board has no serial number written to it as per the photograph that is attached of the About Mac dialog box.\n\nWhat would you guys recommend to help solve this issue? \n\nAny help would be gratefully received as this is the only thing left now for the machine to fully operational again. So close yet so far its so frustrating!\n\nThank you \n\nGabi :)\n\nPS Should you require any further information please just ask! :)"

As the bits needed would take a few weeks to come through anyway.\nIf I decided to go ahead and get the programmer and lead would you help me through it?\nThanks Gabi"
