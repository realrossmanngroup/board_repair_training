            "message": "So I have here this macbook pro 15\" <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1990</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> which produces this error codes in the diagnose mode. The fans are spinning high and the macbook is very slow. What I read about this error, that changing the touch pad will solve this. So I put this mainboard in an second functional macbook and the error is exactly the same. I have installed the TG Pro software and I'm missing the point \"palm rest\". It looks like there is a failure on the mainboard not on the externals. Any solution for this? Does it make sense to change the smc or is it possible to change this? I don't know maybe it is locked with a serial number or so. Thanks"

I changed the board 1:1 in other shell so battery, display touch pad and all other things were different. Today I have disconnected the display and conected to external monitor. Same issue. By the way what is ALS failure?"
