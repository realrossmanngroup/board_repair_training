No sign of life.\nThe voltage from the adapter is stuck at 5V.\n\nThe voltage <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_UPC</SIGNAL> on the USB-C Port Controller is missing, but the port doesn't have any short circuits nor does the board.\nI see it's coming from PMU: Master LDO (<CHIP>U8100</CHIP>).\n<SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON_MPMU_ISNS_VIN</SIGNAL> on it IS THERE, but <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_UPC</SIGNAL> is NOT THERE.\n\nAny idea what I can do? Is this the actual problem?"
