It was displaying 20V but not booting correctly. We found a small amount of liquid damage on the board near U9080 & U9000. Both were removed and replaced. No shorts on the board before & after. \n\nWe booted the board and had no display but found we had heat on the board at UA900. This GPU power chip was replaced with all voltages showing after.\n\nWe found that we have the system now booting but no display. We checked the voltages at the connector (with a screen connected) and have our 3.3V & 5V for display but no voltage for backlight. We\u2019ve plugged the machine into an external monitor and we do have a screen.\n\nAt the backlight driver (U8400), we have 5v input, and the other voltage inputs. We\u2019ve confirmed the fuse has correct values. But have found we are missing the EDP_BKLT_EN signal from the GMUX. We\u2019ve check to ensure it is not the driver pulling down the line or the resistor. \n\nTracing back to the GPU, we find that we are getting no EG_BKLT_EN into the GMUX. RA129 shows 0 at the GPU. We\u2019ve tested against a known good board and should have 3.3v here.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried to make this EDP_BKLT_EN signal by adding a wire and injecting voltage into the backlight driver but we still get no display and no output voltages from the driver (Sorry apart from BKLT_ISET_KEYB, which shows 1.2v. But no feedback voltages.\n\nWe are beyond the point of a economical repair, as it\u2019s taken us a long time of diagnosing to get to this stage (we\u2019re still new to MacBooks). But don\u2019t wish to give up on this one. Is there anything we may have missed that would help?"}
