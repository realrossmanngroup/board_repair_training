When you connect or disconnect the charger, it makes the charging sound and that sound triggers the computer to kernal panic and reboot. The issue ended up being a bad audio amplifer on the board. Once I found and replaced the IC, everything was fine. I would check for shorts or low diode values on the audio amplifiers."
