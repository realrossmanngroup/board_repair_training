        "message":"Hello,  I have a fun one.\n\nI have a 820-02020 that suffered a small surge due to water damage.   I have repaired most of the damage and came to the last part that died and it was the RF chip UL000.  I pulled that chip and I now have a booting logic board.  (without UL000) installed.\n\nQuestion is?   Can I just replace this chip or will I be in all kinds of trouble like changing one on a ipad?[ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"820-02020 UL000 upload.jpg\"]60247[\/ATTACH]"

So i removed UL000 and the board was booting. Then i changed the UL000 from a Donor. The board is still booting but the machine don't work with this chip. There is no WLAN and no Bluetooth present. I don't know - did i kill the chip or is there another reason that he don't want to work with it."
