But it doesn't boot.\nWhen I measure the power rails, I get only [B]0.8V[/B] on [B]<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU_REG</SIGNAL> ([/B]instead of 1.25V). I thought there could be an issue with <TRANSISTOR>Q7510</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR>, so I replaced them but nothing changed. Does someone have a clue?\n\nThanks a lot!!!"

By pressing the alt key, I was able run the ASD EFI Test which passed (after 1 hour - slowest part of the test were the memory tests).\nThe thing now is, that I can't install OSX because its so so slow. The mouse is lagging and everything takes way too long.\nWhen I check the sensor readings in the ASD EFI, I can't find a sensor which seems [B]not[/B] normal - everything looks fine.\nDoes anyone have an idea what could cause this?\n\nThank you!"
