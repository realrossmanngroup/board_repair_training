            "message": "Hi all!\n\nHave this board with a not working trackpad\n\nAfter inspecting the board i saw that L4800 is melted - no courant that goes to trackpad. It also damaged the tracks under it as well as it have damaged 4830 but not sure if the damage is purely cosmetic or if i will have to find this one some where. \n\nMy question is: is L4800 mandatory or it can be bypassed? Any idea what could cause that? The board look clean and the trackpad as well, but i see that some one already played with the screws of track pad... not sure if the one installed is the original or a replacement.\n\n\nThank you!!"
