No visible liquid damage under the scope on either boards. Customer A had the SSD replaced in May 2019 (Old SSD Died) and is having this issue, Customer B purchased their MBA Feb 2019 and never had any issues until this past week.\n\nSo far for Customer B I replaced I/O Board and I/O Flex, swapped in a known good SSD and fresh install of 10.14.5 but they are still having the same issue. Could this be SMC or something else? Nothing is coming up in the system console for errors. I'm perplexed."
