I searched the forum and couldnt find any thread regarding this issue. Ive tried countless reinstalls of mojave, big sur and monterey, tried the safe boot workaround, no avail. wondering if its hardware, software or just plain bad luck. ive tried internet recovery, /createmediainstall from usb.  thanks in advance.\n\napple thread regarding the issue, but no solution: [URL]https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/107755[/URL]"
