        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",

        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",

Other problem was that a lot of times the computer didn´t start.\n\nI did remove the board to inspection and add corrosion on <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>, i did clean and replace <RESISTOR>R6116</RESISTOR> because wasn´t good but problem persist. Then with further testing i replace <RESISTOR>R7006</RESISTOR> because wasn´t good after that the problem off only power sometimes was solved.\n\nBut i still had the slow and crash problem, after that just for testing i did replace de <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> from a donor. I was kinda happy because the after that the laptop was slow but didn´t crash anymore. But then i saw another problem every time i insert the login password the progress bar was really slow and never pass from there.\n\nOnce again i inspect the board and i miss corrosion in other point of the board this time <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>, i replace the ic from donor board and after that the board start once or twice and now is dead.\n\n\nNow i will post some values for someone can help have a light of what i have here:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 8.58V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.41V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> 3.32v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 3.32v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> 0v\n\n<CHIP>U5110</CHIP>\n1_ 3.41V\n2_ 0V\n3_ 3.41V\n4_ 2.76V\n5_ 3.38V\n6_ 3.34V\n7_ 3.41V\n8_ 3.29V\n\nI did trigger <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> drop from 3.41V to 0.35V\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL> 3.4V\n<SIGNAL>PCH_DSWVRMEN</SIGNAL> 3.22V\n<SIGNAL>PM_DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL> 3.41V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER_EN</SIGNAL> 3.41V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.32V\n<SIGNAL>RTC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> 3.32v\n<SIGNAL>PCH_SRTCRST_L</SIGNAL> 3.32v\n<SIGNAL>PCH_INTVRMEN_L</SIGNAL> 3.22v\n<SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL> 3.29v\n\nI did try SMC bypass and the board start with the fan at high rpm and don´t have any light in the charge is that normal?
