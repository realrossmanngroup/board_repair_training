        "message":"Hi,\n\nThis is a clean board.\n\nHow ever P!V5_GPU_S0 was not there. after replacing Q8360 and Q8361 I got 1.35v on this rail and it turned on.\n\nIt was working fine with out having any issue but start crashing with audio editing and now half way stuck on apple logo. \nBefore it crashed I check ASD OS test and it all passed couple of times. However Internal graphic test graphic were bit scattered.\nYOu cant feel much heating on GPU rams or GPU as 2011 boards. As soon it turn on P!V5_GPU_S0 is 1.5v then after chime goes to 1.35v.\n\n\n\nAny clue?"

I can replace GPU on this but GPU seems to be good. P1V5_GPU_S0 is 1.35 as schemetics but saw on Louis videos it should be 1.5v?"
