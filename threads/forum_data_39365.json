Does this run off of a battery or does the charger have to be plugged in?[/QUOTE]\n\ntried another battery and still same problem. with battery connected no any light on charger and without battery booting mac and there is orange light as well. but if you read my earlier post is start booting and light after <SIGNAL>PPBUS_3GH</SIGNAL> is under 1 volts and than without battery <SIGNAL>PPBUS_3GH</SIGNAL> (when booted) is 8.58v and with battery no any light and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 6.92v. corrosion was on the half of the motherboard."
