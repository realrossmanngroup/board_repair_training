        "message":"hi everyone, this is my first post and first macbook repair try. normally i am doing iphone repairs. so i tried to start doing repair with your help. thanks in advance for everyone.\n\nso i have in hand A1466 820-3437-b it was water damaged. first i detected that there was backlight problem and i changed backlight ic and now backlight working without any problem. but have another problem.when i am plugging charger without battery connected macbook turning on and working but with battery connected not turning on and doesn't have any light on charger,\n\np.s  i also detected that even without battery also not turning on always but most of times its turning on* ( in 10 tries about 8 times is turning on 2 times not). and also a bit strange is that  without battery when i am plugging charger no any sense and no any light about 1 minute and after that green than orange  light comes up and mac is turning on. \n\n i have changed u7100, u7501 and u8080. also tried another battery. nothing  changed. thanks in advance again"
