BIL area looks fine, as does area for <RESISTOR>R5071</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R6961</RESISTOR>. Both resistors measure fine. SMC area looks fine, but this board actually had a pretty major burn near <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR>, which I repaired, so I wonder if the surge that caused that damage also zapped the SMC. Board powers up and works fine, but the front sleep light stays on and backlight stays off.\n\nWould the next course of action be to replace the SMC? I don't see anything that would affect <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>. Diode mode on <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is .687, so doesn't appear shorted or anything, just low. \n\nThanks!"

Checked everything there, nothing close to BIL or anywhere near <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>, of course. No damage or burning near firewire. <RESISTOR>R5071</RESISTOR> measures fine (100k); I have ~1.5v at <RESISTOR>R5071</RESISTOR> pin 1 (<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>) and 3.42v on pin 2 (pp3v42). Replaced <RESISTOR>R5071</RESISTOR> to be sure, and same issues. This is looking more and more like an SMC issue, yes? With 3v42 on pin 2 to pull up <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>, and it still only at ~1.5v, then that would mean the SMC isn't spitting it out properly, I'd assume?"

Not sure what the issue is, but I'm getting close to calling it an internal partial shorting of <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>.\n\nI did have one more piece of information that may be relevant; the measurement for <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> bounces around quite a lot; from 1.27v to 1.39v, as high as 1.5v, back down to 1.10v, then back up; never reaches more than right around 1.5v and never drops lower than ~1.17v. I didn't realize how unsteady it was until watching it for a few seconds. \n\nGoing to toss this one into the parts pile unless there's some work-around."
