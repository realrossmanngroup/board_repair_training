Green and orange charger light is present. \nI found one issue main board was shorted on <TRANSISTOR>Q7320</TRANSISTOR>, liquid damage was in <CHIP>U7310</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> area now this part looks ok,\nI have 12v on <CAPACITOR>C7619</CAPACITOR>, P1v05 is present.\nI fixed also <TRANSISTOR>Q8180</TRANSISTOR> it was liquid damaged too few resistors was missing this is fixed too. \n\nI don't have <SIGNAL>P3V3S0_EN</SIGNAL> any idea where or what I should check next ? \n\nThanks"
