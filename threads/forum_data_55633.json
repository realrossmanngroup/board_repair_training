        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",

Overall board visually looks in very good shape.\n\nBoard gives a green and then orange light on the charger, but no fan spin.\n\nI have checked the power rails, and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is present at 12.58V\nAll S5 power rails are present and with good voltage\nNothing on S4 power rails.\n\nLooking at the power switching circuits, the Enable signals for <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> are low.\nAccording to the schematic, they are driven by the PCH.\n\nNot quite sure where to look at from that point. I've seen people suggesting to look at RTC and SPI flash.\nI have a good 32Khz signal on <SIGNAL>PCH_CLK32K_RTCX1</SIGNAL>.\n\nI also looked at the <SIGNAL>SPI_CLK</SIGNAL> signal, and I can see pulses there when I apply power to the board, then a steady 3.3V\nOne thing I don't quite understand is who is driving this clock. Because on the schematic, there's two SPI masters on the bus - SMC and PCH, which seems weird to me.\n\nSo, this is where I am at. Hopefully the PCH is not dead. Any idea where to look at next ? Is it worth it dumping and/or reflashing the ROM ?\n\nThanks in advance!"

I still don't get the <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL> signals from those two logic gates.\nI saw a video where Louis \"sodomized\" a board of the same type, and where he removed <CHIP>U8005</CHIP> and put jumper wires directly between <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and those two signals. I tried that too. The board doesn't boot.\nAs a last attempt, I removed the ROM flash in order to reprogram it with a clean ME dump. It appears that the fan spins while the ROM is off the board, but well, without a firmware, it doesn't mean it actually boots.\nAfter I solder the ROM back on the board, after reflash, the board still doesn't start. It draws 20mA from the power supply, and every 5 seconds or so, spikes to around 160mA for a very short time and goes back down. So it tries to boot, but fails.\nIs this time for me to call this a donor board ?"
