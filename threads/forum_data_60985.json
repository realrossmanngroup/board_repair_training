            "message": "Hello,\n\ncurrently I'm working on a water damaged <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. There was corrosion on and around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> with a broken pad No 25. After trying to restore the pad i scratched too much and opened the underlying layer (GND). PP7103 is not shorted to ground but pin 25 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> is now... Any ideas how the fix this the best way? Is it possible to short <SIGNAL>CPUGT_PWM1</SIGNAL> to <SIGNAL>CPUGT_PWM2</SIGNAL>?\nThe rest of the board seems to be good. I get <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGOOD</SIGNAL> and all other rails.\n\nThank you and best regards\nDudiPupan"
