        "message":"Hello. Got this board here. It was liquid damaged 2 times about a year ago. I ultrasonic cleaned it and it worked again until about 3 months ago when keyboard died. I ordered an used original top case and installed and machine worked again for 2 months. Yesterday it came back here with this critical software update issue. I thought it might be the Touch Bar from the new top case that died and as I had a similar machine here from another costumer I decided to swap the boards and test. Same issue on another top case, so the problem is with the board. I tried several things from installing fresh updated OS on external drive to ultrasonic clean the board again but no luck. The system boots normally on safe boot, but obviously no Touch Bar as its drivers won't load on safe boot. Any way to get rid from this error?"
