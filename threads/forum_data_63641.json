        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

The power button works.\n\nWatched Louis' video, tested if holding Option key was helping but no change.\n\nStarted from the trackpad connector and found out that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> was reading 2.1V.\nTraced it to <CAPACITOR>C2952</CAPACITOR> which was looking off, and replaced it. No change.\nFound corrosion at <TRANSISTOR>Q2945</TRANSISTOR>, and replaced it. No change.\nI went to every circuit that uses <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> as input and checked capacitors / resistors to find a short to ground or an abnormal value but nothing obvious.\n\nThen I moved on to <CHIP>U8000</CHIP> where <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> is created from <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is 3.3 V but <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4_FET_R</SIGNAL> is 2.1V\n\nSo I am suspecting whether <CHIP>U8000</CHIP> is not delivering the right voltage but I wanted to check before I blindly go ahead and change it. The chip looks healthy."
