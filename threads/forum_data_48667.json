        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U0500": "What is U0500? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",

        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

I left the board alone for 2 days while I worked on other repairs, and by the time I got to the board, I first plugged in magsafe and got a orange light. Light disappeared after a few seconds. I then removed magsafe and battery and held power button down for 10 seconds, reconnected power and got orange light and was able to boot machine to login screen. I decided to leave machine alone to charge up battery and noticed mage safe disappeared after a few minutes.\n\nNow device has orange light, and no boot. First thing I checked was <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> and noticed it was not present.\n\nPP3v42= 3.42v\nPPBUS = 12.6v\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3</SIGNAL>= 3.V\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5</SIGNAL>= 12\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 5V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> = 0\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>= 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL>= 0\n\nIt appears my <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> is not present so S4, S3, S0 rails are not present. Checked up the line and found <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> is created by <CHIP>U0500</CHIP>, so I looked into <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> and noticed it wasn't present either. I then noticed that <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> is created by the <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> Logic Gate, which is enabled once <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is present.\n\nI feel like I just went in a giant circle and was hoping for any advice on what I should be looking at next.\n\nThank you in advance."
