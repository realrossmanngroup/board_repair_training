        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

Sometimes it power on with apple logo and it is booting with full fan speed and very slow. Sometimes it is drawing current about 600-700mA fan full speed and nothing happens no screen. Tried to make diagnose but it hangs in the last minute. When it not turns on I leave it over night, then I can turn on 2-3 times. Also not possible turn on with battery. Sometimes when turn on a questionmark appears for 1-2 second and the it is booting. So maybe something wrong with ssd. I checked \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H_SSD0</SIGNAL> = 12,6V \n<SIGNAL>PP2V7_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> = 2,55V \n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_SSD0</SIGNAL> = 1,8V \n<SIGNAL>PP0V9_SSD0</SIGNAL> = 0,9V"

Today I got it one time to boot up to login screen of course with fan full speed and very slow everything. So far with this problem I was always able to boot up and check with software which sensor is bad. Without booting this will be hard"
