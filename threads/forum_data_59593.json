        "message":"Hi,\nWhen running ASD 3S146 OS on 820-3023 boards, it freezes on the first RAM test \"Apple 64 Memory Address As Data test\".\n3 different boards do the same, so I'm wondering if it's an issue with ASD itself or something I overlooked.\nIf I skip that test, it freezes on the next RAM test. If I skip them all it completes.\nOn one board I ran Memtest and it passed the 4 passes. ASD 3S146 EFI passes as well, and macOS 10.13 boots, appears to be working fine but haven't tested extensively yet.\nASD downloaded from the usual Russian torrent.\n\nAnyone encountered this issue on ASD OS already?"
