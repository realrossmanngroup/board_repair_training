        "message":"Could be anything. Probably something else still corroded and has nothing to do with the U7000 replacement. As you have a Vcore of 1.15V it means all power is ok and the CPU is just not starting. It could be anything. Go back and check all the corroded areas, crap under the SMC is common."
