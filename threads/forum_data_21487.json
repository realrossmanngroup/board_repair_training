        "820-3023": "What is 820-3023? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U9701": "What is U9701? a CHIP.",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BLK_EN": "What is BLK_EN? This is a typo of BKL_EN When you see BLK_EN, assume they meant to type BKL_EN.",

        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."

On plugging in the charger i get 50V on the backlight driver, but this drops down to ~20V after a split second. Without a screen plugged in i get 0 volts on the drive line. I've tried with a known good lcd. Am i just bad at soldering, or could there be something else going on?"

Resistance on this measures in the high Mohms. I replaced the resistor, and also <CHIP>U9701</CHIP>, just in case. Resistances seem back to normal, but after i turn on the machine, with a screen connected, <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> does not reach <CHIP>U9701</CHIP>. after disconnect it turns out the resistor is burned out again.\n\nAlso <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> measures 0.45 V at <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> with a screen connected.\n\nIt seems to me there could be trace damage under the <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> area that is causing this, but i'm a little at a loss since i've never seen this before. Is there something i can still try?\n\nedit: how do i see if the connector is burned up?"
