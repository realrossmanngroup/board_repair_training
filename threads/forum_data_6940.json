I replaced U7400 and everything was good for another day or so. It is now intermittently losing CPU Vcore now. When it goes out I'm still able to measure all voltages going into U7400. TONA and TONB resistors are measuring fine and voltage measures good through them. 5V_S0 is good as is CPUIMVP_VR_ON at 3.3V. Has anyone experienced this? Vcore issues usually seem to come together pretty cleanly but this one is getting me."}
