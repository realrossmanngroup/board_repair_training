            "message": "I have a liquid-damaged board that I've done a ridiculous amount of repairs to - shorted layers, shorted DC-In line, etc. It was working fine and then lost CPU Vcore. I replaced <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> and everything was good for another day or so. It is now intermittently losing CPU Vcore now. When it goes out I'm still able to measure all voltages going into <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>. TONA and TONB resistors are measuring fine and voltage measures good through them. <SIGNAL>5V_S0</SIGNAL> is good as is <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_VR_ON</SIGNAL> at 3.3V. Has anyone experienced this? Vcore issues usually seem to come together pretty cleanly but this one is getting me."
