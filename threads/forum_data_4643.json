        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",

        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "CPUIMVP_VR_ON": "What is CPUIMVP_VR_ON? CPUIMVP_VR_ON is a signal that tells the buck converter responsible for PPVCORE_S0_CPU to turn on and create CPU vcore voltage. This comes from ALL_SYS_PWRGD – once ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present, CPUIMVP_VR_ON will be present. .",

I've repaired main power circuit, replaced BIOS just in case. Everything about this board seems in order other than that one voltage (and the voltages that would come after it - CPU etc.) I haven't seen this one before. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I've attached pictures. They get shrunk pretty bad by the forum uploader but it might help a little."
