Everything is present on this board except PPVTT_S0_DDR_LDO. DDRVTT_EN (MEMVTT_EN) is not present. I've repaired main power circuit, replaced BIOS just in case. Everything about this board seems in order other than that one voltage (and the voltages that would come after it - CPU etc.) I haven't seen this one before. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I've attached pictures. They get shrunk pretty bad by the forum uploader but it might help a little."}

I thought I would need ALL_SYS_PWRGD in order to get CPUIMVP_VR_ON to enable U7400. Is that not true, is this just a CPU Vcore issue? I have 0.50V on CPUIMVP_VR_ON."}

U7300 is excluded from that, so some other voltage must be missing."}
