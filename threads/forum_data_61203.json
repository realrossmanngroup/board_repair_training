        "820-3435": "What is 820-3435? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL? This is the voltage coming directly from the charger after going through a transistor. .",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "D7012": "What is D7012? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year model macbook airs, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. ."

I was using my bench power supply with a modified cord for power.\n\nWhen I use a regular charger it is dead.  Nothing comes on.  No green light, No fan spin.  I know my bench power supply sends power regardless of one wire but I get the green light with this supply and the machine turns on so I know the charger is talking to the SMC.\n\nI replaced the SMC no help\nI replaced the DC-IN and ribbon no help.\n\nWhen I use a stock charger no \"one wire activity\" and the charger never turns on the machine.\nLooking at the \"One Wire\" signal line I never see data with the scope."
