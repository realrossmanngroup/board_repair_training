        "message":"Customer says it just won't turn on.  I tried another battery, and then another whole top case with new battery already installed.  No change.  5v negotiates to 20v after about 10 seconds, .468A drops to .0178A after 20v reached. Dual mosfet gates never told to open by U7000\n\nInspection, pretty thoroughly, no obvious damage, no obvious holes in resistors, clean overall.\n\nRails i've tested:\n\nPPBUS_G3H :  [B].77v[\/B] (no shorts to CPU\/GPU inductors, no shorts to any major inductors)\nPP3V3_G3H: 3.4\nPPVCCIO_S0 [I]and[\/I] PPVCC_S0_CPU : 0v (obv but just to show no short and cpu stays cold)\nPP3v3_S5: [B]0[\/B]\nPP3v3_S5_T139: 0\nPP5V_S5: [B]1.05v[\/B]\nPP3V3_SUS: .163v\nPP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC: 1.2v\nPP1V_S5_PCH_DCPDSW: [B]0[\/B]\nSMC_RST_L: 3.4v\nHPWR_EN_L: 3.37v\nTBA_VDDA: 5v\nTBA_VDDP: 5v\nPPDCIN_G3H: 20v\nPPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_R: .769v\nPM_EN_P3V3_G3H: 5v\nSMC_BC_AC_OK: 3.4v\n\n\nReplaced U7000 with one from store dot rossmanngroup dot com as I'm used to doing automatically, no change. Did a bunch of diode measurements using a working 00281 (so far only around u7000, gonna do the rest of page 64 later).  The only differences are small, one is to pp3v3_g3h which measured at 3.4v while plugged in, another difference was on TBA_BOOT1_RC, it measured lower drop in diode mode unplugged.  Checked basically every resistor around U7000, only found the 750K slightly out of spec, replaced, no change.  \n\nI've yet to compare resistances\/diode to ground on inductors, or remove fuses and test.\n\n25k PCH Clock present.  That's all the things I know to check on these fucking boards.  I could use some help, thanks."
