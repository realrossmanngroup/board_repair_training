I don't have a donor board and can't seem to find any online anywhere. But I need the connector for connecting the Touch Bar display to MLB. Anybody know where to find either a donor board or the connector itself ?? Preferably a donor so I could beep my way to where to bridge the burned pins as I also cannot find schematics for this shit...\n\nThanks"}
