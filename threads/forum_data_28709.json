If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

            "message": "Hey Duke. This board at first was only half chiming when I got it. Nothing plugged in except speaker. Minor liquid damage around clock. First thing I did was reoaired a trace leading to Y2805 and replaced the clock chip itself. After that I got full a chime for 1 or 2 boots then it went dead. Now the fucking thing is missing S3's and everything else down the line. And of course with my luck <SIGNAL>PM_SLP</SIGNAL> is missing!!! I'm getting kind of tired of being defeated by this type of issue. LOL. :) Do you think that because reworking the clock area got me a full chime a couple times that this being dead now is most likely related to clock/bios as well? What do you think I should do? Besides sell my equipment on Ebay.\n\nThanks man. Have a good one."
