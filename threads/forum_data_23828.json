        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",

If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3.

It's running silently when laptop isn't  stressed, loudly when it is.\n\nSeeing that I've replaced the SMC on this board, and that one of the inputs of <TRANSISTOR>Q6060</TRANSISTOR>  (which looks fine) comes from the SMC (<SIGNAL>SMC_FAN_0_CTL</SIGNAL>).. I think I know what the likely culprit is going to be, but I'd really hate pulling an SMC off an otherwise (finally) fully functional board at the risk of making it worse than it is now. Anything else I might do before messing with the SMC again? I've half a mind to run the thing through some serious stress testing to see whether an issue crops up."
