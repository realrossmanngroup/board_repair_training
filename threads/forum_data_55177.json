        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

            "message": "I got this previous liquid damaged machine back after 6 months of normal usage. The machine runs slow at boot and after logon as an effect of a sensor failure perhaps. The camera seems to work, the only strange thing I noticed in the beginning were some spikes on video using photo boot. I also checked with the oscilloscope the signal directed to the camera line smc and i2c bus and also the power line which has no spikes at all. I couldn't find a replacement camera in stock just to give a try but I'm afraid the problem arise somewhere else. Anybody has an hint to share wit me in order to find the right spot to look at?\nPs. what also sounds strange is that fan spins normallyin every conditions. No matter if other periferrals are disconnected, the fan spins normally and never boost up. Maybe some older issue with smc I had to replace after the previous liquid damage?"
