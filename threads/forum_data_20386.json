        "message":"Hi, I have a A1502 with 3476 (8GB) board that has has had liquid damage. Its been cleaned and now works apart from the right USB (I\/O board) is being disabled due to too much draw. The left usb works fine, even when the right it disabled. \nKeyboard and trackpad work fine. Trackpad had some liquid damage on one of the ribbons initially but that was cleaned off and it sorted the crazy cursor issue.\n\nI've tried with keyboard and trackpad ribbons not connected and its the same. \n\nI've tried another I\/O board and ribbon connector with the same result.\n\nIf you plug in a mouse, you get a light but nothing more.\n\nI've seen it once work fine for about 10 seconds after initial boot up, but then it was disabled by the OS\nAny ideas as to what I should check would be really appreciated."
