            "message": "Hello,\n\nI have a MacBook Air here that powers on just fine. I am able to hold D or start Internet recovery, but as soon as I connect to Wi-Fi, after 5-10 seconds of it starting, the computer restarts. The main operating system also loads to the Apple logo, stays there for 20-30 seconds and then restarts again. Customer mentioned about opening it before to change the battery. I tried new battery and still responding the same. I'd also like to add that if I hold D, it will stay in the Choose Network page indefinitely without randomly restarting. Fan spin is low / moderate.\n\nHow should I continue to troubleshoot this MacBook? Thanks!"
