LVDS connector looks a little bend inside and i have seen this causing no image before if its not making good contact. Right noe i have no 40 pin connectors in stock or on donors so ill need to wait until they arrive. I come back to this if i changed the connector."

So i want to be sure that the connection is working. Screen dosen't do anything. No Light, no image. So i assumed its not properly detected (have seen this before)... Also if i wait long enought voice over starts talking to me so i am sure its completely booted into my install USB."
