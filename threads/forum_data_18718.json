        "message":"Hello,\ni am working on a 820-2879 that is not turning on. I fixed the green light (isl6259. was burned) and now Q7085 won\u00b4t open. In fact it opens for 2-3 seconds (than ppbus_g3h is there and 16V can pass q7085 because the Gate is 6.6V) but than the Voltage on the gate jumps to 15.5V and Q7085 closes. I checked R7085 (0,471MOhm), R7086 (331KOhm), R7020 (5,4Ohm), R7021 (15,5Ohm) and R7022 (15,3Ohm). This should be fine i assume. Now i don\u00b4t know what to check next.\nThanks for any help"

Pins 16, 17 and 18 of u7000 were burned and i need to run jumpers there. As far as i can tell my soldering should be ok because i can not move the jumpers on both sides. So i assume they should be soldered on to the chip. Can this cause the problem?"

        "message":"I just saw i that i forget to mention that the problem was caused by water damage originally. Sorry for that. Voltage on C7005 is 16,25V and after a few seconds it goes up to 16,53V. I guess that is ok. I thought that Q7085 should be ok as it is able to switch on and off depending on the gate voltage. But to be sure i exchanged it but still the same behaviour with 15V on the gate. I measured around and also plugged in the battery. With only battery Q7085 has 9-10V on all pins (my battery could be a bit low) Also ppbus_g3h is 11V wiht only battery. If i plug charger and Battery in Q7085 has 6,6V on gate and lets the 16V pass. Also ppbus _g3h is 12,6V if both is plugged in. Is that normal on an older board like this? But if i short pads of R5015 with both plugged in it still wont turn on."
