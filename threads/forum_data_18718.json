When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution.

I fixed the green light (<CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>. was burned) and now <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> won´t open. In fact it opens for 2-3 seconds (than <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is there and 16V can pass <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> because the Gate is 6.6V) but than the Voltage on the gate jumps to 15.5V and <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> closes. I checked <RESISTOR>R7085</RESISTOR> (0,471MOhm), <RESISTOR>R7086</RESISTOR> (331KOhm), <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> (5,4Ohm), <RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR> (15,5Ohm) and <RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR> (15,3Ohm). This should be fine i assume. Now i don´t know what to check next.\nThanks for any help"

Voltage on <CAPACITOR>C7005</CAPACITOR> is 16,25V and after a few seconds it goes up to 16,53V. I guess that is ok. I thought that <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> should be ok as it is able to switch on and off depending on the gate voltage. But to be sure i exchanged it but still the same behaviour with 15V on the gate. I measured around and also plugged in the battery. With only battery <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> has 9-10V on all pins (my battery could be a bit low) Also <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 11V wiht only battery. If i plug charger and Battery in <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> has 6,6V on gate and lets the 16V pass. Also ppbus _g3h is 12,6V if both is plugged in. Is that normal on an older board like this? But if i short pads of <RESISTOR>R5015</RESISTOR> with both plugged in it still wont turn on."
