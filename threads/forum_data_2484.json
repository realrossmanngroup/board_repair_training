It would only run from battery and after some testing with the charger connected it went kinda FUBAR. I replaced <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> and noticed that <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> was getting really hot and green light was gone soon after that (also replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>). Now having tested most of resistors and various points for shorts I removed F7040 and injected 12V on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> pin. If I now connect the charger the fan starts - its also quite funny to watch the system staying on when the charger is afterwards removed (video).\n\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXYScevrZHU&feature=youtu.be[/url]\n\nIt seems the problem lies before the fuse but can't really focus on something.\n\nHope I am not wasting your time.\n\nGeorge"
