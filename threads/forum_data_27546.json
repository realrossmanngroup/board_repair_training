        "message":"Hi there,\n\nStrictly speaking this isn't a logic board question, so I apologise if it's off topic.\n\nI have an 820-3209 with an LCD that's getting occasional lines and distortions. I've established that it's not the logic board and not the cable, which leaves the LCD.\n\nI'm just curious if anyone has had any success with component replacements on the little LCD controller board? I assume that the problems I'm encountering are related to an issue on that controller. I have another cracked LCD for this computer in my spares pile, so I have a complete and functional controller board.\n\nHas anyone tried an LCD controller repair before?\n\nThanks in advance,\nBruce"
