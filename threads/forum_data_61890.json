        "message":"Have a bad feeling with with this MacBook Air. I have replaced both U7200 and r7200 and no luck. I'm weirdly getting 8.59 on ppbus. I know that this line is sensitive so im going to guess that even that is too high . \n\nAlso I had to run a Jumper on pin 17.... Pin 16 looked toasty as well. Looks like there was a short between them which would mean PPBUS went directly into a 5V CPU line..."

Both sides are 8.59V on that. \non r7201 it's 0v on both sides \npin 1 is 0V\nPin 16 0v \npin 17 8.59v of course \n\nalso checked R1951 just in case. 0V both sides. \n\nchecked all big coils on top. everything is 0V except for L7560 and of course L7130 is 8.59V\n\nI forgot to mention but you probably know anyway.
