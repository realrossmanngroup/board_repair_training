I'll try to remember the rules going forward.\n\nI did some searching and found this capacitor ([URL='https:\/\/www.mouser.com\/ProductDetail\/Kyocera-AVX\/CM105X5R106M25AT?qs=sGAEpiMZZMsh%252B1woXyUXj8lWL9%252Bq1p6jesBpCajBhKo%3D']CM105X5R106M25AT[\/URL]), would this possibly work? I'm very new to reading schematics and data sheets but it seems like it matches up with the specs you had listed."}
