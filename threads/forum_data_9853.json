The magsafe board needed to be replaced but I can not fit the new one into the port where it can charge properly.\n\nDoes anyone know a good way I can try to bend the aluminum frame so the magsafe can fit properly without badly damaging the frame?\n\nHere are some images: [url]https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/sh\/ponngv33heu5h0d\/AACs7QXyEYSI_Fb1DY-XiMjoa?dl=0[\/url]"
