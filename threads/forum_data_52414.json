        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",

        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",

            "message": "So this is probably one of the strangest repairs...I get a green/orange light on the charger and when I measure PP3V42 on pin 2 of L7095 and I get a steady 3.43v. But when I measure <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> I get 8.56v but then it dips every second down to 7.95, then back up to 8.56, then back down. It draws about 30mA then goes up to 100 mA, then back down. Anyone have experience with this type of issue? Thanks in advance!!!"
