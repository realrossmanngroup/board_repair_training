        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

All pins must measure something at least. I have no scrap 00165 to compare here right now to be 100% sure. Just order a pile of scrap boards, you will need them anyway."

I've used up all of my <CHIP>U6101</CHIP> chips from donor boards. That chip is only on 2015 Air and Retina boards so they went fast which is why I bought a large quantity of new ones. Just wasn't sure of the orientation but I have it now (opposite of my pic.)\n\n​So, the results: No change after installing newly purchased <CHIP>U6101</CHIP>. And no change after installing known-good ROM and factory <CHIP>U6101</CHIP> from other 00165 board. It still gets 0V on pin1 of ROM and around 1.1V on <SIGNAL>SPI_MLB_CS_L</SIGNAL> / <SIGNAL>SPI_SMC_CS_L</SIGNAL>. Also, I've confirmed that <SIGNAL>SPI_MLB_CS_L</SIGNAL> / <SIGNAL>SPI_SMC_CS_L</SIGNAL> will measure 3.3V on a good board with no ROM or <CHIP>U6101</CHIP> installed."

I had the open result because I had <CHIP>U6101</CHIP> reversed.  As far as the ROM swap, it's only for testing. No intention of leaving them that way. To be sure of things, I tested this boards ROM and <CHIP>U6101</CHIP> on my known-good board and it powers up normally.\n\nSo the problem is with <SIGNAL>SPI_MLB_CS_L</SIGNAL> / <SIGNAL>SPI_SMC_CS_L</SIGNAL> not hitting 3.3V. It's at around 1.1V. It looks <SIGNAL>SPI_SMC_CS_L</SIGNAL> comes from the SMC. Diode measurements on that line are at .615 versus .515 on a good board."
