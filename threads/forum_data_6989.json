Light corrosion in a few places (see pics) including the area around the SPI ROM chip. SPI_SMC_CS_L is measuring 1.38V instead of 3.3V. PPVRTC_G3H is measuring 3.3V.\nPP3V3_S4 is at around 0.3V, then it slowly drops, and then jumps up to 3.3 for split-second. SYSCLK_CLK25M_X1 is at 0.8V and SYSCLK_CLK25M_X2 is at 0.06V. Because I don't know if you should have a clock at this point I replaced U1900 and Y1905. Not sure where to go next."}

And no change after installing known-good ROM and factory U6101 from other 00165 board. It still gets 0V on pin1 of ROM and around 1.1V on SPI_MLB_CS_L \/ SPI_SMC_CS_L.

As far as the ROM swap, it's only for testing. No intention of leaving them that way. To be sure of things, I tested this boards ROM and U6101 on my known-good board and it powers up normally.\n\nSo the problem is with SPI_MLB_CS_L \/ SPI_SMC_CS_L not hitting 3.3V. It's at around 1.1V. It looks SPI_SMC_CS_L comes from the SMC. Diode measurements on that line are at .615 versus .515 on a good board."}
