        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "DP_INT_HPD": "What is DP_INT_HPD? a SIGNAL.",

        "PP3V3_S0SW_LCD": "What is PP3V3_S0SW_LCD? PP3V3_S0SW_LCD is a 3.3v power rail necessary to power the image circuitry on the screen. This is necessary to get a picture on the screen. .",
        "EDP_BKLT_PWM": "What is EDP_BKLT_PWM? EDP_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

            "message": "This board was liquid damage, no power, with the lcd flex burned, connector on the board is intact. \nI Fixed the liquid and managed to get the board to boot, however there is backlight but no image. I tested different screens known to be working. \nI also ruled out lcd flex cable, ssd, pram and bios.\n\nThe board fully boots and it can even display an image on external monitor. I checker the <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> signals and compared to anoher board and they are good, althought If <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> was tripped I would normally not see a backlight.\n\nHere are the signals and power rails I measured:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL>: 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>: 49V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL>: 5V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_ALSCAM_F</SIGNAL>: 5V\n\n<SIGNAL>LCD_IRQ_L</SIGNAL>: 0V (same on known working board) \n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_HPD</SIGNAL>: 3.28V\n<SIGNAL>BUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>: 3.3V\n\n<SIGNAL>TCON_BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL>: 2.746V\n<SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL>: 3.039V\n\n<SIGNAL>I2C_TCON_SDA_CONN</SIGNAL>: 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>I2C_TCON_SCL_CONN</SIGNAL>: 3.3V\n\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT</SIGNAL> lines Voltage / diode mode reading:\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_ML_P</SIGNAL><0>: 0.47V / 0.210\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_ML_N</SIGNAL><0>: 0.47V / 0.210\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_ML_P</SIGNAL><1>: 0.47V / 0.210\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_ML_N</SIGNAL><1>: 0.47V / 0.210\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_ML_P</SIGNAL><2>: 0.47V / 0.210\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_ML_N</SIGNAL><2>: 0.47V / 0.210\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_ML_P</SIGNAL><3>: 0.47V / 0.210\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_ML_N</SIGNAL><3>: 0.47V / 0.210\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_AUX_P</SIGNAL>:            0V / 0.210 (same on known working board) \n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_AUX_N</SIGNAL>:        3.3V / 0.210\n\nI suspect the cpu went bad via some edp pins on J8500 but I am here to try anything I may not think about.\nI have no more idea.
