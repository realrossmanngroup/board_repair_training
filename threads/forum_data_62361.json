I tested different screens known to be working. \nI also ruled out lcd flex cable, ssd, pram and bios.\n\nThe board fully boots and it can even display an image on external monitor. I checker the SMC_LID signals and compared to anoher board and they are good, althought If SMC_lid was tripped I would normally not see a backlight.\n\nHere are the signals and power rails I measured:\n\nPP3V3_S0SW_LCD: 3.3V\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT: 49V\nPP5V_S0SW_LCD: 5V\nPP5V_S0_ALSCAM_F: 5V\n\nLCD_IRQ_L: 0V (same on known working board) \nDP_INT_HPD: 3.28V\nBUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN: 3.3V\n\nTCON_BKLT_PWM: 2.746V\nEDP_BKLT_PWM: 3.039V\n\nI2C_TCON_SDA_CONN: 3.3V\nI2C_TCON_SCL_CONN: 3.3V\n\nEDP_INT lines Voltage \/ diode mode reading:\nEDP_INT_ML_P<0>: 0.47V \/ 0.210\nEDP_INT_ML_N<0>: 0.47V \/ 0.210\nEDP_INT_ML_P<1>: 0.47V \/ 0.210\nEDP_INT_ML_N<1>: 0.47V \/ 0.210\nEDP_INT_ML_P<2>: 0.47V \/ 0.210\nEDP_INT_ML_N<2>: 0.47V \/ 0.210\nEDP_INT_ML_P<3>: 0.47V \/ 0.210\nEDP_INT_ML_N<3>: 0.47V \/ 0.210\nEDP_INT_AUX_P:            0V \/ 0.210 (same on known working board) \nEDP_INT_AUX_N:        3.3V \/ 0.210\n\nI suspect the cpu went bad via some edp pins on J8500 but I am here to try anything I may not think about.\nI have no more idea. Thanks!"}
