            "message": "I tried another BIOS but the same, also did a pram reset for good measure but that didnt seem to work at all, no flash in the display. So the mac spins 3x, then the display turns on but stays black. Option key also did not respond. After a minute or so fan starts to spin high (not that I only have the IO board, external USB keyboard, fan, SSD and display connected). I put the old ROM back, same issue.\n\nPS I did notice the ROM is different. This is a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B and I have many of those lying around but all of them have a ROM that looks like the one in the image on the right side, the left one is the one soldered on the board as you can see:\n\n[url]https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tz4NMVshS2gxrDQ9jnSfxLHe7DygGVnt[/url]\n\nAny thoughts on this?"
