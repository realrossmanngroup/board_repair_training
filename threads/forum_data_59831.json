Below are the voltages I still do not have:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> 0v - applied 5v on this line and the fan goes fast and the speed of the fan will sometimes surge up and down a little.\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_LDO</SIGNAL> 2.5v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3SW_SNS</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3S</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> 0v\n\nAll other rails are good and checked for shorts on all the lines above and none are showing a short.\n\nUnplugged battery, no change, still no fan.\n\nAlso on the USB voltage tester, the amps will fluctuate a little, .12a to 0 amps every 2-3 seconds.\n\nJust curious if anyone has some clues of what I am missing?\n\nAs a side note, with me replacing the <CHIP>U7650</CHIP>, does the T2 chip have to be synced with that chip now? Also before changing the <CHIP>U7650</CHIP>, it was the only chip that was getting hot to the touch, and thus I thought it might be the cause of the issue and because there was a lot of corrosion around this chip.\n\nThanks"

About 8 caps were either out of place or the wrong ones. So after transferring everything over from the donor board that was around <CHIP>U7650</CHIP>, I now get the board to boot. I have 19.8v and 2amps at my usb meter. All my previous voltages are now there, but now I have no video on the screen or on my remote monitor and no caps lock light. But I can  reset the T2 chip via right shift left control option and power button, and my usb meter will shut off and come right back on at the same measurements above. \n\nWhat is my next move? \n\nThanks"

When I first plug in thumb drive the light will come on for 2 seconds solid and then never blinks or stays lit after that. Tried both ports still no usb functions.\n\nAlso just noticed that when I force this to shut down by holding the power button down, it will restart itself (can hear the fan spin up and trackpad feedback). Update: Disconnected keyboard/trackpad and stopped restarting on its own. However with another working board installed, it did not restart on its own.\n\nAlso just as a note, it will not go into DFU mode, but maybe because I have no USB functions??\n\nCPU issue? Where would I start to measure at for no caps light and no usb functions? Thanks"

Before there was always fluctuating in the amps.\nSo i went ahead and tried DFU mode with another 2018 MBA and tried several cables and never went into DFU mode.\n\nSo I went back and and measured the pins you asked to measure on <CHIP>U7650</CHIP>. Now there are no volts on any pins except for pins 23 and 22 they are the same.\n\nSo do you think I might have killed one or both of the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s?? I went ahead and ordered more of these since I was out of stock.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> is now 0v (before heating up those chips I had 5v) except if I plug just the battery into board and leave the usb charger off I get 5 volts back on that line and if I plug the USB meter back in with the charging cord, the usb meter will not even light up until I unplug the battery. That was new to me, so I must of really screwed up those <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> when I heated them up is my guess.\n\nI still have 12.3v on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and 3.3v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 5.14v. No shorts on any lines still.\n\nAnything else to check before I get those chips?\n\nThanks"
