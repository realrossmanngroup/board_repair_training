I'm working on an Air <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a liquid damaged which i managed to power on. Had damange near SMC, battery controller tps 625, 51980a and few other places. Contacts renewed everywhere that needed. The issue is that when i have the battery and charger plugged in not powering on or if i power on on charger and then plug in the battery it turns off the adapter completely. Also i replaced the charging controller which i took out from an old board for parts. Any advice please? THANKS :D"
