I've zoomed in on pins and can see clearly no bridges on pins, all pins are solid to board and inside the connector the distances between the top and bottom pins are the same with door closed on the connector. Figured it must be the keyboard and tried a new keyboard and same keys are not working... could this be board trace on one of the pins?"

Keyboard works with jumper to pin 15 of <CHIP>U4820</CHIP>. \nSomething is scrambling this Mac though. As stated before it runs right on Safe Boot but regular boot there's a lag. Fresh install of Catalina. I tried booting off external El Capitan and same lag so it doesn't appear to be related to SSD. \n\nAny suggestions? This had liquid damage but only noticeable evidence of that is red dot on battery and feedback from seller. Board had to have been at least cleaned. No noticeable residue. I believe the fan connector and keyboard connector were damaged by previous tech as prior owner said it worked some prior to taking it to repair shop. I assume then they broke the connector and then it appeared it was dead as the power button wouldn't have worked."
