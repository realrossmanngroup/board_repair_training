Got this board come in...\n\nThis one got a hole in the PCB - gone pretty deep.\n\nFirst time I seen this.\n\nMy question is: should i even bother? wouldnt all the traces inside be gone/many broken lines?\nWhat would you guys do with something like this? Donor pile?\n\nThanks"

You'll need a new home for <TRANSISTOR>Q8930</TRANSISTOR> as wires need to run to this FET.\n\nIf you do achieve this you'll need luck the GPU wont need to be replaced.\n\nI would pass on this,"
