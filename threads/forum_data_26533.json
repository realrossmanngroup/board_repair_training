If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

The production boards do not have current sensing for the backlight.\n\n6.57V is not a valid voltage. It is either 8.5V or about 2.8V which you can calculate from the resistor divider <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR>. Question now is the voltage on pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR>. I assume you are measuring this with the LCD connected and that you have an image on the screen."

Also look at the diagram and tell me what would happen if you install <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> the \"wrong\" way. Understanding how this works is essential in being able to diagnose this stuff.\n\nSo the conclusion here is that the gate of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is not being pulled down low enough. This could be a dead <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> or a corroded trace. Wrong value for <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR> would also cause issues. Check both resistor values and traces. The last option could be a dead <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>.\n\nFor testing you could just bypass <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> pin 4 to 5 and the backlight should work."
