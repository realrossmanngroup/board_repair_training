        "820-2523": "What is 820-2523? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "PPBUS_CPU_IMVP_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_CPU_IMVP_ISNS? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_ONOF_L": "What is SMC_ONOF_L? This is a typo of SMC_ONOFF_L When you see SMC_ONOF_L, assume they meant to type SMC_ONOFF_L.",
        "C6990": "What is C6990? Capacitor to ground on input to PP3V42_G3H power supply. PP3V42_G3H power supply turns 18.5v from charger or 8.5v-12.5v PPBUS_G3H from the battery into PP3V42_G3H. This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger.",
