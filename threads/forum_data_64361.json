        "820-3462": "What is 820-3462? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "PP1V8_S0": "What is PP1V8_S0? PP1V8_S0 is a power rail that is present when the machine is in an S0 state, meaning it is fully turned on, not sleeping or hiberating .",

Fans are spinning.\nThe board is able to charge the battery, and remains powered on if i unplug the charger or the battery. This part of the circuitry seems working.\nI get the orange light on the charger, until the battery is fully charged.\n\nI measured 0.92V on <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> and 3.32V on <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWR_GOOD</SIGNAL>.\nDid a few random check here and there; \n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL>: 12.52V\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL>: 12.54V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>: 3.42V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL>: 3.33V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>: 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0</SIGNAL>: 1.79V\n\nThe heatsink is warm; <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> is warm (circa 60°C), and the coils L7510, L7520, L7550 and L7630 are warm too, (70°C)\n\nI found these posts: [URL]https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3462</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-no-chime.3779/[/URL] and [URL]https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3462</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-no-chime-no-display.32104/[/URL] but original author didnt mention whether they found the cause.\n\nThere are no sign of liquid damage. Any clue ?"
