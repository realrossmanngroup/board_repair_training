The customer said it came in contact with rain and they had the corrosion cleaned at a local shop(looked like they just ipa and brushed it and not ultrasonic). I ultrasonic'd the board and still no change.\nPrevious board with similar issue:  [URL=\"https:\/\/www.rossmanngroup.com\/boards\/forum\/board-repair-troubleshooting\/21084-820-4924-pulsing-voltages-not-turning-on\"]https:\/\/www.rossmanngroup.com\/boards...not-turning-on[\/URL]\n\nCustomer's Note: \"It was water damaged in moderate rain, left vertical in a backpack. An anti-corrosion treatment at Retech saw it working again for a month before the working laptop stopped charging and the battery drained.\"\n\nI get a green light that turns orange so I assume 3v42 is fine.\nPPBUS_G3H starts at 13.69v(not sure why its so high) then quickly goes down to around 3v then back up to 13.69v and repeats\nPP5V_S5\/S3\/S0, PPVCC_S0_CPU all keep cycling from there original voltages.\nU1950 looks good and Pin 2 also cycles. U6100 looks like there was liquid near there but no corrosion visible and the traces look great.\nI replaced some components most of which were connected to PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING due to some bad looking caps.\nReplaced C7317\/18, C7310\/11,R7311,U7310, C7620\/22\nU7200 Pins 7-10 didn't look good so I replaced the entire chip but that still didn't solve this."}
