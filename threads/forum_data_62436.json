            "message": "Hi Guys,\n\nI am a new member and what a nice forum you made. Jumping on to the topic. We have a liquid damaged Macbook <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2179</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, and we need your help to fix it. We observed corrosions between <TRANSISTOR>Q7660</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7680</TRANSISTOR> chips. Cleaning with isopropyl and applying some Amtech flux to resolder. \n\nWhen the board connects to the charging cable 61W AC adapter, the USB-C amp meter shows 5v. Amper meters start with 0mA, after 1 second, 100mA and then 230mA, then back to 00 and continues. It loops. \n\nWe have the main power rail <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12.28v (should be 12.60v). But it should be 12.60. \n\nChecked the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> Chips responsible for power management. Both input and LDOs are there.  \n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> - 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_UPC_X_LDO_CORE</SIGNAL> - 1.5v OK\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_X_LDO</SIGNAL>      - 3.3v OK\n\nBasically, I do not see any problems with <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> but I might be wrong. So next step is to check if the charger receives <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and it receives it (12.28v).\n\nThen I decided to check the <SIGNAL>CHGR_EN_MVR</SIGNAL> that is signal coming from Charger (<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>) to <CHIP>U6960</CHIP>. I am using Siglent Digital Occiloscope to measure this. So I turned on the mainboard and the Siglent Occiloscope was connected to the ground and <RESISTOR>R6960</RESISTOR> (1pin). the signal is missing. Normally I should see a straight line but nothing is there. I do not know if something is preventing this signal or charger failed or maybe T2 Chip/T2 Data related issue. \n\nI attached the picture of the corrosion area as well. \n\nI am lost in the board scheme and cannot move further to troubleshoot the issue. I also referred to this link --> [URL]https://logi.wiki/index.php/CD3217_and_T2_Power_on_Sequence[/URL]\n\nPlease advise what are the next steps for troubleshooting. \n\nBig thanks.\nZeyd"

I put this mainboard to the working MacBook Pro. USB-C meter shows 20.3v and 0.00 amps. It is not using any power. \n\nOriginal MacBook has burned areas and I attached pictures of it here so that you better understand the damage. I am missing also the <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> power rail on this mainboard. I do not know if this is always-on power rail or not. Please check the attached pictures.\n\nIs it possible to test caps and make sure they are working or not?"
