I guess I just had dead SMC's. Computer needs a new battery, new keyboard, new trackpad, new LCD, and board repair. Customer is going to buy a new computer. SOOOOOOO all that effort was for nothing. Transfered the SMC back to the working board and it still works perfectly. I was getting so mad at the other SMC's"
