        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. ."

I guess I just had dead SMC's. Computer needs a new battery, new keyboard, new trackpad, new LCD, and board repair. Customer is going to buy a new computer. SOOOOOOO all that effort was for nothing. Transfered the SMC back to the working board and it still works perfectly. I was getting so mad at the other SMC's"
