At the moment the board is in a state of not booting up properly...will use 300 to 400 mA and then drop to 25mA with some fan spin.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.56V\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.438V\nPP5V_S5 = 5.03V\nSMC_RESET_L = 3.43V\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3.324V\nPP5V_S4RS3 = 0V\nPP5V_S0=0V\nPM_DSW_PWRGD = 3.43 V\nALL_SYS_PWRGD = 0V"}
