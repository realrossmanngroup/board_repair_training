Charges, etc... just fine.\n\nThis machine has the fans running full speed.\n\nI've run ASD and I get these sensor errors:\n\nTA0P -- Ambient Air Sensor (ERROR - SMC IO FAILED)\nTA1P -- DC-IN Proximity for Airflow (ERROR - SMC IO FAILED)\nTC0P -- CPU Proximity (ERROR - SMC IO FAILED)\nTM0P -- DDR3 Proximity (ERROR - SMC IO FAILED)\nTW0P -- AirPort Proximity (ERROR - SMC IO FAILED)\n\nI have not been able to locate liquid damage (and I am the only one to take machine apart.)\n\nEverything seems to run the way it should. It does not have an error on Ts0P for the trackpad, that test actually passes.\n\nIs there a certain area of the board I should be focusing my efforts on?\n\nThank You!"

Cleaned up the areas and BAM, no more loud fan and passes ASD now. Not sure why it would cause the sensor issues?? Any idea? But this can be marked fixed (not so much solved, but fixed)\n\nThanks!"
