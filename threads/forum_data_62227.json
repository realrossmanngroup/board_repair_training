        "A1369": "What is A1369? A1369 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Late 2010, Mid 2011 with EMC 2392, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2838, 820-3023..",
        "820-2838": "What is 820-2838? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "PP3V3_S3": "What is PP3V3_S3? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. ."
