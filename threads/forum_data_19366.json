        "message":"I got in a couple of these 820-00138 machines today. They had small amounts of liquid damage around the lcd connector. the board powers on no internal video, fans go full speed. i have the schematic but can't seem to find a board view for this machine. the machine didn't come with the original hdd, so not sure i can even run onboard diag test. \n\nany ideas?"
