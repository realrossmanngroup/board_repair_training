        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence.."

            "message": "Hello,\nfirst of all sorry for my bad english ;). I have a Problem with an older <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. It has a green light on the charger but didn´t turn on. I short the pads on <RESISTOR>R5015</RESISTOR> but nothing happens. Than i checked the Powerrails and <SIGNAL>PPV5_S3</SIGNAL> is 0V (everything til there was fine). I followed this path to <CHIP>U7201</CHIP>. Vin of <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> is 12,6V, Vref is 1,9V, Entrip2 is 0,7V (i guess thats ok) and Entrip1 is 0V. (<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> on right side of <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> is there) I followed Entrip1 to <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> and came to the conclusion, that i need <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> to get Entrip1 pass <CHIP>U7210</CHIP>. Pin 5 (<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>) is 0V. Than i checked if <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S5_MCP</SIGNAL> turns the MCP on and it´s reading is 1,1V. <CHIP>U7750</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR> seem to be fine to. I can´t see any waterdamage or other visible damage on the board. At this point i don´t know where to look next. It would be realy great if someone could give me an advice what to check next in a case like this. \nBest regards\nFelix"

I don´t know why but in the moment as i was measuring and shorting the pads at the same time <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> droped from 3,4V to 0V and the board srarts to spin the fans and seems to work normally. I shorted the pads many times bevore and noting happend so i have no idea wat fixes it. Is this commom failure and will it have this problem again in near future?\nThank you very much for your help\nFelix"
