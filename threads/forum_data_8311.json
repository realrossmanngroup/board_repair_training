I have a Problem with an older 820-2330. It has a green light on the charger but didn\u00b4t turn on. I short the pads on R5015 but nothing happens. Than i checked the Powerrails and PPV5_S3 is 0V (everything til there was fine). I followed this path to U7201. Vin of U7201 is 12,6V, Vref is 1,9V, Entrip2 is 0,7V (i guess thats ok) and Entrip1 is 0V. (PP3V3_S3 on right side of U7201 is there) I followed Entrip1 to U7210 and came to the conclusion, that i need PM_SLP_S4_L to get Entrip1 pass U7210. Pin 5 (PM_SLP_S4_L) is 0V. Than i checked if PP1V05_S5_MCP turns the MCP on and it\u00b4s reading is 1,1V. U7750 and C7771 seem to be fine to. I can\u00b4t see any waterdamage or other visible damage on the board. At this point i don\u00b4t know where to look next. It would be realy great if someone could give me an advice what to check next in a case like this. \nBest regards\nFelix"}

I shorted the pads many times bevore and noting happend so i have no idea wat fixes it.
