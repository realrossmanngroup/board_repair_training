I have replaced with another battery but still does the same thing . the machine charges the battery okay , and powers okay with the charger connected, also when the charger is removed, it remains on with the battery attached . have checked the battery SCL and SDA signal including current sensing , which are okay. would appreciate if am posted to where else I could check , thanks guys"}
