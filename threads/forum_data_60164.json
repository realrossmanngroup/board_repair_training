First i fixed flexgate just to make sure that it will run properly and since it's no picture issue of course no change. The laptop powers on fan spins and then just stays like that and it was not liquid damaged. Some time ago the client went to so called Apple official and they replaced the top case(keyboard housing) complete for no reason besides some keys pressing hard(probably from dust). Any ideas ?\n\nThanks"
