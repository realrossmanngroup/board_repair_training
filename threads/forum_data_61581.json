( J6951 )\nWith the battery BMS connected it just bounces and resets.  ( I have changed the battery using a tester and get the same result! )\n\nI diode checked <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3H_SDL</SIGNAL> / SCA and both are normal\nI checked <SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_L</SIGNAL> it also appeared normal\n\nHistory on this system.\nIt was serviced by another technician for screen replacement.   They changed the screen and this was the result.   The original screen is back on and does function with the same defect it had before ( lines across the bottom of the screen ) and works normally if the BMS is disconnected.\n\nSMC?  What the heck?"
