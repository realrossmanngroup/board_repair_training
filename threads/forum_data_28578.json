        "A1398": "What is A1398? A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",
        "820-00138": "What is 820-00138? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U7001": "What is U7001? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC? SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC is a voltage that is created if SMC_BC_ACOK & PP3V42_G3H are both present that powers the chipset for the onewire circuit that allows the SMC to talk to the charger on the SYS_ONEWIRE line. This is necessary for the magsafe charger to have a light on it. .",
        "R5087": "What is R5087? a RESISTOR.",
        "R5187": "What is R5187? a RESISTOR.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015."

The ISL chip (<CHIP>U7100</CHIP>) gets warm I've got good readings at both <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. Some concerns I have is I have no readings for <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC</SIGNAL> and my reading for <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> for both pin 1/2 is showing around 1.8V. Also my <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> voltage is showing at 0.7V. My U700 only gives voltage at <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> and <CHIP>U7001</CHIP> at pin 1/2 and pin 5 (<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>).\n\nI've looked at every possible components linked to these for shorts but to no avail. I was hoping if someone can shine some light to my situation or give me some general guidance in how to diagnose macbooks.\n\nAlso I am using the 85W charger for this board so my readings should be accurate.\n\nThank you,\nSam"
