If 8.5, then bad battery. If 8.1, then issue around the ISL or SMC more than likely. SMC often the cause."}

I would test it extensively before giving it back to customer prob ultrasonic it again as well. I have had boards where you can heat the SMC and it will work, but when it cools, it stops working. Definitely test it thoroughly before calling it good."}
