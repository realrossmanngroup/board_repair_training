            "message": "Hello there\nOn the motherboard <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115B</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, there was water damage. I cleaned oxidised components. When it first arrived, it didn't turn on at all. I heated SMC and it did turn on. However, it doesn't charge the battery and the orange light is not on. Is this because of SMC? How can I make sure it's because of SMC or not? When I pull the plug, it continues to run on battery. On <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR>, first, second and third pins get 12 volts, the fourth pin also gets 12 volts, however the fifth pin gets 11 volts."
