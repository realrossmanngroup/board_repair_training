I cleaned oxidised components. When it first arrived, it didn't turn on at all. I heated SMC and it did turn on. However, it doesn't charge the battery and the orange light is not on. Is this because of SMC? How can I make sure it's because of SMC or not? When I pull the plug, it continues to run on battery. On Q7055, first, second and third pins get 12 volts, the fourth pin also gets 12 volts, however the fifth pin gets 11 volts."}
