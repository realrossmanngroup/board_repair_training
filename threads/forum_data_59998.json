I did not find any water damage and the fuse was good.   So I replaced the driver IC U7701 and that fixed the problem  \"almost\" The machine isn't quite right.  Along the bottom left of the screen you can tell that some of the back light LEDs are not properly functioning and this makes that side a little darker.  See the picture.\n\nI have encountered this before and ended up replacing the driver ic to fix it so I tried another one just incase and it did not solve the problem.\nI checked R7717-R7722 and they were all good.   I also checked all the resistors around U7701 as well as replaced it a second time.  This issue shows up on both the original screen and my test screen so it is definitely the LB.\n\nR7721 and R7722 (BKL ISEN5 & BLK ISEN6) are both reading 4-8v which is not right.  There is not muchere except for the plug and U770.  I really don't have a solid understanding on exactly how this circuit works.  I have looked at J8300 very closely under the microscope and can't find anything wrong with it."}

Probably just a bad LP8550. Are you installing new chips, or re-balling used ones? If re-balling, you gotta make sure they're all perfect and the same size. Check all the LED_RETURN lines of course (just check diode mode at the connector-side resistors). I bet one will read .000. Consider that someone might have damaged the LCD connector (look inside of it), which is what damaged the original LP8550. You might have a good LP8550 now, but a bad connector still. If connector is fine, just replace LP8550 again."}

All .633.  Replaced J8300.  Same issue.   I will harvest a LP8550 from a known working board.  Hard to believe as I have replaced the LP8550 3 times already but there is nothing left.\n\nThat fixed it!  Screwed by the Chinese again!\nWhere should I get these chips!  This is not my first rodeo.   I know these were balled and flowed perfectly!\n\nI even split balled the thing this last time and presto!"}

Gotta make sure your pads are perfectly clean and chip is re-balled well. Honestly, most times I see this issue, it's caused by uneven solder and not \"necessarily\" a bad chip. But I re-ball them all myself usually, pulled from parts boards (tired of getting the choppy backlight LP8550's). If you bought these \"new\", then yes, avoid that seller."}

Will give that a try. Any instructions on how to create the Linux LiveUSB (mainly, where to obtain Linux, etc)? I've never messed with Linux before, but assume the process is the same as creating a MacOS USB drive.\n\nWill be a bit of a process to do this for every single backlight repair with the new backlight drivers, but at least it will prevent customers from asking about why it's choppy."}
