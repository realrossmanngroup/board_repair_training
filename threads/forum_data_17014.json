The board barely had water damage on the corner where LCD connector was located from water bottle in back pack.  I cleaned the area up with flux and reflowed the bad looking solder joints.  Connector J8300 pin 36,37,38,39,40,41 - Connector J4915 pin 4,  <CHIP>U8300</CHIP>  and on the reverse side of board the only thing I saw that had corrosion was <CAPACITOR>C7778</CAPACITOR>, check for short here and none.. I cleaned it all up and reflow with new solder.   It boots up and chimes and also with the external screen via with HDMI output I got image and can use the laptop.  The LCD male connector on the display looks clean and solid.  I took measurements at the board connector and only have 5.1v at pin 3 and 5.1v on pin 4 and  all other pin is 0v.  I check <CAPACITOR>C8320</CAPACITOR>- <CAPACITOR>C8328</CAPACITOR> all is present ... I don't have extra display to test.  Am I on the right track."
