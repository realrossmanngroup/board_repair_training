Believe i've found the issue, or at least some of the issues. The client somehow ripped a bunch of components from the board i'm assuming during removal. Anyway, the boardview that i have, though it's for this part number, seems to be slightly different from the actual board. See pics. Does anyone have the correct board view they can help with. \n\n[ATTACH]59283[/ATTACH][ATTACH]59282[/ATTACH]"
