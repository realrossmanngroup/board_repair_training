I switched out the diode and had a good ppbus of 12.6v. I think I still had other issues as it was not pulling hardly any amps. I was wondering about the missing green light on the charger and noticed one of the power pins was pushed in. So I grabbed an after marker charger which we have used for ages(we have gotten rid of all of them, expect this one was still laying around) to see if I would get the green light back, which I did. Then I was taking voltages for all of the isl6258 pins for future reference. Then I noticed it was no longer working anymore. D7010 is bad again. While measuring it I noticed the after marker charger is giving 18.9 volts, could this have been what caused it or just coincidence? I am leaning towards coincidence since something had to have killed D7010 before and it is likely the same thing. Should I track another diode down and try again?\n\nedit added\/\/\nfor replacement diodes, what things should I be looking for in the schematics so I can check donor boards?"}
