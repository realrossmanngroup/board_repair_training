Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year retina model macbook pros, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on.

            "message": "Well, this was interesting. I switched out the diode and had a good ppbus of 12.6v. I think I still had other issues as it was not pulling hardly any amps. I was wondering about the missing green light on the charger and noticed one of the power pins was pushed in. So I grabbed an after marker charger which we have used for ages(we have gotten rid of all of them, expect this one was still laying around) to see if I would get the green light back, which I did. Then I was taking voltages for all of the <CHIP>ISL6258</CHIP> pins for future reference. Then I noticed it was no longer working anymore. <DIODE>D7010</DIODE> is bad again. While measuring it I noticed the after marker charger is giving 18.9 volts, could this have been what caused it or just coincidence? I am leaning towards coincidence since something had to have killed <DIODE>D7010</DIODE> before and it is likely the same thing. Should I track another diode down and try again?\n\nedit added//\nfor replacement diodes, what things should I be looking for in the schematics so I can check donor boards?"
