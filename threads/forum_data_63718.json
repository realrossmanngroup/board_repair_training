I can confirm that the lid sensor was also damaged but i fixed that too. now the issue is when i try to restart, i have to cut power completely, unplug battery and DC and plug back in to turn on. if i perform a restart through macOS. it'll stay off but the trackpad will click for a second and then turn off and then click for a second and just cycle like that. other than that the machine works indefinitely"

So essentailly to get it to turn on again i would have to unplug DC and then unplug the battery and plug it all back in. then it will come back on... until i shut it down. Then if i try to turn it on the trackpad will have click for about a second, then stop, then click again. As if it's bootlooping... until i cut all power and start again"
