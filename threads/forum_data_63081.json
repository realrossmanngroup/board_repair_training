        "A1708": "What is A1708? A1708 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2017, 2016 with EMC 3164, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00840, 820-00875..",
        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA": "What is PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA? This is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad. Each CD3215 in the system needs to be functioning in order for any of them to speak to the charger and negotiate receiving 20v from the charger rather than the default 5v that a USB-C charger puts out before communicating with the system. .",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "U3200": "What is U3200? a CHIP.",
        "Q3200": "What is Q3200? a TRANSISTOR."

Both ports was totally corroded, replace the port and I get in resold one working port and the other one is not working stuck on 5V 0.00A \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> not showing up once connected to not working port \nreplaced port second time/didn't resolve problem\nreplaced CD3215C00 from good source / didn't resolve problem \nStarted comparing resistance on port they seams to be all fine compare to working board, no shorts around the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> \n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA</SIGNAL> present when charger connected to not working port \n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 0.11V when connected to not working port \nAny ideas ? \nThank you"
