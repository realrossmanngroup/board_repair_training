Now the issue is the battery icon has an x when logged in. System report says 0 cycles and service recommended. Fan speed is normal. \nIm still pretty new to m1 stuff so here is what i know so far-\nBattery connected \n<SIGNAL>PPVBAT_AON</SIGNAL> - 11.6v\n<SIGNAL>PPVBAT_AON_CHARGER_REG</SIGNAL> -12.01 v\n<SIGNAL>PPVBAT_AON_CHGR_R</SIGNAL> - 12.01v\nSys detect - 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>I2C_SMC_PWR_3V3_SCL</SIGNAL>-2.2v\n<SIGNAL>I2C_SMC_PWR_3V3_SDA</SIGNAL>-3.1c\n\nWhen battery was disconnected i checked <SIGNAL>CHGR_BGATE</SIGNAL> and it was 12.01v\n\nSo there was liquid damage on j5151 on pin 2 and 7 and then had detached. I solder them back and some liquid near <CHIP>U5200</CHIP> so cleaned that and checked for any shorts. None detected.\nAlso diode mode to ground on <SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_L</SIGNAL> and it was 0.404. \n\nWhat should i do next?"
