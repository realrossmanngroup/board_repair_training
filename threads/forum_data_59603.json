Replaced it, Q7130, Q7135, Q7155 and R7105 (measured kohm instead of 20ohm) also. U7100 got warm so I replaced Inrush Limiter mosfets from a donor board (in this model there are 2 mosfets but in schematics it shows only one - Q7180). U7100 still gets warm. Measured resistance on every pin on U7100  and nothing is wrong.\nI tried charging the battery and CHGR_PHASE measures about 13,2V which normally is 12,6V."}

Pin 23 and 25 (CHGR_BOOT and CHGR_PHASE) are shorted (0ohm between) and R7121 and R7122 measures in kohm in stead of 20 ohm before.  just replaced U7100 and after plugging power in measured 1,6V on CHGR_PHASE. Disconnected power and CHGR_BOOT and CHGR_PHASE again shorted."}
