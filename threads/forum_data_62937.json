And yes I do get 1V1 LDO on each <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> when the corresponding port is plugged in.\n\nI decided to check the scl/sda bus between SMC (SoC) and XA and XB Ports and found out <SIGNAL>I2C_UPC_SDA</SIGNAL> full short at <RESISTOR>R5200</RESISTOR> pin2.\nSo it's either <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>/<CHIP>U3100</CHIP>/<CHIP>U3900</CHIP> (T2). If it ends up to be the T2 chip I guess it's game over :)\n\nBefore starting to remove <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> I will try to do a backup with battery fully charged.\nSince I have no way to connect an external device on usbc I plan to use some airdrop/cloud thing to transfer manually important files. Do you have a better suggestion to backup wirelessly?\n\nI will of course report for the short after the backup\nThanks"
