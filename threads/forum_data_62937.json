And yes I do get 1V1 LDO on each CD3215 when the corresponding port is plugged in.\n\nI decided to check the scl\/sda bus between SMC (SoC) and XA and XB Ports and found out I2C_UPC_SDA full short at R5200 pin2.\nSo it's either U3200\/U3100\/U3900 (T2). If it ends up to be the T2 chip I guess it's game over :)\n\nBefore starting to remove U3200 and U3100 I will try to do a backup with battery fully charged.\nSince I have no way to connect an external device on usbc I plan to use some airdrop\/cloud thing to transfer manually important files. Do you have a better suggestion to backup wirelessly?\n\nI will of course report for the short after the backup\nThanks"}
