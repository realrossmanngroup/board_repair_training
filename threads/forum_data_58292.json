I attached a picture. It's not the best but you can see where the spill hit. This will turn on and work fine with an external monitor but if I attach the LCD it won't display anything on either screen. Any ideas or hope to fix this? Or is this just another Touch Bar that will only work on an external monitor?"}

They're all supposed to be in the .700 range so I'm thinking this might be a lost cause."}
