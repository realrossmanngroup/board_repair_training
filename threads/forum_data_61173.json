I decided to replaced the CPU (cpu taken from other board) and the board boot, see wifi, but will not boot into MacOS or boot in Recovery. It start to load then turn off. \n\nHowever, The laptop boot up fine in Ubuntu and works nicely. I can run and complete Ubuntu on the local disk.\n\nI decided to replaced the CPU again (taken from donors board) and same problem :)\n\nI have also replaced CPU from a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and it has same problem.  \n\nIt seems apple don't want us to replaced CPU. \n\nI have no ideas what the problem now.\n\nBoth laptop work very well with Ubuntu. \n\nSebastien"
