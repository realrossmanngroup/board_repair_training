Rookie question - please tell med if further info is needed.\uf04a \nI need help with mbp 2017 tb (A1706 - 829-00923-A) The story is as follows; Mbp is handed over because it shuts down in use. Takes after shut down 0.040 amp and 20 volts. If I remove the battery and start it, it boots normally and works for a while. But shuts down again. The fault is periodic and there are no short circuits. I have replaced the CD3215 controllers (thunderbolt ROM U8090\u2026) on both sides, but the same error continues. I have measured most through, but found no errors. I have two logicboards with the same error. Does anyone know of a solution or an idea for where to start searching? CD3215 has not been reballed\/changed but this is my next attempt. Battery replaced with a new one - same problem. The mbp was handed over with af exploded battery.\nGreetings from Morten\n\n\nGre"}
