            "message": "Hello. Rookie question - please tell med if further info is needed. \nI need help with mbp 2017 tb (<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> - 829-00923-A) The story is as follows; Mbp is handed over because it shuts down in use. Takes after shut down 0.040 amp and 20 volts. If I remove the battery and start it, it boots normally and works for a while. But shuts down again. The fault is periodic and there are no short circuits. I have replaced the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> controllers (thunderbolt ROM <CHIP>U8090</CHIP>…) on both sides, but the same error continues. I have measured most through, but found no errors. I have two logicboards with the same error. Does anyone know of a solution or an idea for where to start searching? <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> has not been reballed/changed but this is my next attempt. Battery replaced with a new one - same problem. The mbp was handed over with af exploded battery.\nGreetings from Morten\n\n\nGre"
