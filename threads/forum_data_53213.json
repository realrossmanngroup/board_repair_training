Am i correct in thinking u7501 pin 12 ~(P5VS5_EN) needs to be present for PP5V_S5_LDO to be on pin 29.?.\nP5VS5_EN seems to be from SMC_PM_G2 presented on R8140 which reads 0v (100ohms), there does not seem to be a short on either side of this resistor (0.524 diode reading).\n\nSMc issue or is my thinking wrong?.\n\nSMC_RESET_L = 3.3v\n\nppbus_g3h = 12.6v\npp3v43 = 3.4v\nppvrtc_g3h = 3.4v"}

I reballed the SMC and fitted properly (tripled checked alignment and placement). After that PP5V_S5_LDO returned and current shot up to 300ma. Now there a short on pp3v3s_5 L7560 on pin 1.  Also short on L7630 also so I think the PCh\/Cpu is bad . Is there a known issue with these boards and CPU\/PCh  dying? This is the 3rd one of these over the last few weeks with dead Cpu\/Pch."}
