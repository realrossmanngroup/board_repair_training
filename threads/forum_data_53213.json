        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP5V_S5_LDO": "What is PP5V_S5_LDO? PP5V_S5_LDO is a 5v rail present when the machine is in a S5 soft off state. .",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2": "What is SMC_PM_G2? This is a typo of SMC_PM_G2_EN When you see SMC_PM_G2, assume they meant to type SMC_PM_G2_EN.",
        "P5VS5_EN": "What is P5VS5_EN? P5VS5_EN is a signal that turns on the PP5V_S5 power rail. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "R8140": "What is R8140? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
