About to pull it out now. Only the second A2141 board I've worked on so not familiar with common problems. Figured I'd ask if this is indicative of anything specific. But it just jumps from 5v to 19v for a few seconds then the meter goes blank like it was short then back to 5v, repeat."}

Yes all ports behave the same. I inspected the board and noticed a loose cap on the mesa circuit (C4955) and reflowed it. There was a bit of dust on the board so I dunked it in the ultrasonic. Plugged the bare board into my BY-3200 cable and it fired right up. Put the board back in top case and it reverted to doing what it did before. I unplugged the battery and it fired right up to the internet recovery screen. So I'm assuming the problem is the battery. Is it a controller issue or are the cells just too low to register? I'd rather not replace an $80 battery if I can get away with charging it at the bare cell bypassing the control board."}
