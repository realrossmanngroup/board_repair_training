        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",

I've checked with a different Bios but no difference.\n\nThere are no pictures on the screen nor the backlight is present.\n<SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is high.\n<SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_LIS</SIGNAL> high\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> 3.3V\n\nThe board is like brain dead. That's not the first time I have seen that on a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and I have never been able to fix these.\n\nAny hint where else I could look?"
