        "message":"Hello,\n\nI have that board which had liquid damage on the top edge around CPU and would not turn on.\nAfter fixing the L7630 area on the left of the CPU and some multiple small areas on the back, especially around Y1915,the board would fan spin and reach an S0 state with both PP1V05_S0 and PPVCC_S0_CPU present.\nHowever the board will fan spin twice. I've checked with a different Bios but no difference.\n\nThere are no pictures on the screen nor the backlight is present.\nPLT_RESET_L is high.\nPM_SYSRST_Lis high\n\nPM_PCH_PWROK 3.3V\n\nThe board is like brain dead. That's not the first time I have seen that on a 820-00165 and I have never been able to fix these.\n\nAny hint where else I could look?"
