An 0402 resistor, millimeters from the firmware chip, broke off. The schematic and board file both indicate: \"15 0402 5%\". I'm assuming the 15 is ohms. Without any indication of power rating I went with 1\/16W, but this did not change the startup behavior I'm seeing (flashing lights, fans spin for a few seconds, kb backlight goes on and off). Am I reading this resistor wrong? Could the power rating on this resistor be a critical component? thanks in advance...not looking for a repair, just advice on this resistor if that's possible \ud83d\ude0a thanks"}
