Trackpad is only clicking, no moves.\n\nGot new keyboard but same story.\nWith disconnected keyboard trackpad still wont move, but it clicks.\nCant find any burned components near J4801\nAny ideas?\n\nJ4801 Voltages:\n9-10 - 3.43V\n14 - 5.16V\n21 - 3.30V\n23/24/25 - 5.15V\n35/36/37/38/39/40/41 - 8.60V\n\nOrdered new trackpad flex cables but any ideas in the mean time?"
