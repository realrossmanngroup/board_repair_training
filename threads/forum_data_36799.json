The fan will spin up 3 times before staying on when power is applied. Also I have 1.65V on CPUVCORE.\nNo display. Missing <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_OR_PSR_EN</SIGNAL> on pin 1 <RESISTOR>R8319</RESISTOR>. PP5VS4 is present. Checked <CHIP>U8330</CHIP> and I have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> on pin 8. Not sure what I should be getting on pins 5 & 6 to enable\n<SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_OR_PSR_EN</SIGNAL>.\nKnown good display connected.\n\nAlso I will add that I when I plug in USB mouse it will light up as long as its only plugged in half way (like up to the prongs on the port of the board). If I plug in all the way, lights out. This is true as well on the other USB on IO board.\n\nTried to PRAM but don't think it actually worked. Plus I wouldnt be able to hear it chime anyway due to most likely the lack of audio since that is were the only damage is evident.\n\n\nThanks. Have a good one."
