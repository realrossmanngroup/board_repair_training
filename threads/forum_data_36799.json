The fan will spin up 3 times before staying on when power is applied. Also I have 1.65V on CPUVCORE.\nNo display. Missing EDP_PANEL_PWR_OR_PSR_EN on pin 1 R8319. PP5VS4 is present. Checked U8330 and I have PP3V3_S0 on pin 8. Not sure what I should be getting on pins 5 & 6 to enable\nEDP_PANEL_PWR_OR_PSR_EN.\nKnown good display connected.\n\nAlso I will add that I when I plug in USB mouse it will light up as long as its only plugged in half way (like up to the prongs on the port of the board). If I plug in all the way, lights out. This is true as well on the other USB on IO board.\n\nTried to PRAM but don't think it actually worked. Plus I wouldnt be able to hear it chime anyway due to most likely the lack of audio since that is were the only damage is evident.\n\n\nThanks. Have a good one."}

Unless everything is plugged in. \nWhen bench testing they only start up after the 3rd spin up. About 10-15 second. Apples repair guide even mentions that these and retinas will take up to 20 seconds to boot after battery reconnection."}
