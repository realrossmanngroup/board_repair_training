        "message":"Hello\nthis 820-2523-B boots up normally until it nearly finishes loading. Then it shows the attaches picture, shuts off, turns automatically back on and repeats this process. If i want to install OSX with an usb drive it works until i go to the \"disk utility window\" where i normally can create partitions or wipe the drive. In this window, before i can see any drive information, it keeps spinning the \"colored wheel\" - with different drives ans drive cables same thing. The strange thing is that it will boot up normally with a drive from another Macbook with OSX already installed. I\u00b4m really not sure what to do with this one but my guess is Kernel Panic and C9560 but i\u00b4m confused because it works just fine with the other drive. Or could it be a to new version of OSX for this machine on the original drive? Thanks for any help."
