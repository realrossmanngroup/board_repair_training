Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

            "message": "Hello\nthis <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2523</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B boots up normally until it nearly finishes loading. Then it shows the attaches picture, shuts off, turns automatically back on and repeats this process. If i want to install OSX with an usb drive it works until i go to the \"disk utility window\" where i normally can create partitions or wipe the drive. In this window, before i can see any drive information, it keeps spinning the \"colored wheel\" - with different drives ans drive cables same thing. The strange thing is that it will boot up normally with a drive from another Macbook with OSX already installed. I´m really not sure what to do with this one but my guess is Kernel Panic and <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> but i´m confused because it works just fine with the other drive. Or could it be a to new version of OSX for this machine on the original drive? Thanks for any help."
