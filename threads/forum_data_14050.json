            "message": "I am going to oversimplify. 99% of the time, this will be one of four things.\n\n1) <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is shorted to ground.\n2) The IC responsible for creating <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is not receiving power on its VIN/VCC/VDD/voltage input pin.\n3) The IC responsible for creating <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is bad.\n4) The IC responsible for creating <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is not being told to create <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>.\n\n\n<CHIP>TPS51125</CHIP> is an electronic chip, and like all electronic chips, to do something it wants power. What feeds it power? Datasheet says it gets power to do what it does on the VIN pin. VIN, as in, voltage in, as in, power going into it so it can turn on is provided on pin 16. Is pin 16 is getting 12.56v? If not, figure that out. \n\nLooking at the page, on the side where <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is created, we have a pin called \"<SIGNAL>P3V3S5_ENTRIP</SIGNAL>\"... let's guess. P3V3S5 is the name of the rail we are missing. Let's guess what ENTRIP stands for. This means that the chip itself will natrually always create <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, UNLESS you short this pin to ground.\n\nThis is the opposite of chips like <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> on this board. With <CHIP>U9701</CHIP>, you send 3v to the enable pin A3 to turn it on. With <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, voltage is already present at its enable pin, internally, inside the chip. <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> is by default off, and must be enabled to turn on. <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is by default on, and must be \"disabled\" to turn off.\n\nSo in order for <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> to be turned on, voltage must be allowed to be present at pin 6 of <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>. Look at <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR>. What does it do? On pins 3 and 4, ,we have a path where <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_ENTRIP</SIGNAL>[I](which must be present for <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> to turn on)[/I] can go straight to ground. What type of transistor is <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR>? If we google SSM6N37FEAPE, we see it is an N channel MOSFET, meaning the voltage on the gate must be higher than the voltage on the source for it to turn on.\n\nSo, if <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN_L</SIGNAL> is present, it will send <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_ENTRIP</SIGNAL> from <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> to ground, and we won't get anything on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. Note the _L, and the _EN. This is telling. P3V3S5 is our rail - EN means enable, and _L means while low. So, when that signal is LOW, as in 0v, <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR> will not send <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_ENTRIP</SIGNAL> to ground, and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> will be allowed to turn on. So we need <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN_L</SIGNAL> to be low. Where does this come from? \n\n<SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL>.. as in, ENable <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. According to your measurements, we have 3.4v there - so the IC responsible for creating <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is being told to turn on. This crosses out #4 as a possible problem.\n\n<SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN_L</SIGNAL> comes from <CHIP>U7941</CHIP>. <CHIP>U7941</CHIP> takes <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> and turns it into <SIGNAL>P5V3V3_REG_EN</SIGNAL> at 3.3v, and then INVERTS it(note the triangle with a dot on it) to 0v for <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN_L</SIGNAL>. So, if you are getting <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL>, which you are, you're at the first step needed for success. Second step will be, is <CHIP>U7941</CHIP> keeping <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN_L</SIGNAL> low? If it is, it is doing its job - move on. If not, replace <CHIP>U7941</CHIP>.\n\nIf <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN_L</SIGNAL> is low, move on. Does <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> have voltage present on its entrip pin at pin 6 for <SIGNAL>PP3V3S5_ENTRIP</SIGNAL>? If yes, then check for short to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. If no short to ground, then we have to imagine that <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is dead. Replace <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>.\n\nIf <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN_L</SIGNAL> is low, but pin 6 of <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is also low, then we must explore why this is. Either <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is dead, or <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR> is malfunctioning and shorting <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_ENTRIP</SIGNAL> to ground regardless of whether <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN_L</SIGNAL> is present or not. 99% of the time this will be bad <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, but removing <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR> can be done quickly to help confirm."
