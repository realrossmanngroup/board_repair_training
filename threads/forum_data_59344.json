So my question is where can I disable this u3900 to make sure the area is bringing the board down.\n\nif I\u2019m on the wrong Track please help before I derail:) thank you."

I\u2019ve tried for like 10mins and couldn\u2019t get it all the way off. I was gonna use my hot air but it was melting those 2 plastic bubbles near the back cover sensing thing.\n\nI\u2019m gonna go check what you told me and report back  thank you"
