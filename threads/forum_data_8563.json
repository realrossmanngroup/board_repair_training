I'm turning 40 this week so........ anyways the whole damn board was hit with a firehose. No really it was from a fire. It didn't get hot and there was no black marks on it.  The board looked like a bucket full of shit but after the crest cleaning it did show me the battery dead symbol and after that I couldn't get it to boot.   I realize this might be a dead end but I'm really learning so much and you are the man!  Also it worked just for a second arg!  I'd really like to know what the pulse signifies.  Is that a pulse to switch states or is it a short to ground pulse?  My mom says she'll bake you extra special cookies.  I just wish she'd put on a shirt."

There is no easy diagnostic for this problem and even for me would not be an easy repair."
