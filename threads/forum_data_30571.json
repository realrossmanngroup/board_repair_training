I can confirm this every other time I plug in the charger I get a green light and fan spin, but every other time I get no green light and no fan spin. PP3V42: 3.42 PPBUS: 12.28 volts. No power ever with battery plugged in. Is this a dead SMC or should I look elsewhere? Was liquid damage near the DC in port and fuse easy to scrub away with alcohol and toothbrush as no components were burned."
