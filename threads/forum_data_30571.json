        "SMC_ONOFF": "What is SMC_ONOFF? SMC_ONOFF is a signal that tells the machine that the power button has been pressed so it knows to turn on, or turn off. .",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

I can confirm this every other time I plug in the charger I get a green light and fan spin, but every other time I get no green light and no fan spin. PP3V42: 3.42 PPBUS: 12.28 volts. No power ever with battery plugged in. Is this a dead SMC or should I look elsewhere? Was liquid damage near the DC in port and fuse easy to scrub away with alcohol and toothbrush as no components were burned."
