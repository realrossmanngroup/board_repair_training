        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15‚Äù Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",
        "PLT_RESET": "What is PLT_RESET? PLT_RESET stands for platform reset. When this is asserted the machine will not POST. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",

Was able to verify that all major power rails are pulsing but present at correct values and <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET</SIGNAL>)_L pulses also. \n\nResoldered <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> just in case. Tried new BIOS and CLeanME with no change. Liquid indicator was triggered on battery connector but board looks good - a little noticeable residue near the keyboard connector. SMC bypass gets a bit of fan spin but no start.\n\nThinking maybe GPU bypass, Flux and heat CPU or USC the board... Other thoughts?"

Board now boots so should be good to go."
