        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "C7660": "What is C7660? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C8412": "What is C8412? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q7660": "What is Q7660? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP1V2_S3": "What is PP1V2_S3? PP1V2_S3 is a 1.2v power rail present when the machine is in an S3 suspend to RAM state.",
        "PP1V8_S5": "What is PP1V8_S5? PP1V8_S5 is a 1.8v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",

When I plugged it in the trackpad would click and the ammeter read 19.8v and 0.55A\nThe only components that looked like they had any kind of liquid damage were <CAPACITOR>C8412</CAPACITOR> , <CAPACITOR>C7660</CAPACITOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7660</TRANSISTOR>. I replaced <CAPACITOR>C7660</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C8412</CAPACITOR> and put the board in the ultrasonic.\n\nNow the board is still doing the same thing except now the amps keep going up all the way until 2.49A but still nothing on the screen. \nL7670 is showing 5v\n\nI'm not sure exactly where to start troubleshooting since the trackpad still works and gets power to it and if I measured correctly I dont think there was any voltage on <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>."
