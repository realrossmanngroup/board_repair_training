        "message":"820-3476-a\n\nA1502 Fixed blown cap and resistor and still issues.\n\nCame in no boot. Removed logic board and found C7536 blown, C7537 and R7536 looked like hell.\n\nReplaced them both, and unit had fan spin.  Reassembled unit and no boot ?\n\nOk, let's take it back apart. Power supply shows 0.09A draw.  Light goes green, then orange.  After a quick wander, again 0.09A\n\nWhat I do find odd, SSD gets warm, however no chime, no fan and CPU is cold.\n\nThoughts from here?"
