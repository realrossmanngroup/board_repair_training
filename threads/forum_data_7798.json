        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
        "PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT": "What is PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT? PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT is a 0.75v power rail present when the machine is in an S0 working state .",

All voltages are present but on L7510 and L7520 i get only 0.7v instead of 1.25. I have checked <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> its powered at pin 46 at 5V. CPUIMVP TON A and B have 12.35, <RESISTOR>R7402</RESISTOR> and 03 are 181k ohm so seems OK too. L7550 gives 0 reading. I saw in a video from Lewis that Ton A and B often fail but it seems to be working here. How should I go about to troubleshoot this?\n\nAll other voltages are OK."
