All voltages are present but on L7510 and L7520 i get only 0.7v instead of 1.25. I have checked U7400 its powered at pin 46 at 5V. CPUIMVP TON A and B have 12.35, r7402 and 03 are 181k ohm so seems OK too. L7550 gives 0 reading. I saw in a video from Lewis that Ton A and B often fail but it seems to be working here. How should I go about to troubleshoot this?\n\nAll other voltages are OK."}
