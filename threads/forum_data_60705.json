So I changed the cap, and the problem was still the same... actually my power station wasn't allowing me to put more than 1,6v, and the cap was still over heating.  I found that R5630 was the junction between  PPBUS_G3H_SSD1_SNS and PPBUS_G3H; and by removing R5630 (was corroded), I'm able to inject more than 2v on PPBUS_G3H. I don't have any piece like this one so I'm going to buy it and replace it.\n\nDo you think the problem for PPBUS_G3H shorted could come from there?"}
