        "message":"importance of checking probe points. example 820-3476 logic board. JUST hoping this will help some one in the future\n\nHi all,\n\nToday i found a issue i did not have before, and just because of a trace.\nthe trace was in perfect condition also the probe point, the brown coating was stil on the spot and also was not thicker then the rest of the board.\n\ni measured PCH_CLK32K_RTCX1 very nice 32,68MHZ on oscilloscoop\nBut i measured on the PIN 12.\n\nnothing wrong, so i continued. RABBIT HOLE and after a few hours and almost crying. i started over from scratch\n\nFrom the very start PPBUS_G3H etc.\n\nI came back again on PCH_CLK32K_RTCX1\n\nBut now i did NOT measure from PIN 12. Bbut from the probe point followed down a bit (see image)\ni scraced away the brown coating. and while i was doing that i felt the fan starting to spin!\n\ni made it more open and put on solder and wicked it clean solder again for the strengt.\n\nnow the machine runs perfect !!!!!\n\n\nso Always check the probe point. LOUIS already told this in one of his last videos and here i will say it again."
