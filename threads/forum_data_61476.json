I read on the board that q7950 was probably the problem, i changed it and after the imac was ok.\n\nI didn't used it only one day, i tried to turn him on but nothing, only led 1, i changed q7950 (q7950 not new) again and he managed to turn on, but after that, dead again, same thing, again after 1 day that i didn't used it. \n\nSince, i again changed q7950 by another one but it never turned on again. Tried even a brand new q7950 but nothing, only led 1.\n\nSo i tried to change U7950, U7870, Q7870 (all are news), U7950 have a weird voltage, Q7870 and u7870 too :\n\nU7950 :\n\nPin 1 = 12.16v\nPin 2 = 3.3v\nPin 3\/4 = 0V\nPin 5 = 12.16v\nPin 6 = 19.20v\nPin 7 = 12.16v\nPin 8 = 12.00V\n\nQ7950:\n\nPin 1, 2, 4, 8 = 12.16v\nPin 3, 5, 6 = 12.16v\n\nU7870: \n\nAll good except \npin 7 = 19.22v\npin 8 = 3.8v\n\nQ7870:\n\nAll good exept\nPin 4 = 19.22v\n\nI also noticed that U5300 have pin 6 17v.\n\nBig thanks in advance for your help."}
