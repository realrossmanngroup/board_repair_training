I read on the board that <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> was probably the problem, i changed it and after the imac was ok.\n\nI didn't used it only one day, i tried to turn him on but nothing, only led 1, i changed <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> (<TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> not new) again and he managed to turn on, but after that, dead again, same thing, again after 1 day that i didn't used it. \n\nSince, i again changed <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> by another one but it never turned on again. Tried even a brand new <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> but nothing, only led 1.\n\nSo i tried to change <CHIP>U7950</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7870</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7870</TRANSISTOR> (all are news), <CHIP>U7950</CHIP> have a weird voltage, <TRANSISTOR>Q7870</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7870</CHIP> too :\n\n<CHIP>U7950</CHIP> :\n\nPin 1 = 12.16v\nPin 2 = 3.3v\nPin 3/4 = 0V\nPin 5 = 12.16v\nPin 6 = 19.20v\nPin 7 = 12.16v\nPin 8 = 12.00V\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR>:\n\nPin 1, 2, 4, 8 = 12.16v\nPin 3, 5, 6 = 12.16v\n\n<CHIP>U7870</CHIP>: \n\nAll good except \npin 7 = 19.22v\npin 8 = 3.8v\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7870</TRANSISTOR>:\n\nAll good exept\nPin 4 = 19.22v\n\nI also noticed that <CHIP>U5300</CHIP> have pin 6 17v.\n\nBig thanks in advance for your help."
