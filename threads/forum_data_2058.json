        "message":"So I got this A1278 820-2936-B machine in a absolutely perfect condition - no scratches, no dents, no liquid spill, no sights of usage at all :)\n\nThe Costumer told me it went off by itself and never come up again - battery is charged!\n\nNow my results:\n-green light is present and stays green (battery won't charge)\n-the fan spins for a second then stops for 3 seconds and it starts again (loop)\n-with battery only the fan spins for a msecond then it goes back to S5 state and stays there until I press the power button again\n-all S5 rails are present\n-all signals for S4, S3 and S0 come up in the time the fan spins\n-SYSCLK works but I changed the chip anyway\n-all S0 Rails come up in the time the fan spins - [B][COLOR=#000000]EXCEPT [\/COLOR][\/B]PPVCORE_S0\n\nI don't know if it takes some time for PPVCORE to come up but I checked [B]U7400 [\/B]and I noticed TON pin is 12,6V and it drops almost to 0V in that moment the machine tries to go to S0.\n[B]R7402 [\/B]stays at 12,6V on pin 2 so the voltage drop is related to [B]U7400[\/B]. I own a bunch of ISL and TPS chips but no MAXes damn, also no suitable donor board!\n\nI ordered the replacement but in the meantime where I should look next? Have you any experience with this behavior?\n\n[ATTACH]2060._xfImport[\/ATTACH]"
