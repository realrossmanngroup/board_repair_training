        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "R7704": "What is R7704? a RESISTOR.",

        "C7704": "What is C7704? a CAPACITOR.",
        "EDP_BKLT_PWM": "What is EDP_BKLT_PWM? EDP_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKLT_PWM": "What is BKLT_PWM? BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKLT_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly.."

I have replaced a few components and now have normal behavior (fan-spin, image, proper rails, etc). Only issue is that backlight starts out at about 25V and slowly drops down to the non-boosted voltage as I measure it. I've tried multiple screens, and I replaced <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP>. I confirmed that the feedback line has continuity from Pin 5 on <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> to the other side of the board near <DIODE>D7701</DIODE>. Any thoughts? Thanks!"

I see now why you suggested a PRAM zap...to reset what might have been a fully lowered brightness setting.

I am curious where the issue with <SIGNAL>BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL> actually lies, at least now I can dig a bit more on my own. Thanks SO MUCH for your guidance!"
