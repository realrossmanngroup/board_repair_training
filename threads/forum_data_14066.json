Some bad keys on keyboard.\n\nI am more concerned about correcting Video flicker before worrying about Audio etc.\n\nAny Ideas? Thanks"

I also checked PP3V3, it has no detectable ripple.  Not sure if thats normal or not.\n\nNot sure if anything else I can check, or just call it bad GPU and turn it into a donor.  Any input.  Thanks"
