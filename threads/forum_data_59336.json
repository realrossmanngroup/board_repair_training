        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

        "PM_EN_P3V3_G3H": "What is PM_EN_P3V3_G3H? PM_EN_P3V3_G3H is a signal that enables the PP3V3_G3H rail to turn on. This comes out of ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip; when missing, often is missing because of a bad ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip. .",
        "SMBUS_BATT_SCL": "What is SMBUS_BATT_SCL? SMBUS_BATT_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "SMBUS_BATT_SDA": "What is SMBUS_BATT_SDA? SMBUS_BATT_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",

This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger.",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

If I go to system under power, it says that the battery is connected and charging. If I leave the power lead connected you can see the percentage going up. \n\nAt first, after measuring around the board, what seems to be missing are the <SIGNAL>SMBUS_BATT_SCL</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>SMBUS_BATT_SDA</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_L</SIGNAL>. So I thought it was the SMC, but with the SMC showing the correct information when it's in the system profile then, I've ruled this out for the time being. After more digging around I found that I was missing <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> on the battery alone. and to be more specific <SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> which comes from <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. I replaced this, but it made no difference.\n\nSo now i'm stuck, I know <SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is created by <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> but there must be something else externally that switches that on.\n\nOne last thing I have noticed with just the battery connected <SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> if fluctuating between 0.3v-0.6v, PPBUS is showing 11.45v\n\nAny pointer in the right direction"

After checking <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> and that having 11.2v I ran a wire between them both and HEY PRESTO battery now works!!!\n\nThank you for your help and support"
