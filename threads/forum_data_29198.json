J6100 was removed already. Board was clean apart from the damage trace and R6120 \/ R6121. I replaced area and ran a jumper wire. I've checked for continuity between all the termination resistors to the right of U6100 and the relevant pins. U1950 ALL_SYS_PWRGD pulses also along with SYS_PWORK_R and CPUVR_PGOOD_R .\nOn U6100 i get steadt 3.32v on pins 1,2,3 6,7,8 the only voltage jumping there is pin 5 SPI_MLB_MOSI which goes from 2.2 to 3.3v regularly."}

Check all traces, remove U6100 and resistors if necessary and then check diode mode to verify continuity to CPU and SMC."}
