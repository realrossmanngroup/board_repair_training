I replaced U1900\/Y1905 and surrounding components and now I have 1.8V on PPVCORE. However I don't get a chime or video or light on USB mouse.\nAlso I do not have a scope so I cant measure frequencies sorry. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"}

I thought it was fixed and put it in USC to get rid of flux. Then never booted again. This is when I found broken trace between C0890 to C1910. I have been checking for broken traces in the damaged area but everything seems to been out. So sorry for the confusion."}
