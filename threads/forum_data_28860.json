        "message":"Got this one in today, it had the display assembly replaced a year and a half ago at our shop with the correct display assembly and has been fine since. 2 months ago, the customer said she got a banana smashed in the ports of the logic board, and she cleaned it out with everything working. However, today she had it get lines in the screen then shut off, and she hasn't been able to make it boot since. The computer has no visible liquid damage or corrosion anywhere on the board, and the fan does spin. The computer will chime then display a white screen, however, it does nothing after that. You can't boot externally or anything tried an SMC reset, a PRAM reset, and ruled out other components in the housing. It is definitely something board level. Any idea where to start?"
