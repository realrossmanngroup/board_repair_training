I actually fixed this one but it came back for the second time now with no green light. I had to run wires around U7000 and as it came back the first time i replaced u7000 and it worked again. Now i replaced U7000 again and that fixed the green light. But now PPBUS is missing (no short). I followed this path and came to Q7085. It has 16,2-16,8V at pin 1-3 (pulsing up and down) and only aroung 7-9V at pin 5. I guess it has to do with the pulsing voltage. I checked Q7085 and when plugged in it beeps (pin 1 to pin 5) At pin 2 of R7021 i can only measure 4,7V. I checked current sensing already but the resistances are fine (3Ohm and 23Ohm). Now i don\u00b4t know where to search next and what to do to prevent it from coming back...\nThanks for any help"}

Crappy soldering\/dead chip\/another corroded trace. No way to tell, you need to check everything and all traces, possible replace U7000 again."}

I replaced the ISL again (and after that again because it was shorting a dataline for the battery so the machine could not recognize the battery) and now it works. Any idea what could kill the ISL twice? I really want to prevent it from coming back..."}

CHGR_DCIN is going up and down from 15.X to 16.X V so the ISL can not work right? I already replaced the ISL again (twice to be sure) and also Q7080 and Q7085 but no change. Still just a dimm green light (i can see it pulsing a little brighter and darker when CHGR_DCIN is going up and down) and no sign of life. Is there anything i can do with this one?"}
