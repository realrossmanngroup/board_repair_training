        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",

I actually fixed this one but it came back for the second time now with no green light. I had to run wires around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and as it came back the first time i replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and it worked again. Now i replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> again and that fixed the green light. But now PPBUS is missing (no short). I followed this path and came to <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR>. It has 16,2-16,8V at pin 1-3 (pulsing up and down) and only aroung 7-9V at pin 5. I guess it has to do with the pulsing voltage. I checked <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> and when plugged in it beeps (pin 1 to pin 5) At pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR> i can only measure 4,7V. I checked current sensing already but the resistances are fine (3Ohm and 23Ohm). Now i don´t know where to search next and what to do to prevent it from coming back...\nThanks for any help"
