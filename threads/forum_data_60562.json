When connected to a USB-C monitor, the monitor turns on but no display (indicating its drawing [I]some[\/I] power). Here are the measurements I took - do you have suggestions on where I should check next? There was a considerable amount of water residue \/ corrosion near the battery area.\n\nCPU gets luke warm (not really hot) after leaving it for 5 minutes.\n\n[U]820-00239-A[\/U]\nPPBUS_G3H - C6483 - 12.89V\nPP5VS4 - L7600 - 5.06v\nALL_SYS_PWRGD - R7103 - 3.19v\nCPU_VCCST_PWRGD- probe point - 0.98v\nPM_PCH_SYS_PWROK - probe point - 3.29v\nSMC_DELAYED_PWRGD - R5191 - 3.38v\nPPBUS_HS_CPU - C7903 - 12.03v\n[B]PPVCC_S0_CPU - 0V (resistance to ground 17 ohm, which I [I]assume [\/I]is normal)[\/B]\nPP5V_S0_VCORE1 - Pin 3 U7210 - 5.07v\n\nPP5V_S5 - probe point - 5.06v\n\nI tried reading the schematic but am lost at how PPVCC_S0_CPU is produced. I guess it could be U7210, but was hoping someone has seen something like this before.\n\nThank you! I really hope this isn't a dead CPU, as I was hoping to resurrect this as my personal laptop."}
