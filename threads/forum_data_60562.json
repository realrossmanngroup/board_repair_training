When connected to a USB-C monitor, the monitor turns on but no display (indicating its drawing [I]some[/I] power). Here are the measurements I took - do you have suggestions on where I should check next? There was a considerable amount of water residue / corrosion near the battery area.\n\nCPU gets luke warm (not really hot) after leaving it for 5 minutes.\n\n[U]<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00239</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A[/U]\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - <CAPACITOR>C6483</CAPACITOR> - 12.89V\nPP5VS4 - L7600 - 5.06v\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> - <RESISTOR>R7103</RESISTOR> - 3.19v\n<SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL>- probe point - 0.98v\n<SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL> - probe point - 3.29v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD</SIGNAL> - <RESISTOR>R5191</RESISTOR> - 3.38v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> - <CAPACITOR>C7903</CAPACITOR> - 12.03v\n[B]<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0V (resistance to ground 17 ohm, which I [I]assume [/I]is normal)[/B]\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_VCORE1</SIGNAL> - Pin 3 <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> - 5.07v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> - probe point - 5.06v\n\nI tried reading the schematic but am lost at how <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is produced.
