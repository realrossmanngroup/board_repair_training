No light on magsafe, putting out about 2v. \n\n[B]Background: [\/B]\nInitially came in for no power, liquid damaged around ISL area, as well as PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL area. \n\nReplaced ISL, cleaned up PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL area. Unit worked fine. Came back a week later, no signs of life. When plugging in an Original magsafe 2, It puts out the 2v. When I plug in my Magsafe from the DCPS, the unit boots up with no issue.\n\n[B]What I've checked\/Done:[\/B]\nR7012 has the correct measurement of 68k\nTrace from R7012 to DCIN connector is okay\nMeasurement between pin 1 and 6 at the connector are 68k\n\nReplaced DCIN connector, as it had corrosion on the pins.\n\nNot exactly sure where to go next"}
