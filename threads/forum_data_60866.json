        "R7012": "What is R7012? a RESISTOR.",
        "D7012": "What is D7012? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year model macbook airs, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. ."

No light on magsafe, putting out about 2v. \n\n[B]Background: [/B]\nInitially came in for no power, liquid damaged around ISL area, as well as <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL</SIGNAL> area. \n\nReplaced ISL, cleaned up <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL</SIGNAL> area. Unit worked fine. Came back a week later, no signs of life. When plugging in an Original magsafe 2, It puts out the 2v. When I plug in my Magsafe from the DCPS, the unit boots up with no issue.\n\n[B]What I've checked/Done:[/B]\n<RESISTOR>R7012</RESISTOR> has the correct measurement of 68k\nTrace from <RESISTOR>R7012</RESISTOR> to DCIN connector is okay\nMeasurement between pin 1 and 6 at the connector are 68k\n\nReplaced DCIN connector, as it had corrosion on the pins.\n\nNot exactly sure where to go next"
