After a NVRAM reset, the backlight displays at full brightness during the first half of the boot process, then reverts back to dim.\n\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is constant around 44 V, before and after dimming.\nBKLT_PWM is 2.5 V during full brightness, and 0.01V during dimming.\n\nI don't have another 2018 display but I tested with a 2017 display and it gave the same results. What's next to check on this board?"
