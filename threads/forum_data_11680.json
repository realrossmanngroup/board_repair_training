            "message": "Known-good test case, known-good BIL assembly/cable, battery is detected by board, charges fine, and the BIL LEDs all light up appropriately when a charger is connected, but the actual button function does not work--it does not prompt the LEDs to light up to show the charge level indication, etc. There was liquid near the SMC, and this is the only issue (it's for a board to be sold as refurbished, so we want it 100% functional). All other functions work fine. I checked a few resistors related to <SIGNAL>SMC_BIL_BUTTON_L</SIGNAL>, but they all measure out fine. Connector itself looks fine.\n\nIs there anything else I can check before reflowing/pulling the SMC to check for gunk?"

            "message": "Yeah, <RESISTOR>R5081</RESISTOR> is good. I'll check that it's pulled low in just a minute. Another thing to note (strange behavior), is that immediately after a battery is connected to the board, the BIL LED#1 flashes (the same behavior you would get if you had an almost-dead battery installed, and actually pushed the BIL). This happens even if I connect a 95%+ charged battery (so it's giving the behavior of a low-charge battery connected and the button being pressed every time a full-charged battery is connected to the board, no need to even push the button, it happens automatically). This almost makes it seem that (1) the board thinks the BIL *is* being pressed, and that (2) it thinks the attached battery is drained even when it has full charge. Again, battery is detected normally and shows proper charge percentage in OSX.\n\nLet me check <SIGNAL>BIL_BUTTON</SIGNAL> for you and get back to you."

I actually reflowed it a bit, gave it a slight tap on that corner, and I think that worked it out. BIL cable/button is working a treat now--thanks! You can mark this one as solved."
