Pulled the chip, cleaned and placed back. Same issue.\nSo I'm thinking I should replace BIOS, but I don't know how that works. I need some sort of programmer to program serial right? I use NAND programmers for iPhones but have never dealt with a BIOS programming. Also, can I use a BIOS chip from a 13 inch air instead and program that?\n\nThanks!"
