That got fixed and client used the MacBook for about 2 weeks, then it came back for no power, SMC reballed and back to working, but it only charged with chargers 60w or more.\n\nWhile working on the charging circuit I managed to fix the charging problem, but now it is boot looping, fan spins for about 1 second stops and repeats constantly. \n\nSMC bypass does the same thing but for that 1 second fan spins a little faster.\n\nAlready replaced U7100 and checked pins resistance17-18 and 27-28 both are fine.\n\nTried clean BIOS, new U6101 and everything around U1950 is clean, SPI resistors and traces are clean.\n\nRails present:\nppbus 8.56V\nppvrtc_g3h\npp5v_s5\npp3v3_s5\npp3v3_sus\n\nAfter that all S4-S3 rails are pulsing including VCORE"}
