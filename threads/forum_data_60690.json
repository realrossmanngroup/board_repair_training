        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",

That got fixed and client used the MacBook for about 2 weeks, then it came back for no power, SMC reballed and back to working, but it only charged with chargers 60w or more.\n\nWhile working on the charging circuit I managed to fix the charging problem, but now it is boot looping, fan spins for about 1 second stops and repeats constantly. \n\nSMC bypass does the same thing but for that 1 second fan spins a little faster.\n\nAlready replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and checked pins resistance17-18 and 27-28 both are fine.\n\nTried clean BIOS, new <CHIP>U6101</CHIP> and everything around <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> is clean, SPI resistors and traces are clean.\n\nRails present:\nppbus 8.56V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>\n\nAfter that all S4-S3 rails are pulsing including VCORE"
