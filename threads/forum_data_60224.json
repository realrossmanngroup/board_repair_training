        "A1708": "What is A1708? A1708 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2017, 2016 with EMC 3164, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00840, 820-00875..",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",

        "EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN? EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is necessary to enable the power rail that powers the LCD screen image circuitry. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

            "message": "I bought an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> laptop (from original owner in person) for my personal use.\n\n1) The original symptom was the screen would occasionally have a glitchy-looking screen until you move the display (indicating an issue with the flex cable).\n\n2) Took it apart and (don't ask why, I was an idiot) while it was on, I accidentally yanked the flex cable off (J8500). At this point I knew I screwed up, but upon disconnecting everything, reinstalling that connector, and turning the laptop on, the internal display was [I]no longer recognized. [/I]When I went to \"About this Mac\" with an external USB-c monitor connected, the internal display is not found.\n\n3) Incidentally, this laptop was eligible for the backlight recall, so I sent it to apple and they replaced the entire display assembly for free then returned it saying the logic board needed replacement.\n\n4) Now that the flex cable and the display have been replaced, I knew the logic board needs fixing. Below is what I tested with the laptop on, display connected, and lid open:\n\nFirst off, I checked that there is no display when shining a flashlight. I also tried a PRAM reset as part of the AppleCare return steps. I also notice the keyboard LEDs are powered on (whatever that is worth).\n\nPin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR> (<SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL>) - 13v\nPin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR> (<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_R</SIGNAL>) - 11.7v\n<SIGNAL>BKLT_SD</SIGNAL> - 11.2V\n<SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> (Pin 0 and 1 of <RESISTOR>R8442</RESISTOR>) - 0V\n            \nHow badly did I shoot myself in the foot, and did I fry the SMC? Is there any other reading I should check?"
