I replaced U1950. Pin 8 and C1950 were beat up. I cleaned up the connections a little around U1950 and now the board doesn't turn on anymore. Board had spill with damage limited to area around U1950. ALL_SYS_PWRGD is not present. PP3V3_S0 is good. 3V42 is good. I compared diode measurement in the entire U1950 area to good board and nothing is off. Any ideas where this might have gone. I'm stuck with it. Not sure what I lost."}

They all go in there if there's any sign of spill so this one's gotten the treatment. The pictures are just for reference of original state."}
