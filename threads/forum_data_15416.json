        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "C1950": "What is C1950? Capacitor between PP3V42_G3H & ground on pin 8 of U1950 on 2013-2015 Macbook Pros & Airs that often corrodes. When corroded, pin 8 on U1950 will be damaged, which will prevent machine from booting and cause PM_SLP_S4_L to pulse. .",
