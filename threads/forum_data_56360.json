            "message": "This came in as a no-spill but it looks like it was exposed to some type of very minimal moisture. Very subtle but I had to replace <RESISTOR>R3509</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R3539</RESISTOR>. Cleaned it in the ultrasonic. No change. I can't find any shorts. Every 5 or 6 seconds it will try to turn on and a small amount of current will go through for a split second. Stays at 20V the whole time. PPBUS is at 12.6V but moves between 12.59 and 12.61V which makes me think something is pulling it down slightly. Not sure where to go next."
