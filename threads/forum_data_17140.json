Reads good 3 times with same checksum so I guess it's OK since it reads. Checked the reads in UEFI tool too.\n\nEverything I get from this guy recently is either a clean shiny rabbit hole or a corroded crusty asshole resulting in wasted time. I can't see that it's been dropped but who fucking knows man.... It's going back dead.\nMy time is worth more than figuring out this problem.\n\nAppreciate the help Duke, thank you."
