The keyboards used in these two models have different designs and connectors, so they are not interchangeable. Each MacBook model has its own specific keyboard that is compatible only with that particular model. If you need to replace the keyboard on your 2015 MacBook, it is recommended to find a replacement keyboard specifically designed for that model. \"\n\nHow accurate is this answer?"}
