I decided to install a new clean image on a fresh SOC-ROM (think it is U4770 on bv) chip from a 820-00850 donor board. after i have installed it I now can restore it and the machine is running like new. You may know this but I have never tried it before and maybe it can help others.\n\nHave a great week."}
