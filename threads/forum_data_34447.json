Now around 13k.  \n\nL7630 is still close to zero ohms to ground .  L7330 is a little better at about 1k .\n\nI've prodded at most things that seem like a culprit and I'm not finding any bad caps or similar . None of the passives are getting super hot.   And I get the boot chime (no SSD so no OS . I will create a usb boot drive tomorrow).  \n\nIs this likely to be a bad <CHIP>U1800</CHIP>?  If so, I guess the board is a write off?  Or is it worth trying some heat on it?\n\nSeparately the screen connector started smoking around the backlight pins.  So I guess that wasn't as salvageable as i had originally hoped. It cleaned up nicely but probably was shorted inside. I've removed it now . The backlight pins of the cable have lost their copper but the underlying metal is still good.  The resistance to ground didn't change after removing the connector.  \n\nThe fuse went. So that's one positive!"

CPU is basically your short unless its dead.\nCPU/GPU has very low resistance between power rail and ground, this is absolutely normal. just play a little bit with the numbers: CPU eats, say, 20W. now divide it by CPU voltage, this would be your current. now divide voltage by current and this is your resistance, 10-20 ohm, yup, multimeter CT will beep, \"ahaa! we have a short here!\"... nope.\nAlso, in \"shorted circuit\" conditions you can't really test capacitors without desoldering them.\nwrong voltage does not necessarily means short circuit. maybe one phase does not work, maybe one of the CPU Power MosFETs failed, maybe one of the mosfet drivers failed, maybe CPU asks for the wrong voltage for some reason.\nbut it's all does not matter since your board chimes. brain-dead boards do not chime. board needs CPU to run the bios as well is to decode and play the audio file."
