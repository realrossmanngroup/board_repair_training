When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",

This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

Did you test with 45/60W original Magsafe 2 charger?[/U][/I]\nYes, with both of them and the result is exactly the same (green light for one second and nothing after it)\n\n[I][U]2. If yes, see what happens with fake charger, or lab PSU. [/U][/I]\nI've just check with a fake 60W magsafe 2 charger (I never use it) and the green light appeared then the orange light with the battery charging.\n\n[I][U]3. Post exact ohm value for <RESISTOR>R7012</RESISTOR> (measured onboard).[/U] [/I]\nThe exact value of <RESISTOR>R7012</RESISTOR> is 68,2 kOhm\n\n[I][U]4. Check if <DIODE>D7012</DIODE> is good[/U][/I]\nThe <DIODE>D7012</DIODE> (Diode Zener) seems to be good (0,807 V on normal flow and infinite on the opposite flow)\n\n[I][U]5.
