I noticed that pbus voltage was 1.6v at charger phase at <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, I checked my current sense resistors all seem good with normal readings 5v is at input pins of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> ac in is at normal 4v at pin 3 dc in is normal at pin 2. Checked ugate and Lgate with the oscilloscope buck controller is dead no cycling what else am i missing here? Where else can i check also no short to ground i checked for that too also <SIGNAL>SMC_REST_L</SIGNAL> is 3.3v. is that supposed to be high?\nI did replace <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> same results."

Tho it it was not the resistor was at fault but the fucking test probe point on one of the traces for <RESISTOR>R7120</RESISTOR> was completely missing ran a jumper and is now back to normal again thanks for the advice again you really know your shit."
