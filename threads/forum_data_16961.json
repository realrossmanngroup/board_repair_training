            "message": "Minimal liquid-damage on an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. Booting. There was some corrosion inside the Touch Bar cables that I was able to ultrasonic and get it to come back. The main damage was on the lid sensor. I replaced the capacitor and the pins are measuring correctly in diode mode compared to the right-side sensor. Computer works great until I close the lid. It won't come out of closed mode - the computer is convinced the lid is closed - no keys, no backlight etc. Any ideas where the breakdown might be in the circuit?"

I fluxed and reflowed it as suggested and ran a trace on top of the sensor to make sure those two components were solidly connected and it's working perfectly now. Fixed. Thanks for the tips."
