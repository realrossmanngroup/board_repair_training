Stable PPBUS at 8.16v and I get 3.42v on U6901 pin 5. I noticed SMC_BC_ACOK is swinging between 3.27 and 3.38v on pin 1\/2 which seems not OK? Any suggestions on what could cause this, or is this normal?\n\nNote there was liquid spill at L6995 area but it has stable 3.42 coming out\n\nSome more values, i assume SMC might have crap under it\n\nSMC_Adapter_EN = 0\nSMC_LID = 3.41\nSMC_RESET_L = 3.38"}

The SMC is going to tell the ISL6259 to take PPBUS_G3H from 8.1v to 8.4v when the SMC turns on. The SMC isn't turning on.\n\nIf SMC_RESET_L is 3.38v, the SMC is being told to turn on, but is not. So either the SMC is dead or there is some corrosion under it. I would give it a light reflow, if that doesn't fix replace SMC.\n\nThe spill around L6995 probably got to the PP3V42 regulator as well and caused it to send a spike of 8 or 16v to the SMC, which could've killed it."}
