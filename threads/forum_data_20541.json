        "820-3208": "What is 820-3208? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U6901": "What is U6901? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. ."

I noticed <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is swinging between 3.27 and 3.38v on pin 1/2 which seems not OK? Any suggestions on what could cause this, or is this normal?\n\nNote there was liquid spill at L6995 area but it has stable 3.42 coming out\n\nSome more values, i assume SMC might have crap under it\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER_EN</SIGNAL> = 0\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> = 3.41\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> = 3.38"

The SMC is going to tell the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> to take <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> from 8.1v to 8.4v when the SMC turns on. The SMC isn't turning on.\n\nIf <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is 3.38v, the SMC is being told to turn on, but is not. So either the SMC is dead or there is some corrosion under it. I would give it a light reflow, if that doesn't fix replace SMC.\n\nThe spill around L6995 probably got to the PP3V42 regulator as well and caused it to send a spike of 8 or 16v to the SMC, which could've killed it."
