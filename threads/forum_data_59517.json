        "message":"Hi I have a question let\u2019s say I have to remove a gpu and replace it . I have a quick station and do it by hand. Is it worth getting a bga rework station. I\u2019ve done 3 Gpu in various boards so far and well it\u2019s a little nerve racking. I was gonna attempt a mux replacement on but I\u2019m not sure I can pull this of with the station I have now. Since the area is so densely populated.  I\u2019ve never Tried. What are the advantages of own a bga station if any. I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the place for this in the forum as I don\u2019t know where it should go.\nthank you"

It\u2019s getting Burning hot so I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s internally shorted. I\u2019ll pull and if it isn\u2019t I\u2019ll re-ball it. I\u2019m also stuck on a short in this board. :("
