            "message": "Hi I have a question let’s say I have to remove a gpu and replace it . I have a quick station and do it by hand. Is it worth getting a bga rework station. I’ve done 3 Gpu in various boards so far and well it’s a little nerve racking. I was gonna attempt a mux replacement on but I’m not sure I can pull this of with the station I have now. Since the area is so densely populated.  I’ve never Tried. What are the advantages of own a bga station if any. I’m sorry if this isn’t the place for this in the forum as I don’t know where it should go.\nthank you"
