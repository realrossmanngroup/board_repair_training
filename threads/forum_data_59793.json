Didn’t poke around much while connected to power to have shorted anything.\n\n On other charger circuits I’ve seen ~16V before on pin 1 occasionally does that usually imply bad isl? also Does the isl produce the voltage at 19,20 and 27? Obviously I struggle to understand schematics. I have difficulty at time identifying what are inputs vs outputs unless it specifically says right on the pin of chip in schematic"
