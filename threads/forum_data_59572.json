        "message":"Hi,\n\nI have a spotless board which won't turn on.\nI assume those board should not need a battery to give me CPU_Vcore as the A1707 do, am I correct?\nI am expecting to get around 1amp with the bear board and then down to 0, even with no screen, no battery.\n\nThe board goes from 5V to 20V (draws .25A during the process) and then draws 0.17A for a second or 2, then 0.2A for another second and down to 0A where it stays.\nIs there a possibility that this board needs a T2 Firmware update?\n\nPPBus_G3H is a nice 12.6V.\n\nThanks!"
