I got an orange light and it was charging for a couple of minutes then all of a sudden the mouse moved very laggy and the orange light went off. ISL6259 is now getting very hot when the power is plugged in. Also, it appears my charger died during all this. I have another though. Any particular readings you want me to take at this point, bearing in mind that ISL6259 is getting very hot very quickly?"}
