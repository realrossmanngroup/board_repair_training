Is there any way of charging an A1706 MacBook Pro battery using a bench PSU? I ask because I have one here that got over discharged and is giving only 2.5V and is not charging with original charger. I want to try to revive it. I do this with iPhone batteries just by putting 5V on PSU and attaching it to both poles of the battery, but the MacBook battery does not take power from PSU, I think it may need some activation voltage to start charging."}
