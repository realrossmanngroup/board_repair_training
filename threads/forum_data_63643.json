    "definitions": {
        "A1708": "What is A1708? A1708 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2017, 2016 with EMC 3164, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00840, 820-00875..",
        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "D6950": "What is D6950? a DIODE.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U7800": "What is U7800? a CHIP.",
        "U6990": "What is U6990? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H? This is the input from the USB-C charger or the battery that is the input voltage for the chip responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H. It can be missing when capacitors on this line are shorted to ground, or when the diode in front of it leading to the chip that creates PP3V3_G3H is blown. .",
        "PM_EN_P3V3_G3H": "What is PM_EN_P3V3_G3H? PM_EN_P3V3_G3H is a signal that enables the PP3V3_G3H rail to turn on. This comes out of ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip; when missing, often is missing because of a bad ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip. .",
        "PP5V_LDO5V": "What is PP5V_LDO5V? a SIGNAL.",

        "C6990": "What is C6990? Capacitor to ground on input to PP3V42_G3H power supply. PP3V42_G3H power supply turns 18.5v from charger or 8.5v-12.5v PPBUS_G3H from the battery into PP3V42_G3H. This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger.",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "D6905": "What is D6905? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input on very old Macbooks(before 2011), can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",
        "TPS51980": "What is TPS51980? This is a power chip responsible for the PP3V3_S5,  PP5V_S5,  and PP5V_S3 power rails on many A1286 Macbook Pros,  A1297 Macbook Pros,  A1369 Macbook Airs,  A1466 Macbook Airs,  A1370 Macbook Airs,  and A1465 Macbook Airs.",

Diode mode was showing 0.340 very similar to other working boards however resistance to ground was reading 1.9KOhm.\nThis was pointing to a 2kohms resistance with other end shorted to ground, indeed I found <RESISTOR>R5381</RESISTOR>-pin2 <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3H_SCL</SIGNAL> full shorted to ground. Turned out to be <DIODE>D6950</DIODE> shorting the signal.\n\n3)<SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3H_SCL</SIGNAL> was still reading a low short this time 0.041 in diode mode, additionnaly <SIGNAL>PP5V_LDO5V</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground, this time it turned out to be <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> PMIC witch I replaced.\n\nNow on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> I have normal readings compare to other boards 0.340 in diode mode and 21kOhm to ground\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_LDO5V</SIGNAL> is also 0,425 diode mode\n\nMy issue: I still have 2.29V on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>.\nIf I remove <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> I can see <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> outputing 3.4V If I put back <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> it is pulled down to 2,29V. <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> measures fine 0 ohm.\nIf I inject 3,4V on system side I have 14mA draw exactly same with working board.\n\nCan I assume <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> are ok since I get  3,4V on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> when <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> is removed? Or I am wrong as I perhaps get 3,4V only because there is no load?\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is 4,8V and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 30mV with no short at all.\n\nI am out of idea and thats why I am here!\nThanks"
