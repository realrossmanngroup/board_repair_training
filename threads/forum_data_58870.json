Laptop works fine from battery power\n\nI already went through a schematic and found R5311 to be only 67k but seems suspect as if the schematic is wrong(going to order. What should I be looking at next?\n\nUPDATE: [B]photos added and U7000 gets very hot its a bit small for me to resolder, any other causes for this? [\/B]Forgot to mention I have a CMIzapper gpukilller fitted for sometime working fine."

Q7035 has probably worn with it at same time according to what I've read.  \nR7051 and R7052 are measuring at 15.5 ohms and 0.5 as oppose to 2.2 and 0 so ordered replacements. \nI've had to order Q7030 (K0332) and Q7035 (K0305) from china Aliexpress as couldnt find a UK source so likely going to be June\/July when I install these."
