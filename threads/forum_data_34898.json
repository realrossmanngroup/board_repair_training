        "PP3V3_S0SW_LCD": "What is PP3V3_S0SW_LCD? PP3V3_S0SW_LCD is a 3.3v power rail necessary to power the image circuitry on the screen. This is necessary to get a picture on the screen. .",
        "EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN? EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is necessary to enable the power rail that powers the LCD screen image circuitry. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

        "HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT": "What is HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT? HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT is a signal from the hall sensor on the RIGHT side of the machine that indicates that the lid has been closed. This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen.",
