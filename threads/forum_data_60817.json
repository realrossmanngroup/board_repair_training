        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_SLP_S0_L": "What is PM_SLP_S0_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "EDP_PANEL_PWR": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_S0_PGOOD": "What is PM_S0_PGOOD?  PM_S0_PGOOD is created when CPUVR_PGOOD and ALL_SYS_PWRGD are present and branches off to become PM_PCH_PWROK. PM_S0_PGOOD and SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD are necessary to create SYS_PWROK_R and PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK .",
        "SYS_PWROK_R": "What is SYS_PWROK_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "CPUVR_PGOOD_R": "What is CPUVR_PGOOD_R? CPUVR_PGOOD_R is a signal that comes from CPU_VR_EN that is necessary along with ALL_SYS_PWRGD to create PM_S0_PGOOD.",

        "PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_UF": "What is PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_UF? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_DELAYED": "What is SMC_DELAYED? SMC_DELAYED Is an abbreviation of SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD which is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a pre-requisite for SYS_PWROK_R and PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK..",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. ."

I paid attention to the CPU pcb mostly, kept away from the CPU die itself but did hit the pch die area after i felt like the sides were good not for too long mind.  It boots, but is missing backlight.  I'll fix that in a jif.\n\nI LOVE YOU 2INFORMATICOS, YOU ARE 2GOOD 2US."
