The computer powers on and passes Apple built in diags. The computer will load up and about 80% through the loading progress bar then the screen goes black and reboots. The heatsink gets incredibly hot when running for only about a minute. I can get the computer to run at a \"normal\" temperature with the the trackpad disconnected. I have tried connecting a known good trackpad to the board and it still runs hot. I watched Louis' video on the 00138 that was failing to load an OS due to corrosion but all three of the buck controller ICs look to be in good condition. No corrosion, burns, etc.\n\nPPBUS: 12.54V\nPPVRTC: 3.332V\nPPVCC: 1.804V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_GFX</SIGNAL>: 0.85V\n\nThis is the only remotely questionable buck controller IC, there is a small semi-circle mark on one of the ICs.
