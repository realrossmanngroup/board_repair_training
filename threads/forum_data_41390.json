SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this lineâ€™s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",

The damage is minor and directly was found on <RESISTOR>R5381</RESISTOR>. <SIGNAL>G3_POWERON_L</SIGNAL> pad was burnt off the board as well. i have so far ran a wire from <SIGNAL>G3_POWERON_L</SIGNAL> to its test point next to <RESISTOR>R5172</RESISTOR>. <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL</SIGNAL> is fluctuating from 3.42 - 3.20V. Replaced <RESISTOR>R5381</RESISTOR> and reballed the original SMC and ISL. Diode mode on SMBUS is .510 and Diode on <SIGNAL>G3_POWERON_L</SIGNAL> is .728. Fans are still high with no other signs of liquid. Should I try another SMC? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!"
