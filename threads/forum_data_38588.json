But it is bit weird as THE GPU stress  test passed and GPU is not getting hot and crash is screen runs weird scramble shapes and fan spinning full speed from the start.\n\nTime to time no chime or video. I replaced the GPU but the same situation. \n\nNow only 2 times out of 10 it starts with high speed fan. other times high speed fan spinning and no <SIGNAL>PPIV05_SO</SIGNAL>.\n\nPIN 14, 13 I GET 5V\n<RESISTOR>R7981</RESISTOR> not getting <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_R_L</SIGNAL> coz no connectivity. so I ran a wire and now I get <SIGNAL>CPUVCCIO_SO_EN</SIGNAL> 3.3V on pin 3.\n\nmissing CPU_VCCIOSENSE_P and  CPU_VCCIOSENSE_N in <RESISTOR>R1362</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1363</RESISTOR>.\n\n\nGreatly appreciate your support.\n\n\nRegards\n\nDon"
