Came as GPU crashing. But it is bit weird as THE GPU stress  test passed and GPU is not getting hot and crash is screen runs weird scramble shapes and fan spinning full speed from the start.\n\nTime to time no chime or video. I replaced the GPU but the same situation. \n\nNow only 2 times out of 10 it starts with high speed fan. other times high speed fan spinning and no PPIV05_SO.\n\nPIN 14, 13 I GET 5V\nR7981 not getting PM_SLP_S3_R_L coz no connectivity. so I ran a wire and now I get CPUVCCIO_SO_EN 3.3V on pin 3.\n\nmissing CPU_VCCIOSENSE_P and  CPU_VCCIOSENSE_N in R1362, R1363.\n\n\nGreatly appreciate your support.\n\n\nRegards\n\nDon"}

Bad CPU or bad traces in the board around the GPU. I bet this is an Apple refurb board with no serial number on the RAM slot."}

I think you are right. I'll replace the CPU and see. I couldnt find SR02R chip or Stencil. Anyway I'll update you soon. Thanks Duke."}
