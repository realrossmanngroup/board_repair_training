The device suddenly powers off after using it for somewhere between 10 to 40 minutes.\nHaving a high load running on it won't charge the issues (Furmark + Prime95 for 20 minutes would not cause the device to shutdown) but just idle running a youtube video made it crash at one point.\nThe power off is not registered by the system as a kernel panic and does not show signs of the keyboard incorrectly pressing the power button. (The Shutdown window does not appear, as it would when the power button is being held down). The system does not reboot after the power off has occurred but would stay in S5\n\nIs this model also affected by bad soldering? If so what chip would be the cause of this?\nAny idea where to look?\n\nCheers!"}
