After cleaning the board in the ultrasonic cleaner, the rest of the board looks OK. It's missing <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL>. I'm testing using an original Apple 87W USB type C charger and cable from Apple. Here are the readings I have so far:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 13V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 5V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> = 0V  31K to gnd on that line\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> = 3.4V\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> = 0V\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> = 0V\n\nAny and all advice welcome :)\n\nCheers,\n\nAlex"
