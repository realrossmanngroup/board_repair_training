I'm at a loss with this one.\n\nThe Fluke multimeter is able to measure frequency. <SIGNAL>SYSCLK_CLK25M_SB</SIGNAL> measures 0 Hz[/QUOTE]no\n\nwell,  all the fluctuation you see is a sign of boot loop, your main problem. the common techniques are to try good-known BIOS, check for the shorts on all peripheral chips (like audio IC), try to start it in SMC bypass mode, and so on. If you see that board starts till the FAN spin, it is already enough to say that the higher logical level is present, this is not the chime but still it shuts down with the reset signal released by one of the main ICs which would not happen with the dead clock. MM Frequency meter is not something you could use to test clock chip, it is used primarily for mains in sub-Khz range. To check if BIOS is being actually read, you can use a LED (in series with ~100Ohm Resistance, of course!). Just connect it between ground and Data line on your bios chip, it will blink slow enough to see if you're getting any activity.\n\nYour question about current measuring and voltage change on clock chip shows that you might need some more theory. For example, if you're measuring \"Current\" by putting probes between ground and any point of the circuit, you're simply destroying the board since current measuring works only in series and your multimeter's resistance is close to zero in this mode. If done properly, it does not affect the circuit, if wrong - sure it burns the shit out of your board :)"
