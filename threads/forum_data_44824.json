The only way it will switch is if I insert the headphones, then close the lid so that the computer\ngoes to sleep, then open the lid to wake it out of sleep. Once it comes out of sleep the output goes from internal speaker to headphones.\n\nThis is a very odd problem and I have tried with several Operating systems.\n\nAnyone seen this before?\n\nThanks and have a good one.\n\n\n\nTotally forgot that the port is on the IO board. Probably just that or the cable. SMH."}
