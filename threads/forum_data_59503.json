        "A1425": "What is A1425? A1425 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Early 2013, Late 2012 with EMC 2672, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3190, 820-3462..",
        "820-3462A": "What is 820-3462A? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "AVREF_SMC": "What is AVREF_SMC? AVREF_SMC is a reference voltage provided to the SMC so that its sensors have a reference to work from, this should be 3.3v.",
        "1V2_S5": "What is 1V2_S5? a SIGNAL.",
        "R4902": "What is R4902? a RESISTOR."

Well I finally tracked one down an replaced it. Board still won't work though. It does have the orange light (so 3V42 definitely working) and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is normal. Any suggesting? Which rails should I post?"
