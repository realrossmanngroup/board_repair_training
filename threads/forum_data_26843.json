The only noticeable thing that doesn't function properly is the power button. if pressed when the laptops on, it instantly restarts. When off it doesn't turn the machine on, you have to unplug the battery, plug in a charger and then hotplug the battery. \n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is good.\nI have replaced the SMC with no change.\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> has 3v42 on it\nKeyboard tested. \n\nIve figured its not doing a full SMC reset when the power buttons pressed either, SMC reset circuitry has been ruled out. The only thing i can see as obvius damage is long screw damage into the board where the Fan screws in (on the webcam connector side of the board."

Do They naturally run hot?\n\ngobsmaked that replacing those fets restored my power button though, Good work!"
