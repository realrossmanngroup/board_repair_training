            "message": "Arrived with no liquid damage. Has a strange charging issue where it will run off a/c and charge battery the first few minutes its running but afterwards  it will either stop charging the battery and run off a/c adapter for a few minutes or stop charging the battery plus act like a/c adapter is not plugged in and only run off of battery. USB amp meter shows 20V at 0 amps when this occurs.\n\nBattery shows normal condition 180 cycles.\n\nAny ideas on this one?"
