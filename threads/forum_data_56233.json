In one repair I did the cable connector looked perfect but it was shorted on the inside of the LCD, remove the plastic cover on the LCD lid, remove the bad cable, clean the connector on the LCD lid, inspect it with the microscope and clean well, put new cable and check diode mode on pin 1 again, if there is no short also check for continuity back to the connector to make sure you are good, replace fuse and done!"}
