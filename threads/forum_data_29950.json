Found short on <CHIP>U7541</CHIP>. Removed and replaced <CHIP>U7541</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7100</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7730</CHIP> along with surrounding components. Resistance to ground on Vcore is now 1.1 Ohms. Also, I do not have a green/amber light on charger even though it seems I have PP3V42 on multiple TP's. Here are some measurements.\n\nPPBUS - 12.57V\nPP3v42 - 3.414V\nPPDCIN - 14.77V\nPPVRTC - 3.343V\n<SIGNAL>SYS_ONE</SIGNAL> - 3.32 - 3.412V (Fluctuates)\n<SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> - 16.07V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER</SIGNAL> _EN - 3.373V\nACOK - 2.59V - 3.1V (Fluctuates)\n\nWondering why no green light.\n\nGenuine charger, known working magsafe. \n\nThanks, Have a good day."
