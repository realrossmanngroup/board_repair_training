        "message":"Hello\n820-3332 liquid damage around Q7100, U7541 and U7730. CPU_VCore was shorted to 0 Ohms resistance to ground. Found short on U7541. Removed and replaced U7541, Q7100 and U7730 along with surrounding components. Resistance to ground on Vcore is now 1.1 Ohms. Also, I do not have a green\/amber light on charger even though it seems I have PP3V42 on multiple TP's. Here are some measurements.\n\nPPBUS - 12.57V\nPP3v42 - 3.414V\nPPDCIN - 14.77V\nPPVRTC - 3.343V\nSYS_ONE - 3.32 - 3.412V (Fluctuates)\nAdapter_Sense - 16.07V\nSMC_Adapter _EN - 3.373V\nACOK - 2.59V - 3.1V (Fluctuates)\n\nWondering why no green light.\n\nGenuine charger, known working magsafe. \n\nThanks, Have a good day."
