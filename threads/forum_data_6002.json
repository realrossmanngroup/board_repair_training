Super close to completion but of course I'm stuck somewhere. \nLaptop was sold not booting liquid damaged as is. I have it booting again and when connected to charger it now works perfect however it will not see any battery. Whether it be new or taken from another working laptop it will not see the battery. Orange and green lights are now present on charger.\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> has the 8.6v on pins 1,2 and 3.\nPin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C6951</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C6950</CAPACITOR> don't seem to have <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CONN</SIGNAL> and I can't for the life of me figure out why. \nPlease advise. Thanks a lot!"
