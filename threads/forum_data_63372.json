The initial problem was Q7706, I replaced it and got all voltages but no backlight I had output on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT. the output voltages are coming and going as they like :) SCL and SDA lines are almost 5v and diode mode is good on all components. I checked all resistors and they are measuring good values. I also replaced Q7701. Ideas?"}
