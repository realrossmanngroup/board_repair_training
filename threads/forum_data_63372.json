        "A1398": "What is A1398? A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",
        "820-3787": "What is 820-3787? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "Q7701": "What is Q7701? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "PPBUS_SW_BKL": "What is PPBUS_SW_BKL? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD": "What is PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW": "What is PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW? PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW is a line after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit for backlight that connects to the LED driver’s switch(SW) pin where it is switched to ground rapidly in order to create the boosted voltage for the backlight circuit. .",
        "BKL_SW": "What is BKL_SW? BKL_SW means “BACKLIGHT SWITCH” – DC to DC boost circuits increase voltage by putting a lower voltage, like 8 volts, through an inductor. On the other side of the inductor, it is switched to ground rapidly - on this side, you will end up with an increased voltage as a result of the switching. BKL_SW usually refers to the pin on the LED driver that is attached to the inductor. .",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "R7780": "What is R7780? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. ."
