Replaced them and also removed and replaced shorted C7034. Now computer works fine.except of one of ports.  It is U3100 Port getting 5V and 0 AMPS. Alreday tried to replace it from donor board but no changes.\n\nOn U3100 is missing  PP3V3_G3H_RTC (not shorted)\n\nP.S:  PP1V1_IPC_XA_LDO_BMC also missing"}
