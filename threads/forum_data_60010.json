ISL 6259 was replaced and battery current sensing was repaired. Overall, damage was minimal. It now passes ASD EFI without issue and runs well. Only hardware that has been changed is HDD has been replaced by non-Apple SSD. \n\nSometimes, when the machine is allowed to idle for about 30 minutes, it will not wake up from sleep. It becomes completely unresponsive to normal inputs from the keyboard (including power button) and mouse. What always fixes the problem is to do an SMC reset (left shift + left option + control + power button). The machine runs completely fine other than this one problem. \n\nWhat could be causing this?"}
