How are you doing this without scratching the display itself. I puled a good LCD out of its housing without damaging it in order to throw it into a display with functional backlight. Got it in some how and misinterpreted Duke's instruction to re use original glue, clamp it and wait. Got to the last edge portion and good night nurse. \n\nI layed kapton tape around the border to negate cosmetic damage to the display.. What's the trick?"
