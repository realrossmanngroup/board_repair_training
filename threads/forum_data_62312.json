    "definitions": {
        "820-3209": "What is 820-3209? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PP3V3_S5_REG": "What is PP3V3_S5_REG? PP3V3_S5_REG is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. .",
        "PP5V_S3_REG": "What is PP5V_S3_REG? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V42_G3H_REG": "What is PP3V42_G3H_REG? PP3V42_G3H_REG is another way to say PP3V42_G3H. PP3V42_G3H_REG and PP3V42_G3H are a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPVCORE_S0_AXG_REG": "What is PPVCORE_S0_AXG_REG? PPVCORE_S0_AXG_REG Is a single phase of CPU VCORE for the graphics processor integrated into the CPU before it is combined into one PPVCORE_S0_AXG rail.",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU_PH1": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU_PH1? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_REG_R": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_REG_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "PDDR_S3_REG": "What is PDDR_S3_REG? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q7950": "What is Q7950? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "CPUIMVP_VR_ON": "What is CPUIMVP_VR_ON? CPUIMVP_VR_ON is a signal that tells the buck converter responsible for PPVCORE_S0_CPU to turn on and create CPU vcore voltage. This comes from ALL_SYS_PWRGD – once ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present, CPUIMVP_VR_ON will be present. .",
        "P5V_S0_CPUIMVP_VDD": "What is P5V_S0_CPUIMVP_VDD? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."
