This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. ."

I had exact same computer, 17\" 2011 2.2 model.\nI put the working next to the one that was not turning on, \n\nThe fake CHARGER ON EXACT SAME MACBOOK AS my friend , MY MACBOOK made some NOISE and then the LCD Display BLEW OUT old fashion with a WARP. \nNOW, BOTH MACBOOKS DO RECEIVE POWER (GREEN LIGHT).\n\nI DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I USED THE CHARGER IN THE FIRST PLACE.  :/\n\nI have a DC Power Supply where I had cut the end of a MacBook Pro charger and split the positive and negative sides. \n\nWhat would be step one?\nHow do I test the rails using the schematics to see which component went bad.\n\nnever done this repair before. \n\nNeed guidance. Thanks"

            "message": "First of all, welcome to the forum!\n\nOriginal Apple charger is smart enough (has an embedded processor).\nIt only delivers 6V (for Magsafe 1), with low current capability.\nOnce charger correctly detects the MacBook, it will switch to full voltage/power.\n\nFake chargers deliver full voltage from the first moment.\nSometime SMC gets fried; especially if Magsafe is connected bit angled.\n\nThat shouldn't be your problem if the machine worked a bit.\nBut some fake chargers also generate unstable voltage, with lot of spikes.\nYou could have the \"chance\" to got one.\n\n\" BOTH MACBOOKS DO RECEIVE POWER (GREEN LIGHT) \"\nThis means <SIGNAL>3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is present and SMC works (at least partially).\nBut we need more information.\nDo the fans spin?\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> appears with correct voltage (when battery disconnected)?\n\nIf you plan to use lab PSU to power the machine, turn it on (PSU) only after the cable is connected to MacBook."
