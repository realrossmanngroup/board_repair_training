        "message":"First time working on a USB-C board...\n\nLiquid hit U8210 and U3200.  No visible corrosion, just sticky mess.  The rest of the board looks flawless.\n\nCleaned up U8210 and verified PP3v3_S4 and PP5v_S0 are being output.\n\nFlowed flux at low temp and ultrasonic cleaned to attempt to remove anything under U3200.\n\nUpon inserting USB-C (either port) it takes 20.4v and 0.65A and fans start but screen remains off.\n\nThe amps slowly climb from 0.65A to 2.95A and after about 45 - 50 seconds the screen will come on.\n\nWith customer's SSD installed I get flashing ? folder once machine turns on.  SSD is warm (borderline hot).  Zero liquid damage in the area of SSD though.  Unfortunately I don't have another A1708 on hand or another one of these SSDs...\n\nI attempted to boot from a known good test drive over USB.  It will give Apple logo, no loading bar, and gets stuck forever.\n\nI also attempted to boot from two newly created USB installers.  They also give Apple logo, progress bar starts, then machine reboots...\n\nLastly I tried diagnostic\/internet recovery.  It shows that there are no available wifi network.  \n\nIt is possible corrosion under U3200 would cause all of this?  I have a new on on the way just in case."
