Someone reflowed or reball GPU. Its looking like generic GPU problem so replaced chip (216-0810005) now LCD backlight is ok but no picture. (LCD back round is black like new macbook s boot screen ) replaced 4 times chip but all time same issue ( also have different data code chips 16 and 12 ) now i think different problem now stopped my brain:( Any idea?\n\n- USB mouse light is not up but i cant be sure its must be this model?  \n- Chime ok,\n- Tried known good LCD and data cables.\n- PP3V3_SW_LCD voltage is ok. \n\nThanks."}
