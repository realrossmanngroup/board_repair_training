No liquid damage, no visible damage. Sent to me, orange light, no boot. Opened it up, no fan, tested no 5v_s0. 3v3_s5 present. Any ideas. Tried a monkey see monkey do at u7200 and changed it. No s0 at pin 16, ppvin_s0_cpuvr_vin=8.56v. There looked to be some discoloration around the chip, so that's what prompted me to switch it out. No such luck. Ideas?"}

No shorts on circuit. Struggling to determine, why it isn't coming from the connector in the first place. Is it because of IO board (unlikely) or is it because of another component up stream?"}
