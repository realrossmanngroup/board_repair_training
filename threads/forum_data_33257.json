PPBUS_G3H measures a fluctuating 3.9 - 4.1v, removed F7140 and PPVBAT_G3H_CHRG_REG measures the same fluctuation.\n\nChanged U7100 numerous times, Q7130 and a bunch of resistors and caps that looked bad\/measured out of spec.\n\nU7100 readings:\nPin 19 - 5.5v\nPin 20 - 5.5v schematics say 5.1v here for pin 19 and 20\nPin 2 - 16.45v CHRG_DCIN\nPin 12 - 3.4v\nPin 3 - 4v\nPin 1 - 0v CHRG_AGATE at R7186 pin 1 measures 6.78v\n\nI'm stuck, is the 5.5v at Pin 19\/20 something to be concerned about as schematics say 5.1v\nWhy is R7186 got 6.78v at one side and not the other? It's a resistor which has been changed and measures 326k instead of 332k\nWhat typically causes a voltage to fluctuate like that?\n\nThanks for the help"}
