        "R7022": "What is R7022? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

Machine was liquid damaged around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <CHIP>U6903</CHIP>, j6951, <CAPACITOR>C4914</CAPACITOR> area.\nreplace both IC's and clean board those places J6951 ad <CAPACITOR>C4914</CAPACITOR> they are looks ok after cleaning . \nLaptop now is trying to boot chasing voltage from 5v to 20 I can see it is draining current showing apple logo and cut off showing than 20V and 0.00A without battery. \nWith battery and charger is looping on apple logo. \nL9601 I am getting 3v3 measured resistance on this line ( 67ohm ) to the ground \n<CAPACITOR>C7080</CAPACITOR> 1.8V \n<RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR> 20.12V\n<RESISTOR>R7061</RESISTOR> 12.64V\nCoils around CPU I am getting only voltage on L8102 0.95V dropping to 0V once the loop sequence is over.\nAny idea on this ? \nThanks"
