        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "U7200": "What is U7200? a CHIP.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "CPU_VR_EN": "What is CPU_VR_EN? CPU_VR_EN is an enable signal for CPU VCORE that is present when it is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. ALL_SYS_PWRGD, PM_RSMRST_L, PM_SLP_SUS_L, and PM_SLP_S3_L are necessary prerequisites for CPU_VR_EN to be present. .",
        "R7520": "What is R7520? a RESISTOR.",
        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS? This power rail is PPBUS_G3H after going through a current sense resistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H & the input of PPBUS_G3H to circuitry that provides power for the CPU.."

Machine came my desk doesn't turn on and not fan spining, when i check board too little corrosion around <RESISTOR>R7520</RESISTOR> . after cleaned fan turns on but not chine and nothing screen. When checked voltage\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> = 0 v\n<SIGNAL>CPU_VR_EN</SIGNAL> = 0.99 v\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> = 3.3 v\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.3 V\n\nother 8v,5v and 3.3v is ok.\n\nReplaced SPI,<CHIP>U7501</CHIP>,<CHIP>U7200</CHIP> nothing changed\n\nWhere can i start to check\nThanks"
