The charger has a green light.\nWithout the battery I have no fan spin but still a green light in the charger\nI tried a different charger but nothing. The DC in port looks ok, there is power coming through.\nI have measured the following S5 rails and they are all present.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP0V9_S5</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>\n\nI’m not sure where to go from here, can you help?"
