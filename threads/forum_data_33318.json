The charger has a green light.\nWithout the battery I have no fan spin but still a green light in the charger\nI tried a different charger but nothing. The DC in port looks ok, there is power coming through.\nI have measured the following S5 rails and they are all present.\nPPBUS_G3H\nPP3V42_G3H\nPP3V3_S5\nPP0V9_S5\nPP5V_S5\n\nI\u2019m not sure where to go from here, can you help?"}

At this point you do not know if the charger is recognized really. Unless you can confirm the light will turn orange with a battery connected."}
