When the lid is closed for a short while you hear the chime and it reboots and either comes back on or stays off. Then power button to get going again. Sometimes I have to do another smc reset because it comes on with no backlight. This doesn't worry me however because it only happens when the first problem happens. \n\nI have swapped I\/o board and trackpad. Smc_lid is 3.4v when open and 0 when closed. I have changed r5171 as well. \nTotally stuck as to why when closing lid it decides to restart. So thanks in advance for the time spent helping."}
