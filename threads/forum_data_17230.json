            "message": "Looking for help here.\nWorks perfect until lid gets closed upon which I guess an smc reset keeps happening. When the lid is closed for a short while you hear the chime and it reboots and either comes back on or stays off. Then power button to get going again. Sometimes I have to do another smc reset because it comes on with no backlight. This doesn't worry me however because it only happens when the first problem happens. \n\nI have swapped I/o board and trackpad. <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.4v when open and 0 when closed. I have changed <RESISTOR>R5171</RESISTOR> as well. \nTotally stuck as to why when closing lid it decides to restart. So thanks in advance for the time spent helping."
