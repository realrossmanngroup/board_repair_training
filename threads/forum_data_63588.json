        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

He said that the laptop was always and only serviced by Apple Store. It appears that they already replaced the screen and the motherboard :LOL:))))\n\nWhen I opened it I was shocked : several screws were missing and others were all over the board. One screw was stuck between pin 1 and 2 of the <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C8036</CAPACITOR> was destroyed !! (pics attached)\n\n[B]MEASUREMENTS :[/B]\nI pulled the board out and replaced <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C8036</CAPACITOR> and was getting 20V and the apms were getting up to 0.70 and resetting to 0.05, basically looping.\n\nI started to do some measurement around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> (<CAPACITOR>C7078</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7020</CAPACITOR>) and suddenly (I might have short-circuited smth) i'm getting only 5V at 0.05A\n\nOther measurement I did\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_LDO5V</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 0v \n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDO</SIGNAL> - 1.79V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC</SIGNAL> - 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD</SIGNAL> - 1.79V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_UPC_XA_LDO</SIGNAL> - 1.79V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC</SIGNAL> - 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOD</SIGNAL> - 1.79V\n\n<CAPACITOR>C7078</CAPACITOR> - 5V\n<DIODE>D6905</DIODE> - pin1 - 0V, pin2 - 5V, pin3 - 5;V\n\nThank you for all your support\n\nBest regards"
