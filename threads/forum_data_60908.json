Fixed the short on ppbus which was preventing it from turning on, it switches on now and works on external display but nothing on the internal screen. The LCD connector is clean and no sign of liquid there however Pin 3 DP_INT_AUXCH_C_P on J8500 is reading 8ohms to ground in resistance mode and 0.0002 in diode mode. Getting the same readings if I pull R8502. Pin 2 reads normal 0.290 in diode mode. \n\nJust wanted to check because I think this means cpu itself is internally broken and is not fixable?"}
