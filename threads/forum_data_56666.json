        "820-00281": "What is 820-00281? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "SMC_ON_OFF_L": "What is SMC_ON_OFF_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP5V5_S4": "What is PP5V5_S4? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

Have taken it in and board looks very clean but is exhibiting the following behaviour:\n\nWith battery plugged in i'm not getting PPBUS generated and my charger isn't able to power the machine - my usb c ammeter just keeps cycling on and off. With the battery unplugged I am getting PPBUS voltage at 12.6V and correct negotiation of the charging voltage from the charger. The board however still won't power up i've checked some common voltages:\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> - present\nPPBUS - present 12.6v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ON_OFF_L</SIGNAL> sits at 3.3v but does drop to 0v when power button pressed. \n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> sits at 3.3v when lid open and drops to 0v when lid closed\n\nWhen I initally connect my charger / usb c ammeter to the board when it's bare after negotiating the correct charger voltage I get a brief current surge to 1.5a then it drops down to 0.0a and stays there. \n\nI haven't delved to much further into this one yet however would appreciate any advice in where to look first or if there is any common issue with the behavior I have described!"
