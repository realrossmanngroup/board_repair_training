        "message":"So my second 820-00281 in as many weeks. Customer advises they were watching youtube when it just shut down no power. Have taken it in and board looks very clean but is exhibiting the following behaviour:\n\nWith battery plugged in i'm not getting PPBUS generated and my charger isn't able to power the machine - my usb c ammeter just keeps cycling on and off. With the battery unplugged I am getting PPBUS voltage at 12.6V and correct negotiation of the charging voltage from the charger. The board however still won't power up i've checked some common voltages:\nPP3V3_SUS - present\nPPBUS - present 12.6v\nSMC_ON_OFF_L sits at 3.3v but does drop to 0v when power button pressed. \nSMC_LID sits at 3.3v when lid open and drops to 0v when lid closed\n\nWhen I initally connect my charger \/ usb c ammeter to the board when it's bare after negotiating the correct charger voltage I get a brief current surge to 1.5a then it drops down to 0.0a and stays there. \n\nI haven't delved to much further into this one yet however would appreciate any advice in where to look first or if there is any common issue with the behavior I have described!"
