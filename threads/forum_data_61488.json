        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",

        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",

Having lost my job in aviation I'm hoping to make a go of Mac board repair in the UK.\n\nIve had some luck with repairing a couple of MacBooks using Louis’s fantastic videos but the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> appears quite a chore to re-assemble just to spot fans spin with ribbon cables hidden by ribbon cables with the fans being left in the case and all.\n\nAfter the liquid spill its owner sent it to sleep and delivered to me within a day [he says].\nWont boot, no display but fans spin, no external display.\nBurnt LVDS ribbon cable adapter to screen (burnt at screen control board too), tried some test screens but waiting on new ribbon cable adaptor before further testing.\n\nSo the fans spin on this one already and this has thrown me. I am lost and need help!\n\nI have attached photos below of all corrosion I have seen on it in the hope for opinions on which must be removed, reflowed or replaced. I gradually purchasing spares of  components replaced in Louis's videos but I have only gained one <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1465</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> donor board so far.\n\nFrom what Ive learned from watching Louis’s videos it appears to reach the S0 state…..\nBut there are a few rails missing (are these supposed to be missing).\nAnyhow Ive embedded a few questions along the way (in brackets). Fanspin doesn't seem to be the reward for this board - what is?\n\n(I will just add my multimeter UNI-T UT139C seems to take a long time to settle down when measuring <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and the like. If I hold the probes on it might well drop half a volt after 40 seconds - not sure whats going on there - my other multimeters behave the same)\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>    13.1v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>    3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>    3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0</SIGNAL>        0.73v (shouldn’t this be 1.5v)\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0</SIGNAL>    0.85v (why does pdf say range 0.55 to 1.5v)\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0</SIGNAL>    0v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S0</SIGNAL>    1.2v\n<SIGNAL>PP0V6_S0</SIGNAL>    0.6v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0</SIGNAL>    1.8v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V0_S0SW</SIGNAL>    1v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>        5.2v\n\nppvccedram_s0_cpu    0v    (40ohm to earth, I expect this is ok????)\nppvccedram_reg_f        0v\n<SIGNAL>PM_OPC_ZVM_L</SIGNAL>        0v\n<SIGNAL>CPU_ZVM_L</SIGNAL>            0v (signal comes from <CHIP>U0500</CHIP> - what does this chip do?)\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_VCORE1</SIGNAL>    5v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_VCORE1</SIGNAL>    5v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>        0.5v    (should this be 1.5v, page 68 of pdf indicates 0.55 - 1.5v Why?)\n                    It seems to wander between 0.43 and 0.53 according to my multimeter.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_FAN_CONN</SIGNAL>    5.2v        Does this indicate fan wold be spinning if it was back in case?\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>            3.4v     Does this indicate lid(screen) open or closed?\n<SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL>        13v        Is this an ok level?\n<SIGNAL>BKLT_EN_R</SIGNAL>            0v\n<SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL>        0v\n\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>        3.2v        I left mentioning this till last because Im sure it was 0v when I first measured it.

I made measurements over multiple days and it does seem to have changed. I am embarrassed how long I have had this board - I tried and tried over 10 days before deciding to join the forum.\n\nForgot to say, my USB volt/ammeter shows  20volts supplied but 0.000 amps drawn.\n\nThanks again :)"

Yes I think for a beginner Ive got a pretty hopeless board.\n\nI have talked customer around into purchasing a refurbed board (at his expense)  but before going down this route he wants confidence in the rest of his computer working first. Its around $500 as it was 3.3GHz and 16GB/512GB\nIf I can keep him happy chances are I get to keep the broken board as a much needed donor.\n\nSo is there any way to get some confidence in the screen without using a working logic board.\ne.g. should the backlight come on with just the right voltage on the supply line and an earth? or does the screen rely on other signals to light the backlight?\n\nI wonder how does the screen supply business test returned screens? Im wondering if there is any cost effective solution to test them other than keeping a stock of working logic boards. Ive collected a bunch of broken screens from customer repairs but from examining pinouts theres big danger in assuming just because a connector fits together they have the same pinout."
