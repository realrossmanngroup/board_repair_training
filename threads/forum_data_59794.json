    "definitions": {
        "820-00138": "What is 820-00138? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "PPBUS_SW_BKL": "What is PPBUS_SW_BKL? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW": "What is PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW? PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW is a line after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit for backlight that connects to the LED driver’s switch(SW) pin where it is switched to ground rapidly in order to create the boosted voltage for the backlight circuit. .",
        "R7701": "What is R7701? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "Q7701": "What is Q7701? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created..",
        "BKLT_SDA": "What is BKLT_SDA? BKLT_SDA is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",
        "LCD_BKLT_PWM_R": "What is LCD_BKLT_PWM_R? a SIGNAL."

Haven't been here in a while lol.\n\nSo I've been dealing with this guy for a while--original problem had no backlight, had some liquid damage around backlight chips/lvds connector, cleaned 'em up and resoldered new connector. Have image, but still no backlight.\n\nNoticed pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> (<SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL>) wasn't low enough (12.93v), but resistance showed good between pin 3/4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> and of <RESISTOR>R7701</RESISTOR> (80.6K) and had 3.3v on <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN_R</SIGNAL>. Ran wire from <SIGNAL>BKLT_SD</SIGNAL> to ground to see if I'd get backlight, still nothing but now <SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL> is proper 5.5v and 1/2/5/6 <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> (<SIGNAL>PPBUS_SW_BKL</SIGNAL>) is 13.06v, passing thru <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> are ditto, 13.06v.\n\nI believe I read that this is due to something with <TRANSISTOR>Q7701</TRANSISTOR> being off? But that thread referenced a situation where <SIGNAL>BKLT_SD</SIGNAL> didn't have to be manually shorted, and I couldn't find much else, so I offer this to you guys.  :)"

It's probably the I/O board cable as I saw it had some corrosion on one end--will replace and update with if it fixed."
