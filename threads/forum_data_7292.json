Some one cleaned board, cant see burned items or corrosion. PPBUS_G3H is shorted ground when i inject voltage ppbus_g3h line after remove F7140 no where worming up:( checked every place board for any hot parts nothing. \n\nNote: Checked usb ,thunderbolt  and all connectors on board for damaged pins or like that.\n\nWhat can i do next step?"}
