How ever I replaced the LCD connector still no back light but I can see the background witha light.\n\nI check voltages and PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is 0.4v but some times 0v\n\nu7701 pin 9\/10 get 8.66v and 8.67v from the current sense .\n\nEDP_BKLT_EN IS 3.4V\n\nI2C_BKLT_SCL 5V ON PIN 15\n\nI2C_BKLT_SDA 5V ON PIN 16.\n\nQ7706 not opening the gate and send  power on pin 6,5,2,1 as BKLT_SD is 8.6v. I checked R7702 AND R7701 both accurate. \n\nIs this becoz of LCD connector? any  clue?"}
