It was pretty badly corroded. The pad underneath it was gone, There is no traces, the pad connected straight to a tiny Via that goes through the board, i have no way of knowing the value of the resistor or what it was connected to.\n\nAnyone got one of these i could compare measurements with?\nThanks"}

Can you take a picture of the area with the resistor, and then the resistor itself?"}

On the 15\" board I'm measuring 0.5\u03a9 with the resistor on the board. Measured with a Fluke 115. The top pin is ground. The bottom pin is measuring .502 voltage-drop to ground in diode mode. That should help you find which line it's on. It's not connected to anything in the area that I can find. It might be the other side of the board."}
