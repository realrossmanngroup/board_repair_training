SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this lineâ€™s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system.."

When I replace it, the computer will charge normally and work on battery and then after about a day it will blow again. This has happened with different genuine batteries and different genuine power adapters. We've cycled through the problem many times thinking it was the battery, and then no, it was the adapter, and on and on. It will happen with any battery or power adapter. Was liquid-damaged originally. Any idea what might be causing something like this?"
