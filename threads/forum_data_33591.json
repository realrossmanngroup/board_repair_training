When I replace it, the computer will charge normally and work on battery and then after about a day it will blow again. This has happened with different genuine batteries and different genuine power adapters. We've cycled through the problem many times thinking it was the battery, and then no, it was the adapter, and on and on. It will happen with any battery or power adapter. Was liquid-damaged originally. Any idea what might be causing something like this?"}
