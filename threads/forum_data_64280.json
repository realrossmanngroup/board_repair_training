        "A2485": "What is A2485? A2485 is a model number for a 16 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2021 M1 with EMC 3651, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-02100, 820-02382..",

        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
