Stay tuned.\n\nThat being said, the CPU gets warm when I plug the charger in, but there's no power. Would this eliminate the shorted <SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL>? I'm not sure if this is enough to get started (until I track down the schematic), but I'll edit this thread in a bit if I can find the schematic."

            "message": "Hey Duke, yeah the CPU got warm on the very last test I performed; I think the board IS powering on, but when in the top-case, it's not. The unit had no liquid evident, so I didn't check top-case yet, but board showed no signs of life the few times I tried in the case assembly. The CPU got warm only after I plugged the board in after removing from the top-case. I'll be getting some proper diagnostics on it tomorrow morning and will post back. I jumped the gun in posting this thread because I had no schematic, but there was no way to close/delete it immediately; I added what little info I had to help justify the thread, ha! Apologies for that.\n\nWill update soon with exact issue/questions."
