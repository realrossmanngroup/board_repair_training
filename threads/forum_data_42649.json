    "definitions": {
        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7010": "What is D7010? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year retina model macbook pros, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL? This is the voltage coming directly from the charger after going through a transistor. .",
        "SPI_MLB_CLK": "What is SPI_MLB_CLK? a SIGNAL.",
        "LPC_CLK24M_SMC": "What is LPC_CLK24M_SMC? a SIGNAL.",
        "C7590": "What is C7590? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C7572": "What is C7572? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "SPI_MLBROM_CS_L": "What is SPI_MLBROM_CS_L? SPI_MLBROM_CS_L is a signal that goes between the SPI ROM chip and another chip on machines with quad SPI, that can frequently corrode on 13” Macbook Air from 2015 because it is near the corner where liquid seeps in. This being corroded can stop PM_SLP_S4_L from being present. .",
        "SPI_MLB_IO0_MOSI": "What is SPI_MLB_IO0_MOSI? a SIGNAL.",
        "SPI_MLB_IO2_WP_L": "What is SPI_MLB_IO2_WP_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "SPI_MLB_IO3_HOLD_L": "What is SPI_MLB_IO3_HOLD_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "SPI_MLB_IO1_MISO": "What is SPI_MLB_IO1_MISO? a SIGNAL."
