            "message": "Have a 00239 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> board that has been a royal PITA. Ldo 3v3 was shorted on 3! (assuming customer had junk charger or dongle) of the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>’s (assuming customer had junk charger or dongle) and ultimately the last <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> wasn’t shorted but was not showing any voltage so had to replace it anyway. Lost some pads on the UB300/400 side so took forever but that side now is showing 5V and all LDOs and both ports turn off momentarily and turn back on so that side seems all good and that was one I was worried about due to repairing pads,etc.\n\nThe 3100/3200 side is now both showing 5V but not LDO 1V1 on either port with charger connected to its usB-c. Tried swapping Rom as it had shifted a little at some point during rework. Checked all diode readings around both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>. Not seeing anything. I’m thinking it’s got to be something related to the rom being both ports not producing LDO 1V1?"

All pads and traces are checking out. replaced the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> just in case and tried another rom and still nothing. I noticed some coms tie to the SMC. Any possiblity that could prevent the 1v1 or do you know if that is negotiated locally between the master, slave and rom?"

Although schematics refer to it as secondary it appears it is the connection to ROM. On my board, I had previously repaired pad <SIGNAL>UPC_XB_SPI_MOSI</SIGNAL> of <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> and while I thought that repair went well, the pad was gone when I pulled the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>. I repaired the pad again and reballed a different <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> just in case and it now boots. :) Thanks for your help!"
