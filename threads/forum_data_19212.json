        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U9701": "What is U9701? a CHIP.",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT is the voltage rail for the backlight of the LCD screen. .",
        "BLK_PWM": "What is BLK_PWM? BLK_PWM is a typo of BKL_PWM. When you see BLK_PWM assume the poster meant to type BKL_PWM. BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "Q9707": "What is Q9707? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "R9715": "What is R9715? a RESISTOR.",
        "R9704": "What is R9704? a RESISTOR.",
        "3V_S0": "What is 3V_S0? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
