Then fan spin for a second. On and on. (Not quarter fan spin) \n\nSo I check my PPBUS voltage. I got a constant loop of 9v to 0v. \n\nSo I took a look at the ISL area, the entire area was pretty bad with the liquid damage. So I replaced several resistors that looked bad, as well as the ISL. \nTested again: same result \n\nSo now I actually had to pull out my multimeter and think ??\n\nSo I took voltage measurements around ISL, and would get some solid voltages on some lines. But most of them where pulsing on and off. (Also much higher voltages than a known good) \n\nSo after hitting my head, on the wall for an hour. I decided to take the iPhone approach. Diode measurements. So I took measurements of ISL and compared to known good. Pin 17 was way higher than a known good (560 instead of the 130) \n\nSo I started following the schematic and ended at R7150. This resistor had the correct diode measurement ?so my next thought was, do I have continuity from pin 4 of R7150 and R7152. I did not. This was my issue. Somehow the trace between these two is broken (all pads and TP are okay) \n\nSo I ran a jumper from R7152 to U5600, and what do you know. Batteries charging. \n\nPretty much long story short: Diode mode for the Win. And this is why I decided to put out the DMs for the ISL chip. \n\nAs always: high quality pics available at: \n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]http:\/\/logiwiki.shinycomputers.com\/index.php\/MacBook_Diode_Measurements[\/URL]"}
