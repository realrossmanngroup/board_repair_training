When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging.."

            "message": "So I had an interesting one, and thought Iâ€™d share. \n\n<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> -  it came for battery not charging, powers on with charged battery \n\nWhen I disconnected the battery, I got fan spin for a second, then fan dying. Then fan spin for a second. On and on. (Not quarter fan spin) \n\nSo I check my PPBUS voltage. I got a constant loop of 9v to 0v. \n\nSo I took a look at the ISL area, the entire area was pretty bad with the liquid damage. So I replaced several resistors that looked bad, as well as the ISL. \nTested again: same result \n\nSo now I actually had to pull out my multimeter and think ??\n\nSo I took voltage measurements around ISL, and would get some solid voltages on some lines. But most of them where pulsing on and off. (Also much higher voltages than a known good) \n\nSo after hitting my head, on the wall for an hour. I decided to take the iPhone approach. Diode measurements. So I took measurements of ISL and compared to known good. Pin 17 was way higher than a known good (560 instead of the 130) \n\nSo I started following the schematic and ended at <RESISTOR>R7150</RESISTOR>. This resistor had the correct diode measurement ?so my next thought was, do I have continuity from pin 4 of <RESISTOR>R7150</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR>. I did not. This was my issue. Somehow the trace between these two is broken (all pads and TP are okay) \n\nSo I ran a jumper from <RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR> to <CHIP>U5600</CHIP>, and what do you know. Batteries charging. \n\nPretty much long story short: Diode mode for the Win. And this is why I decided to put out the DMs for the ISL chip. \n\nAs always: high quality pics available at: \n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]http://logiwiki.shinycomputers.com/index.php/MacBook_Diode_Measurements[/URL]"
