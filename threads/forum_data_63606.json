Both came in fully functional but just had screen damage (could see image and lcd damage)\n\nNot quite sure what one of our techs is doing but both Mac’s are now dead and further investigation has found that <SIGNAL>PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED</SIGNAL> is shorted on both!\n\nIs this common failure for this model? I don’t know how this fault could occur - any ideas? Can’t think of what is going wrong and causing this to happen but we can’t continue to have this happen.\n\nAppreciate any advice! Thank you"

(i tested it one time its like less than 2 mins after i see no display i removed the screen and put correct lcd)\n2. upon testing correct lcd <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2337</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> the macbook is not turning on.  <SIGNAL>PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED</SIGNAL> is fully short\n<CHIP>U7700</CHIP> is over heating. i tried removed <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>  <SIGNAL>PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED</SIGNAL> still short.\n3. i have fully working same model <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2337</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> i tested the  <SIGNAL>PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED</SIGNAL> diode to ground is 0.266\nboth are same board version <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-02016</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>\n\nmy question is the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2179</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> lcd cause to short the <SIGNAL>PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED</SIGNAL>."
