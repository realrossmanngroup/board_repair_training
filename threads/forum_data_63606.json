We\u2019ve had 2xA2337 MacBooks in within the last 2 weeks for screen repairs. Both came in fully functional but just had screen damage (could see image and lcd damage)\n\nNot quite sure what one of our techs is doing but both Mac\u2019s are now dead and further investigation has found that PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED is shorted on both!\n\nIs this common failure for this model? I don\u2019t know how this fault could occur - any ideas? Can\u2019t think of what is going wrong and causing this to happen but we can\u2019t continue to have this happen.\n\nAppreciate any advice! Thank you"}

(i tested it one time its like less than 2 mins after i see no display i removed the screen and put correct lcd)\n2. upon testing correct lcd a2337 the macbook is not turning on.  PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED is fully short\nu7700 is over heating. i tried removed u7700  PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED still short.\n3. i have fully working same model a2337 i tested the  PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED diode to ground is 0.266\nboth are same board version 820-02016\n\nmy question is the a2179 lcd cause to short the PPOV805_S1_VDD_FIXED."}
