        "message":"Some light corrosion in different areas. C6452 area, replaced all effected caps and resistors and checked around in diode for any stray shorts, also corrosion at C5101 area replaced all effected along with J5100.\nL8504 exploded and carbonized, replaced.  \nA spot of damage at the LCD end of the J8500 connector, normally I would think this brain dead but as far as I can tell by the way the damage looks the short was between just pin 2 and 44, is it safe to assume U5250 would take the hit and not the CPU?\nWhen plugged in it climbs up to 19.9V .72 amps and I get .88V on CPUCORE_SW1 and CPUCORE_SW2 briefly, then it goes down to 20v .01amp and it loses power.\nIs this a dead CPU. Any idea what to look at first here?\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"60%\"]57055._xfImport[\/ATTACH]"
