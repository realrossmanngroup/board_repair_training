I have removed F7140 and injected voltage on pin 2. Nothing is warming. Absolutly nothing.\n\nChecked <RESISTOR>R5450</RESISTOR> and seems that PPBUS is shorted to ground through <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS</SIGNAL>. Removing <RESISTOR>R5450</RESISTOR> short on PPBUS-G3H desappear.\n\n\nAny advice? Inject voltage on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> and check what is getting warm again?\n\n\nP.S. Also checked meanwhile <TRANSISTOR>Q7310</TRANSISTOR>/20 and <TRANSISTOR>Q7430</TRANSISTOR>/630 not seems to be the reason of the short"
