            "message": "Hi, i had a dead Mac Pro mid 2010 and replaced <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>, after which it came back to life. Now there seems another issue, the macbook is running slow, Everything is slow, installing new OS, even on an SSD. Tried to run a Apple HWT but that gets stuck 1 minute into the test when testing memory. Changed a few different modules, ones known to work well, but still the same. Any idea what could cause this?"
