Sometimes it will start with the bottom slot only but on boot kernel panic followed by restart.\nFirst conclusion was that both slots went bad (came across a case like this some time ago). \nI was thinking that this looks a bit different that any bad ram slot case I saw before so maybe it is not the ram slot but something else.\nChecked PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT. It is 0.75v.\nAnything else to check?"
