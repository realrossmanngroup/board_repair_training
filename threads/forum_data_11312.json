        "message":"I have PPDCIN_G3H, I have checked and have no shorts on any S5 rails, I have expected voltages around Q7085 but dead around Q7080.  I have PP5V1_CHGR_VDD (5.1) and SMC_BC_ACOK is 2.4V and CHGR_BOOT_R is 4.77V.  Have mV pulses on CHGR_UGATE.\n\nThere is no short on either side of L7030, current sense resistors on CHGR_CSO and CSi are as expected.\n\nI have STG on CHGR_AMON that goes away when ISL is removed.\n\nI am thinking bad ISL but don't have one on hand to swap, any others areas I can check to confirm while I wait for ISL?\n\nThanks\nBruce"
