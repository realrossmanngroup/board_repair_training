        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "CHGR_AMON": "What is CHGR_AMON? CHGR_AMON provides DC current sense information to the SMC(System management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip). It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",
        "CHGR_UGATE": "What is CHGR_UGATE? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP5V1_CHGR_VDD": "What is PP5V1_CHGR_VDD? a SIGNAL.",

        "CHGR_CSO": "What is CHGR_CSO? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q7080": "What is Q7080? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "Q7085": "What is Q7085? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "U6901": "What is U6901? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "U6900": "What is U6900? a CHIP.",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC? SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC is a voltage that is created if SMC_BC_ACOK & PP3V42_G3H are both present that powers the chipset for the onewire circuit that allows the SMC to talk to the charger on the SYS_ONEWIRE line. This is necessary for the magsafe charger to have a light on it. ."
