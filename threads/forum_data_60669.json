I tried it twice, and each time the screen wouldn't even power on, and only the first two LED's lit up. Granted, i'm not very elegant or efficient with micro-soldering yet, but i don't know anything i did wrong. Didn't see any joined pins, as far as i know no solder got into the connector from the side connections. Maybe the ground pins didn't completely connect to the board? (they can't really be wiggled to test out like the other pins can) Can you possibly give me some tips, pitfalls to avoid, common critical errors, etc. I figure this issue can come up with MacBooks as well, so hopefully you can offer some advice. thank you!"}
