When you connect the charger to the computer without the battery I get a solid orange light but it never turns on. During visual inspection, I was able to find a really corroded capacitor (C7202) near the U7200 (ISL95286)  area. I took some measurements near that area and noticed that the line PPVIN_S0_CPUVR_VIN was shorted to ground.  I chased this line down on the schematic and noticed that this line was creared by PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS and this line was shorted as well. I tried injecting some voltage into this line to find the faulty component but I wasn't able to find one. My power PSU will consume 0.98 @ 0.6v. I have attached a image of the damage. what produces this line? Im stuck here\n\nMy measurements are the following\nPPBUS_G3H 0.52v\nPPDCIN_G3H 15.02v\nPP3V42_G3H 3.40v\nPP5V_S5 0.92v\nPP5V_S5 1.10v"}

Hopefully I can get it working. The actual board number is 820-3662-A. As I stated previously, when you connect the charger to the computer without the battery I get a solid orange light but it never turns on. Atm, I have a short on PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS . What do you mean by high side FETs? Are you referring to the power fets? I check the power FET U8001 since it had a cpu line but it seems fine. Not sure where to go with this. Thanks!"}

I am just asking the resistance from one coil to another. It does not matter which side of the coil as the coils are 0 Ohm. So your measurement on L7320 to GND cannot be different on pin 1 and 2."}

I was able to remove the short on PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS by removing the mosfets U7310. U7320, U7330. The only crappy part is that the computer still doesn't boot up. It just shows me a orange with spinning fans. . I guess my CPU is dead. Right?  I checked the voltage on this line \"PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS \" and I'm getting 12.52v. \n\nThanks,"}
