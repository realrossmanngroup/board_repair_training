When you connect the charger to the computer without the battery I get a solid orange light but it never turns on. During visual inspection, I was able to find a really corroded capacitor (<CAPACITOR>C7202</CAPACITOR>) near the <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> (<CHIP>ISL95286</CHIP>)  area. I took some measurements near that area and noticed that the line <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0_CPUVR_VIN</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground.  I chased this line down on the schematic and noticed that this line was creared by <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> and this line was shorted as well. I tried injecting some voltage into this line to find the faulty component but I wasn't able to find one. My power PSU will consume 0.98 @ 0.6v. I have attached a image of the damage. what produces this line? Im stuck here\n\nMy measurements are the following\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 0.52v\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 15.02v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.40v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> 0.92v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> 1.10v"

The only crappy part is that the computer still doesn't boot up. It just shows me a orange with spinning fans. . I guess my CPU is dead. Right?  I checked the voltage on this line \"<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> \" and I'm getting 12.52v. \n\nThanks,"
