            "message": "I have a macbook air <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3209</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that turns on and runs, but runs terrible. I've tried several hard drives even external hdds. I when i try to boot into ASD 3s150 o.s. it gives me a circle with a line, but it will boot into the efi version of asd. I noticed the gpu gets really hot, fans on full speed. I did some probing around to find that i have a short to ground on <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0_VCCIO</SIGNAL> and also on <SIGNAL>PPVCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>. i ran down the <SIGNAL>PPVCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> line to find i have a short in the <SIGNAL>PP1V05_SO_VCCIO</SIGNAL> rail.\n\nIm thinking this could be a problem within the pch but not sure. Any help would be great.\n\nthanks."
