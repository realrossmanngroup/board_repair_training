            "message": "Got a strange one here. Board is in excellent shape, with no signs of corrosion or damage anywhere. When you try and turn it on, you hear it chime very faintly, and then it just keeps chiming over and over again and never turns on. Nothing on the screen and cap lock does not react. CPU VCORE is stuck at 0.930v at this time, so it appears to not be fully booting. I read that the chime loop can be caused by a bad bios, so I flashed a known good bios with a clean ME to this board. Now when I try to turn it on with just the charger and no battery, it does not chime at all anymore and CPU VCORE is still stuck at 0.930v, but the backlight on the internal screen is on now, but there is no image. If I connect a USB drive to it, the light lights up and flashes, indicating CPU is working, but the keyboard does not work in this state. No reaction from the caps lock key. I then tried to start it SMC bypass mode and it turns on with normal fan spin, not high fan like it normally does in SMC bypass, but now I get a low battery symbol on the screen for a few seconds and then it turns off. CPU VCORE is correct at 0.680v when I do SMC bypass and get the low battery symbol. I can only get that low battery symbol when trying to do an SMC bypass. If I try and connect the charger and the battery, CPU vcore is stuck at 0.930v again and now screen is completely off, no backlight. Do you think its a SMC issue since it seems to try and start is SMC bypass?"

While testing, I noticed that it will only show me low battery symbol and 0.6v on vcore when trying to start in SMC bypass mode with the charger connected to the UB300/400 side of the board. If I try the same on the other side, it turns on with high fan spin, faint backlight on the screen, but only 0.9v on vcore. I found that <SIGNAL>PP0V9_TBT_T_SVR</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground from UB000. I removed UB000 and have left it off the board for now. The short is gone, but still the same thing on this side, where it shows low battery when trying to start in SMC bypass. All other symptoms are the same also. The other weird thing on this board is <SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is 0.7v all the time, even on boot. This is not normal, since this voltage only should be enabled under heavy graphic load. It seems like the board thinks its under heavy graphic load immediately on boot, so maybe that could point us in the right direction of what could be the issue?"
