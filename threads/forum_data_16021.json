            "message": "Although very much a beginner, I have used a multi meter many times before. I'm confident that I'm using the meter right and looking at the right thing on the board. I am definitely pushing the limits of my electronic knowledge though. Hence coming here.\n\nSo I have traced out with my finger and checked the board view for the traces. The resistors check out fine. Something that I missed before, in tracing out and testing, I did find that there is an OL between Pin 4 of <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> and Pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R7052</RESISTOR>. On my donor boards these test as connected. Presume I can just run a wire to fix this? Is this likely to be the issue?"

            "message": "FIXED! Thanks to everyone that helped. Especially you, Jason. Much appreciated! That final post lead me right to the cause. I have learnt loads from this. Importantly, I have proved to myself that my soldering and hot air skills are up to the job.\n\nI still don't get any reading from testing between those pins on the ISL, not that it matters now but still a mystery that I'd like to solve. Perhaps my multi meter is a bit crap? Works for everything else though.... Will see if I can borrow a more expensive one to test that theory before shelling out on a more expensive one.\n\nJust need to tidy up the wire and all the other bits and pieces I have touched and then need to decide what ultrasonic to buy over here in the UK. Any suggestions?\n\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkdU5QsGlSg[/url]"
