Fans pulse on off on off constantly\n\nSMC reset no change\nPRAM reset no change\n\nUnplug battery with charger plugged in green light changes to orange wont boot and no fan spin\n\nSMC bypass fan spins on high as it should and computer boots and works. \n\nNo liquid damage and no signs of any other problem. I assume its an SMC issue but not sure where to start"
