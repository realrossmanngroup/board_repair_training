            "message": "Thanks, duke. I didn't realize that <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> issue was only a fix for GPU vcore-specific failures. These are all clean-pulls from failed units, yeah. I noticed that 3 of the 4 failed boards (i.e. the ones that weren't repaired by resoldering <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>) are the early 2013 2.4/8 configuration, whereas several of the ones that were successfully repaired were mid-2012 models (of various configurations). I wonder if that will give a clue as to which boards specifically will be more likely to be repaired? Or just coincidence. Interesting either way."
