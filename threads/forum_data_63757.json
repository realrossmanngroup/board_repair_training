There was very low resistance on three power rails. +1.8VSUS and +1.05VSUS and +3VA_DSW.  I removed the pch and the shorts were gone. i'm assuming they were shorts because they measured 0 ohms to ground. I replaced it with a brand new pch  and +3VA_DSW is normal again but the other two is back to very low resistance.  Is this low resistance normal or no? I don't want to try to power it up unless it's ok"}
