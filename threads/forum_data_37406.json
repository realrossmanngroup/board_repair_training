The battery isn’t charging with a massage saying that I should change the battery. In system info it does stating that it has 18 cycle. \nWas wonder if the 87w charger for the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> works with the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> laptop? I’m about to replace the battery but hate to do it if my issue is due to something new Apple are doing preventing high watt charges from working on the lower watt systems."
