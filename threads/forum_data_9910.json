        "message":"i've got this 820-2327, i know its an old one. it doesnt show a green light on the charger after water damage. i started taking messurements around the isl6258 chip and found a strange reading on chgr_agate- 16v on pin one of r7001 .04v on pin 2. check resistance of r7001 to find it has 62kohms, checked the resistor r7098 to find 280ohms instead of 100kohm, removed r7098 checked resistance at the pads and still had 280ohms resistance.\n\nfor some reason im not getting chgr acok out of the isl6285 but not sure about the 280ohs resistance on r7098.\n\nany ideas?"
