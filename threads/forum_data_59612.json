I investigated and found a heavily corroded section, a nice board to test my brand new Crest P1200 on. :) After 3 minutes of ultrasonic on each side, a distilled water bath, an isopropanol bath and some playing with my heat gun, the board looks brand new. Still dead though. \n\nLet's see...\n\nNo light on charger, so no power on PP3V42.\n\nChecked PP3V42 and found a resistor sitting on a corroded pad. Resistor replaced and now I've got PP3V42. Cool.\n\nTried to power it on, no luck.\n\nBack to work.\n\nMacbook is in S0 state. All rails present, except PPVCC goes ON (1.866V) and OFF(0.000V) every 4 seconds or so. To be clear, it is ON for 4 seconds, and OFF for another 4 seconds, and so on.\nMultimeter on continuity mode: Short circuit every 4 seconds.\n\nGoogle doesn't seem to know a lot about intermittent short circuits when in comes to Macbook board repairs, so here I am.\n\nMy newbie guess? A bad capacitor? A bad transistor? Dunno...\n\nI've got a thermal camera: <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> goes hot and cold every 4 seconds. Not sure if that's Cause or Effect.\n\nWhat can it be? And what's the best way to approach this issue?\n\nThank you."
