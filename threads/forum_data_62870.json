ASD shows TH1H below limit but when I check FINSTACKSNS_ALERT_L, it always reads 3.3V with or without the IO cable connected. I've tried 3 different IO cables and IO boards. DIode reading at pin 21 J9500 = .53. Replaced the SMC twice and checked for continuity from R5172 to corresponding pad 123 under SMC. I get 3v3 at TP SMC SENSOR ALERT. I'm at a loss as to what is causing this fault."}
