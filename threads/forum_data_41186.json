        "message":"Hello,\n\nI have a board that turns on, but does not charge and will only run off the adaptor. I switched it with a known good battery and it still will not charge, but it can run off the battery only if I first turn it on with the adaptor connected. Green light on charger and never turns orange.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is 12.3 volts.\n\nThere is evidence of work done to this board already from a different repair shop specifically Q7035 and Q7030 is not the original transistors and looks to be pulled from an Air board. I replaced the transistors as well as the ISL, but still get only 12.3 volts. CHGR_CSI and CHR_CSO circuitry I think is good.\n\nHelp please!"
