Has flashing folder. No backlight. Spill damage, but very minimal and nothing near LCD connector or U9701. Any idea what I'm missing?\n\n- BKLT_EN_L - 0V\n- BKLT_EN_DIV - 4.3V\n- F9700 is fine and has 12.6V on both sides\n- PPBUS_SW_BKLT - 12.6V\n- BKLT_EN - 3.15V\n- 5V_S0 present\n- D9701 Pin 1: 12.59V\n- D9701 Pin 2: 12.29V\n- Pin 1 of LCD connector has 12.29V\n- R9753 and R9757  are both good and have continuity to U9701\n- BKL_SW - 1.1V\n- BKL_FB - 5.8V\n- replaced U9701"}

Having the same diode reading on both sides can very well mean D9701 is shorted.\n\nLVDS_IG_BKL_ON is for backlight on Intel GFX, boot happens on Nvidia."}

Not shorted but I replaced it anyway because it shouldn't be the same value on both sides. It's 1.1 to ground in diode now on pin 2 and .890 on pin 1. And still not shorted. No change with new D9701."}

I will from now on, at least when I see one like this with no obvious hardware issues.\n\nthanks for your help, working normally."}
