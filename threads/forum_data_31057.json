    "definitions": {
        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "U9701": "What is U9701? a CHIP.",
        "5V_S0": "What is 5V_S0? 5V_S5 is an abbreviation for “PP5V_S0”.",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "BKLT_EN_L": "What is BKLT_EN_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKL_SW": "What is BKL_SW? BKL_SW means “BACKLIGHT SWITCH” – DC to DC boost circuits increase voltage by putting a lower voltage, like 8 volts, through an inductor. On the other side of the inductor, it is switched to ground rapidly - on this side, you will end up with an increased voltage as a result of the switching. BKL_SW usually refers to the pin on the LED driver that is attached to the inductor. .",
        "BKL_FB": "What is BKL_FB? This is backlight feedback. It goes from the output of the backlight circuit back to the LED driver, so it can see what it is doing. If this line is broken or corroded, the boost circuit will not boost PPBUS_G3H to a higher voltage for backlight, and backlight voltage output will be the same as the PPBUS_G3H input. This trace/via is usually the first to corrode since it is the highest voltage in the system..",
        "BKLT_EN_DIV": "What is BKLT_EN_DIV? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPBUS_SW_BKLT": "What is PPBUS_SW_BKLT? a SIGNAL.",
        "R9753": "What is R9753? a RESISTOR.",
        "R9757": "What is R9757? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "LVDS_IG_BKL_ON": "What is LVDS_IG_BKL_ON? LVDS_IG_BKL_ON is equivalent to LCD_BKLT_EN. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKL_SCL": "What is BKL_SCL? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKL_SDA": "What is BKL_SDA? BKL_SDA is an SMBUS data line between the LED driver and the system management controller(SMC).",
        "LCD_BKLT_PWM": "What is LCD_BKLT_PWM? LCD_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly.."
