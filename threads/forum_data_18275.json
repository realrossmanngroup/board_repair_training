I ran the EFI Test on it and I get the following error. \nVoltage (VG0R) -- MXM (test 1) - Error - Sensor is reading below the low limit\nTest Failed.\n\nAs I don't have the schematics for the iMac logic boards, can anyone point out for me as to where to look for that sensor so that I can fix this logic board.\n\nThanks\n\nRaj."

            "message": "Hi Duke,\nThanks for all your help.  I found out that one of the resistors <RESISTOR>R7116</RESISTOR> was shorted to ground.  After removing that resistor the short is gone.  I had one more question.  The resistor <RESISTOR>R7116</RESISTOR> has a value of 20K with 1%, 1/16W, MF-LF , 402.... This is too technical for me to understand.  But my question here is that I cannot find the exact resistor as per the specifications of <RESISTOR>R7116</RESISTOR> but instead I have some donor boards which says the following value... 20K, 5%, 1/16W, MF-LF, 402..  Is it OK to use a 5% instead of a 1% resistor.  If not, then what is the next alternative to replace this resistor.  Your help shall be highly appreciated.  Thanks  Raj."
