I ordered new <TRANSISTOR>Q7135</TRANSISTOR> and after solder in no short anymore, i put bacj the fuses but the board dont turn on\n\nNow i see i forgot to put back the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, its still pulled out but the short is back, after pulling again the <TRANSISTOR>Q7135</TRANSISTOR> no short anymore\n\nthe pulled out new <TRANSISTOR>Q7135</TRANSISTOR> is shorted completly\n\n\nso i need some help what can damage the <TRANSISTOR>Q7135</TRANSISTOR>? the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> is still pulled out."
