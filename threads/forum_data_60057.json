    "definitions": {
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BLK_PWM": "What is BLK_PWM? BLK_PWM is a typo of BKL_PWM. When you see BLK_PWM assume the poster meant to type BKL_PWM. BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "Q7707": "What is Q7707? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "R7704": "What is R7704? a RESISTOR.",
        "BLK_EN": "What is BLK_EN? This is a typo of BKL_EN When you see BLK_EN, assume they meant to type BKL_EN."
