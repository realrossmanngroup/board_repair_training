            "message": "Hi All,\n\nSo I have this nice Retina here with liquid damage.\nI cleaned it. Battery is dead.\n\nIt was powering on, but no CPU VCORE.\nI checked the power to <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> and I saw <RESISTOR>R7202</RESISTOR> was corroded. I changed it and it turned on for a sec or two and turned off.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> was 70-80 Ohm short to ground. I found a bad corroded cap <CAPACITOR>C1950</CAPACITOR>. I changed it with <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>.\nIt turned on for a second again. I was able to turn it on with SMC bypass, but after 10 seconds it turned off. Never could turn it back on.\n\nI found SMC crystal wasn't oscillating and there was no voltage on it. No short! I didn't have the same board so I took the SMC off of the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>.\nAfter I replaced the SMC the crystal is oscillating, but still not turning on. The fan just barely spins up. This is not a turn on-off loop thing.\nThis tries to turn on, turns off and it does not try to turn on again. I tried SMC bypass mode, but same thing. I couldn't find any short.\n\nIt still powers on if I remove <RESISTOR>R7202</RESISTOR>, just of course no CPU VCORE.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThank you!"

I changed the SMC with the correct one, but still no power.\nI lifted all CPUVCORE coils at the CPU side and checked them if I have anything on them without connecting it to the CPU.\nWith multimeter is show 3V which is extremely high. I checked with scope and it shows the PWM wave on both side of the coils. All of them(3).\nHow is that possible?"
