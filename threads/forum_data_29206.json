        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U7200": "What is U7200? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

All three chargers behave normally with other macbooks.\n\n[B]The diagnosis & repair work done so far[/B]\nI have replaced <RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7086</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> because they were all screwed with high resistance. I have replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. I also replaced <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> for good measure.\nSince doing the above, the device now boots in SMC Bypass mode with charger, but still nothing otherwise.\n\n[B]Some helpful measurements taken[/B]\nResistance between pins 17&18 of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> = 3.5Ω\nResistance between pins 27&28 of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> = 20Ω\n<SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> = 3.44v\n<SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> = 3.44v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> = 3.45\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.54v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> = 0.00v\n\nDevice still boots perfectly on battery, correctly identifies cycles etc and runs at full speed with normal fans - no boot on charger, and no charge. I'm starting to suspect the SMC, please tell me it's not the SMC, please...\nHALP!\n\nThanks,\nV."

What does ASD tell you about the sensors? Just wondering.\nEDIT: Check duke's response\n\nYou indeed need to get a SMC from a exact identical board"
