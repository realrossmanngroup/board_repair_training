            "message": "hello, \n\ni have a 2915 with gpu problem. i replacede the gpu, now the picture is ok\n\nand ASD is passing all.\n\nif i start from my ssd in sierra and i start the benchmark software Heaven to test the gpu. i can see it switsching and it is loading and just in the moment it should start the screen goes black.\n\ni replaced already the 3. GPU but nothing is changed.\n\nI measure the <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_GPU</SIGNAL>  <CAPACITOR>C8942</CAPACITOR> Pin 1, usually i Have there 1.12.and afte gpu turn on 0.92V\nNow I have there 1.22V and after turn on 1.02 V\n\nafter the software running \"heaven\" when the screen turn black I read on <CAPACITOR>C8942</CAPACITOR> Pin1 0V\n\nI replaced already <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and measured all resistors around it . found nothing.\n\nneed some help please"

            "message": "ASD passing doesn’t mean much more than your system will boot and handle minimal tasks. Wasn’t designed to really stress it. Usually if they can boot into ASD they will pass. \n\nYou probably have the power setting set to low power/automatically switch between graphics - when using basic tasks it uses the intel graphics and will switch to the AMD when needed (like heaven openGL). \nYou could disable the ‘automatically switch between’ feature but I think we can guess the outcome. \n\nif I understand you correctly, you’ve swapped the GPU 3 times? Chances are something is fried, blown off, or broken traces/ missing pads under the GPU. \n\nHave you successfully replaced other 2915 GPUs?\nGPU VCORE should drop to 0.9v when the GPU is initialized."
