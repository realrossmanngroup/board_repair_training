I found some issues while scanning through the microscope and also while measuring.\nCB300 was short\nUB300 was suspect\nUB400 was suspect\nL3500 was liquid damaged\n<CAPACITOR>C9503</CAPACITOR> was ripped, including one of its pads.\n\nAfter both UB300 and UB400 were replaced the device turned on again, but didn't take a charge from the USB-C power adapter. I tried several power adapters with sufficient watts.\n\nAt [URL]https://repair.wiki/w/A2141_2019_16%22_MacBook_Pro[/URL] I looked at the \"No Power. No life on USB-C amp meter, or 5V ~ 0A.\" symptom and did find 3.3V on  <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X</SIGNAL> and 12V at <CAPACITOR>C6961</CAPACITOR>. I was not sure how to check enable signal. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I should've checked any of these, because I have no clue where the problem originates.\n\nI do have the schematics and the boardview so I can find what you point me at, though I must emphasise that I am absolutely a junior board repairder and might ask follow-up questions which might seem pretty novice. I can measure every pin of every component you might need more info from when I can find it on the boardview.\n\nI await your reply.\n\nRegards,\nJelle"

I used the original power adapter and a spare one which can deliver more.\n\nI measured <SIGNAL>UPC_I2C_INT_L</SIGNAL> on pin 7 of J3000 and it reads 5.5mV. I expect that to be low and 3.3V or 5V to be high?\n\nEdit: the above is measured with the battery disconnected and the original power adapter connected."
