        "message":"I think by now we can give up all hope of ever seeing 216-0811000 becoming available at sensible prices. I have already posted this solution elsewhere, but since I have made some updates and thought I should put it here on the forum.\nThis involves swapping the GPU for a 215-0798006 and flashing the ROM with my modified VBIOS. The 0798000 and 0798006 are available and there are even 1649 date code 0798006 to be found. There are 2 VBIOSes, one for the 1GB models and one for 2GB. You should flash the ROM on an external programmer, it may be possible with some flash utility in OSX, but I will not figure that out for you.\nYou should also make a modification to the ODD thermal sensor. The modified VBIOS does not throttle the GPU and it runs hotter than the original chip. Apple did not implement the thermal diode on the GPU to ramp up the ODD fan. You have to move the ODD thermal sensor to the GPU heat sink as can be seen in the picture. It can be clamped between the heat sink and the bracket. I attach it wit some thin double sided tape to the heat sink and a piece of tape on the top to prevent shorting out to the bracket. Place it exactly as in the picture, this will give a balanced result of fan noise and heat.\n\nThis solution works fine is OSX and the card is still reported as a 6970M. If in a rare case someone is running windows you may have to mess with the .INF files of the driver to make it recognized as an HD6870.\n\nIf anyone is going to try this let me know how it works for you."

Getting better results with the chip sitting flat on the card, otherwise was difficult getting the corner balls to melt.\n\nOne thing to point out diagnostics indicate a missing GPU die temp sensor signal. However doesn't seem to affect the way the machine runs. \n\nThanks for this Duke...."

        "message":"There is indeed no thermal diode in the 215 chips on the pins where there is one in the 216 part. Let me see if I can come up with a hack to make the die temperature at least report something. This may also solve the throttling issue so I can enable that again in the VBIOS. This will probably involve cutting a few traces and running some wires.\n\nAlso screw you ATi, there is no reason to change something like this between 215 and 216 chips :("

        "message":"So it seems like the SMC is not measuring anything related to the MXM card. No voltage, no current and no temperature. I can only conclude that the system needs to see a supported GPU for it to enable those sensors. Since the DEVID needs to be changed for the 215 chips to work there is nothing I can do about this with regards to the video card. The ODD sensor modification is the best solution at the present moment to at least have some thermal control.\n\nIf anyone at Apple wants to \"share\" the SMC source code I'd be grateful!  Without the SMC source this sensor issue is not going to be solved."
