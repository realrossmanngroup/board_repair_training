This morning when I was double checking some things I got real fan spin, it would run about 5 seconds stop and start did that about 3 times then kicked off to actual boot. put the SSD back in it didnt want to turn on again. Unplugged the battery and tried again and got it to fire. When it wasn't powering noticed the SSD was getting hot also?"
