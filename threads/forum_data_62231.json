This board is a trip.\n\nBoard was sitting across the room with USB-C power connected with the same behavior as before I removed and replaced the passives, when U9580 suddenly exploded, and the right 12 pads were completely vaporized. After removing the remains of U9580, I found PP2V5_NAND_SSD0 to be completely shorted and PPBUS to be unaffected. The short is now in NAND chip U9100.\n\nMy analysis is that U9580 was intermittently failing and originally killed U9400, causing the system to cut power. After I removed the short, the elevated voltage on U9580's output was a result of it being on it's last legs, and when I saw it explode PPBUS was connected to PP2V5_NAND_SSD0, killing a second NAND chip and causing the short to return. Sound right to you?\n\nSo, from here... I was planning to replace all the NANDs anyway, is that still realistic in addition to U9580? Or now that we know that PP2V5_NAND_SSD0 probably got hit by PPBUS, is there a high likelihood of severe damage to other circuits such that I should call it quits?
