            "message": "Well, I think I figured it out... This board is a trip.\n\nBoard was sitting across the room with USB-C power connected with the same behavior as before I removed and replaced the passives, when <CHIP>U9580</CHIP> suddenly exploded, and the right 12 pads were completely vaporized. After removing the remains of <CHIP>U9580</CHIP>, I found <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> to be completely shorted and PPBUS to be unaffected. The short is now in NAND chip <CHIP>U9100</CHIP>.\n\nMy analysis is that <CHIP>U9580</CHIP> was intermittently failing and originally killed <CHIP>U9400</CHIP>, causing the system to cut power. After I removed the short, the elevated voltage on <CHIP>U9580</CHIP>'s output was a result of it being on it's last legs, and when I saw it explode PPBUS was connected to <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL>, killing a second NAND chip and causing the short to return. Sound right to you?\n\nSo, from here... I was planning to replace all the NANDs anyway, is that still realistic in addition to <CHIP>U9580</CHIP>? Or now that we know that <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> probably got hit by PPBUS, is there a high likelihood of severe damage to other circuits such that I should call it quits? Looking at the schematic, <CHIP>U9500</CHIP> is the only other IC that strikes me as likely to have been impacted."

            "message": "While I'm comfortable flipping NANDs, donor boards with 6x NANDs in a high capacity SSD configuration are extremely expensive, so I'm very hesitant to take the NANDs off my $275 donor board unless I'm confident this is going to work.\n\nI've now removed all six NANDs, and replaced <CHIP>U9580</CHIP> with <CHIP>U9080</CHIP> for testing. Now I have 2.5V on <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL>, but every 15 seconds or so the output collapses to nearly 0V for about a second. I noticed that PPBUS is going from 12.6V to 12.3V on the same schedule, is this normal for a board with no NANDs? The power consumption on my ammeter is steady at 0.05A 20V. After digging out the burned fiberglass, there was a huge hole in the board and I had to replace pretty much every pad that was not ground with a jumper, so it's possible there's a bad connection to <CHIP>U9580</CHIP>, but I don't see how this would cause PPBUS to fluctuate and I'm pretty confident in my soldering."
