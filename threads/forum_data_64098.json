I replaced UC300 because was missing <SIGNAL>P5VS2_BST</SIGNAL> for powering the backlight driver and that issues is fixed. \n\nThe MacBook is now  working and charging. The only remaining problem is the usb activity that is not there. Anything else looks clean and I don't know what to check to fix this problem. any suggestion ?"
