        "message":"hello guys, \n\nI have an 820-02020 board with a little bit of water damage. \nThe MacBook I got was booting but without backlight. I replaced UC300 because was missing P5VS2_BST for powering the backlight driver and that issues is fixed. \n\nThe MacBook is now  working and charging. The only remaining problem is the usb activity that is not there. Anything else looks clean and I don't know what to check to fix this problem. any suggestion ?"
