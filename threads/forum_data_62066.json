Measured resistance of all the coils around the CPU and got nothing under 1 Ohm so proceeded to inject 1v into <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, but nothing gets noticeably warm (used fingers + alcohol to test for hot spots on both sides of the board) and the PSU is pulling under an amp while injecting. Is it safe to go higher in voltage to get it to pull more current, or is there a better way to find the stubborn component?"
