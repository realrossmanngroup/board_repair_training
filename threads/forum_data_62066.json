PPBUS_G3H is shorted to ground on the system side (meter beeps in continuity mode, 0.109 in diode mode on system side with F7000 removed). Measured resistance of all the coils around the CPU and got nothing under 1 Ohm so proceeded to inject 1v into PPBUS_G3H, but nothing gets noticeably warm (used fingers + alcohol to test for hot spots on both sides of the board) and the PSU is pulling under an amp while injecting. Is it safe to go higher in voltage to get it to pull more current, or is there a better way to find the stubborn component?"}

It ended up being C6405 and C6406, they just barely heated up when injecting. Removed those and the board boots to the login screen. Will just need to replace from a donor and all should be well.

While trying to hold down D and boot into AHT and find out what sensor was causing the issue, the board turned off and now it draws 20v 0.53a and then falls down to 0.02-0.03a where it stays. All 4 ports exhibit this behavior. What the heck happened?"}
