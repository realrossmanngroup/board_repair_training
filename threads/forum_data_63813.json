Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. ."

I am assuming the ultrasonic cleaner did more harm then good. I am getting no video on the built in display, and no video on an external monitor, however the external monitor does detect a signal. <CHIP>U5450</CHIP> is heavily damaged. I tried scraping in one area/pin of where one of the pads should be (<CHIP>U5450</CHIP>), but I got to ground. Any hope?"

I ended up using a 5.6k resistor, thank you! Now I just found it is locked down with an Apple ID.  ¡Ay, caramba!"
