At first I was getting video on the built in display, but I stuck the board in my ultrasonic cleaner and now I have no video. I am assuming the ultrasonic cleaner did more harm then good. I am getting no video on the built in display, and no video on an external monitor, however the external monitor does detect a signal. U5450 is heavily damaged. I tried scraping in one area\/pin of where one of the pads should be (u5450), but I got to ground. Any hope?"}
