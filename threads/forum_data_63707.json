        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",

        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",

            "message": "Hello again, my CH341 bios programmer just arrived (as this is the only one I could find.) First I tried it with its latch but unfortunately it is not touching the pins of the <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> so I tried to took the <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> off from the board and tried to reprogramme it on the device. But it didnt work again. I have read that some computers need power on but I dont if I need to do it. \nBut in anyway I dont know if I am doing everything right or am I missing anything else?\nThank you for being patient with me. \n\nThank you"

            "message": "I had succeded on reading chip but I realised that you can see on video. The chip must be programmed as 3.3v but when I choose the chip after detect it comes as 1.8V. And you can see what I am doing step by step on video. Am I doing anything wrong or missing? Because after I programme the chip I click on verify but it gives me an error that you can see on attached photo and after I put this chip on board it does not boot (no apple logo or anything. It was booting before but it was slow.) Do I need to do any modification or something to force ch341 to programme the chip as 3.3V?\nVideo: [URL='https://www.veed.io/view/43649f90-e0ff-492c-b00d-5b8f39cef4b0?sharingWidget=true&panel=share']Video Of Programming[/URL]\nPhoto: [URL='https://ibb.co/NVWy4mk']Verify Error[/URL]\nThank you"
