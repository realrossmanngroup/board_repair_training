Good image. Tested old screen on another macbook -> Good image. \nNo voltage on lcd connector pins. L8304 jumps to 3V for a milisecond and disappears. \nIs it screen or motherboard problem?\n\nThanks!"

I removed the display bezel and looked at io board and replaced lcd cable but still same problem. So I guess new screen is the only solution then.\n\nTHanks."
