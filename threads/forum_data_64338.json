Only 5V on ampmeter, and 0A.\n\nClient said that it had the mac storaged for a long time, and now it just don't power on. \n\nNo signs of any damages on the board.\n\nDiode readings on the big coils seams to be ok (not sure cause don't have any good board to compare).\n\nPPBUS_G3H seams to be shorted. 0.020 on diode reading and 0.165V\n\nCan I inject voltage here to see if anything gets hot?"}
