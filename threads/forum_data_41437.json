Upon inspection, Unit was fully working with the external keyboard. It would accept keyboard shortcuts at boot but nothing once we were in os. We found quite a few places with liquid residue. Put it through cleanup in crest ultrasonic cleaner. It will not power on now, no chime, no backlight no spin. I have 3rd party charger that goes green when plugged.\nHad a look under a microscope and nothing pops out.\nPlease advise\n\nKind regards,"}
