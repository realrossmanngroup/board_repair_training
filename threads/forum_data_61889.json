        "message":"Hello. Got this board here. It's on S0 state, trackpad clicks and CPU gets hot. It pulls 550mA from charger but no post. I tried first disconnecting screen as the internal flex was poked by someone who claimed to have fixed it(?!?!?!). Tried on external display without internal screen connected but no POST. As I was getting VCORE I tried to flash new known working BIOS to it, but still same result. Suspecting maybe bad CPU. Any ideas?"
