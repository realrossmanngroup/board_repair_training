Noticed immediately PP3v3_sus was shorted to ground and 0v, though nothing was getting warm, pch was normal, and 3v3_sus coming out and to of the pch was present, and 3v3_sus at u8130 was present as well.\n\nMy question is how should I go about fixing this?  run a wire from u8130? where does 3v3_sus come from, to u6100?\n\nby the way u6100 is removed and pin 8 is still shorted on the board."}

Like a leakage to ground?"}

Pin 8 was fully free, not connected to ground, or anything, then I soldered a wire from pin 5 of U8130 to pin 8 of u6100, and yay we now get 3.3v on the spi chip. However still same 94 mah.\n\nWill be uploading voltages shortly\n\nrealized pin 7 has a trace connecting to it, and it might have been smarter to just leach off of that but anyway"}

I narrowed it down to u7600, pin 13 is 0V, whole circuit looked fishy so I replaced almost all resistors and capacitors, and u7600. However still same issue. I noticed pin 13 was 0v but r7601 was 5v. Checked continuity and there is none. Going to run a wire now\nthis board seems like it was bent or dropped or something before, so many broken traces, most non important tho, these are only two known critical."}
