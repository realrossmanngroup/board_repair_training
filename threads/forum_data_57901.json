        "message":"Alright, this one kept me up all night.\nHave an 820-00165 that came in with corrosion in a few places, namely around U7600 and R1673 area. Was missing S0_CPU originally, replaced a resistor for S0 cpu power (can't remember which one, sorry) and that fixed it, managed to boot into os and everything. Also replaced a few other corroded components, tested again, still working fine. Put board in ultrasonic to clean, a few hours later after drying board won't start, I get green light and S5 rails, but no S4. Also missing PM_SLP_S5\/S4.\nI have 32khz clock and pp3v3_sus, but it doesn't seem like PM_SLP_S5 or S4 pulse when triggering SMC_ONOFF.\nI'd really appreciate some advice, feel like I got stuck. Thanks"

I have one of the small \"pocket oscilloscopes\". I know they're generally junk but I've used it before to see pm_slp pulsing, so I should be able to see the pulses here too.\n\nI removed the CPU edge resin and heated with amtech 559 at 200C for about 1-2 minutes. Sadly no result from this. Maybe my amtech is fake (from ebay) but it's worked well for normal soldering and cleaning corrosion.\n\nAnything else I can try? It kills me that the board was working before going into the cleaner, never had it kill a board before"
