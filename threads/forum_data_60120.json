I'm pretty sure it just needed a new <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> and some solder mask repair. So I put a new <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> but not it draws a steady 450mA  but no chime amd no image. The only corrosion found was in the area of <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>. Now I am stuck with an LB that doesn't post. I checked the G3H rails which are present, <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> is there, RTC is 3.3V, <SIGNAL>PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL> is 3.3V. Not sure what to check next. I get a pulse on PIN 6 of <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> when first turning on the LB but when I plug a USB stick into the USB port, It is just a solid light, no blinking."
