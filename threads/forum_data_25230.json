        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",

        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

            "message": "I had a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> come in with heavy corrosion on the edge where most of the liquid will come in. Cleaned all the areas up with flux and heat and ran it through the USC. All working. Replaced quite a few corroded and burned components and all was working. There was corrosion on the CPU fets so I replaced them. Let it run for a sec.. It chimed and booted so I thought OK this is done so I put it in the slot to reassemble later. \n\nI go to reassemble it, all back together so I test it. It's power cycling now. Did a light reflow on the SMC as I know crap under it can do this. S5 rails are present but all s4 s3 and s0 rails are pulsing. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.56 v as normal. The smc is NOT in reset mode. Vcore is doing nothing and ALL SYS PWR good is pulsing as well. I replaced the clock chip to be sure. <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> was good but I though just maybe something went funny with it so I replaced it. No luck. Ran it through the cleaner one more time and still nothing. Still power cycling. Here are my findings : \n\nALL SYS - Pulsing \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> present\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> pulsing \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> pulsing\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> Present\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> pulsing\nVcore absent w/ no pulsing. \n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> - pulsing \n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> - pulsing \n\nThanks Duke or Louis in advance."
