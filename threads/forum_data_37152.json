Trying to figure if is a board or parts problem, don’t have any donors to test at this moment.\n\nTakes a little longer to boot, and no mouse or keyboard detected. One or two times, mouse worked, but it froze and powered off.\n\nDid some measurements and all rails looks ok!\nShould I buy a keyboard/mouse flex first?\n\nDoes It take longer to boot without mouse/keyboard?\n\nI’m doing some research on how this machines works, but any thoughts to share would be appreciated!\nTks"
