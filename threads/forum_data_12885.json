    "definitions": {
        "820-2327": "What is 820-2327? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D6905": "What is D6905? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input on very old Macbooks(before 2011), can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",
        "D7010": "What is D7010? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year retina model macbook pros, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "ISL6258": "What is ISL6258? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2008 through 2009.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP1V05_S5": "What is PP1V05_S5? PP1V05_S5 is a 1.05v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. On 2008-2009 15” and 17” Macbook boards, this often gets stuck at 0.3v due to a bad C7771 capacitor. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "U7500": "What is U7500? a CHIP.",
        "PP5VLT_S3": "What is PP5VLT_S3? a SIGNAL.",
        "P5VLTS3_EN": "What is P5VLTS3_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP5VLTS3_EN": "What is PP5VLTS3_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. ."
