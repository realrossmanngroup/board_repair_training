This was cleaned up and cable was replaced with a  known working cable.\n\nPasses EFI HW tests. \n\nOnly issue I can find is that it will not go to sleep with the lid closing, otherwise it works perfect. I can even put it to sleep manually, through the OS.\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is ~ 3.3v with lid open and lid closed. \n\nI am at a loss. I have searched old topics, but most don't have this situation. And those that do, they as a question, the Duke asks them for more info and then they never respond back...\n\nI would love to have some guidance on where to even start looking... \n\nThank You for any help."

Thanks!\n\nJust as an FYI for those who still mess with the 2010-2011 11\" MacBook Air models... The IO/Audio board from 2010 will work in a 2011 model... BUT!!! Not the other way around. All connections looks the same, and the are, but there are differences in the audio chipset that will make it not work 100% in the 2010 machine. It kept the audio output as the headphone jack, but even the sound from headphones, when plugged in was low and full of static. Swapped the i/o boards back and both machines worked perfectly!! Rookie mistake, I guess. Hope this info can help others driving themselves crazy!\n\n\nPlease mark as closed!"
