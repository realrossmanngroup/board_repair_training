What would be the best way to reattach it to the board? I know superglue is frowned upon, so is there a epoxy that would work better? Should I solder it back into place? Would that be strong enough? Andy advice?"}

The fan has 3 different screws, a long one(middle), one with a big head(IO board) and a short one(board side)."}
