When I plugged in the charger for the first time it spun for a couple seconds then turned off. The fan no longer spins at all when I plug the charger in.\nThe I\/O board looked to have some damage to it so I tried with a new one and still the same issue. When I took the board out the only liquid damage I could find was by the SMC.\n\nI removed the edge bonding completely put some flux and heated the area. I see that the 4 SMC modes (SMC_TDI, TDO, TDS, TCK and SMC_INT_L) and the probe points next to them are gone. \nI try putting some solder on the point but there is no pad so the solder is not sticking. Also there is no continuity from the probe point to the resistor.\n\nIn order to repair this do I just scratch at the traces and run a wire to the resistors?"}
