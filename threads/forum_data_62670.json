Does somebody knows this?\n\nWhen the charger has been plugged in, but disconnected from the laptop, or connected to a non working USB-C port, there's nothing visible on the VBUS output, nor on the CC pins.\nMeasured with scope as well as with a multimeter. Nothing.\nConnecting this charger on a working port, immediately 5V.\n\nWhat's the trigger to start the 5V on VBUS?"}
