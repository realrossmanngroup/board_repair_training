The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",

What i'm wondering is, if it was either of these guys, would the power button still respond when i press it to shutdown the computer? Plus from the <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL> voltage drop when i press the power button, it appears the keyboard may be working as well. Why i was thinking of going for the smc is due to having 3.4v present, which is fed from what i believe is a pull up resistor (<RESISTOR>R5170</RESISTOR>). Since this voltage is present, i'm thinking the trace from that resistor to the smc must have corroded away."
