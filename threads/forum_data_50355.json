Replaced all corroded capacitor and resistors along with SMC chip (due to short seen on Couple of caps). \n\nRepaired and board now boots up. \n\nNew Weird issue: can?t power up the computer using the power button. However, I can perform SMC reset, power off the computer by holding down on the power button. I power on the computer when MagSafe is connected right after reconnecting battery."

        "message":"I currently do not have a keyboard\/trackpad parts for the model to test with (i checked and ohmed out the ribbon cable from the trackpad to the logic board, just incase there were bridge connections, and it ohmed good). What i'm wondering is, if it was either of these guys, would the power button still respond when i press it to shutdown the computer? Plus from the smc_onoff voltage drop when i press the power button, it appears the keyboard may be working as well. Why i was thinking of going for the smc is due to having 3.4v present, which is fed from what i believe is a pull up resistor (R5170). Since this voltage is present, i'm thinking the trace from that resistor to the smc must have corroded away."

It just keeps restarting itself after I power down the board. I even unplugged the keyboard and it still powers itself back up after i power it down. I confirmed the wire i installed was bridged across another pad and then also pulled the wire with the same result. I had noticed this issue earlier today but it went away, so thought it was a fluke"
