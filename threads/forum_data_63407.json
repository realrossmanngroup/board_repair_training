I replaced around 25 components in the USB-C power circuitry and the board successfully starts up now and works. \n\nThe USB-C ports work for charging and but they don’t recognize my external drives. I’m obviously missing some data path functionality in the USB circuitry… where to look?\n\nInterestingly, the drives are recognized in startup manager (option during startup). They also work when I load Big Sur, but not Monterey or Ventura."
