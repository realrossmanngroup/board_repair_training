        "message":"I have a 2017 Pro board that came in with no power and heavy liquid damage on the logic board underside. I replaced around 25 components in the USB-C power circuitry and the board successfully starts up now and works. \n\nThe USB-C ports work for charging and but they don\u2019t recognize my external drives. I\u2019m obviously missing some data path functionality in the USB circuitry\u2026 where to look?\n\nInterestingly, the drives are recognized in startup manager (option during startup). They also work when I load Big Sur, but not Monterey or Ventura."
