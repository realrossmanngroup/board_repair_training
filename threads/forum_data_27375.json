Checked around and is missing PM_SLP_S4_L\n\nI have a clock signal, S5 voltages and PPBUS_G3H. Amber light on charger and PP3V42_G3H fine. However I only had 1V on SMC_PM_G2_EN.\n\nReplaced SMC and I have 3.4V on SMC_PM_G2_EN, SMC_RESET_L is fine. However I have 0V on SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD and still no PM_SLP_S4_L\n\nI put it all back together (I can't remember if these is one of those that needs a battery to power on) and noticed that I got no fan spin even in SMC bypass. However, with the battery connected and I plug the magsafe in or press the power button the fan spins fast for 1 second then turns off.\n\nReplaced BIOS and Clock Chip like a monkey just in case but still no luck.\n\nAny ideas what to check next? Throw it in the bin?\n\nReally appreciate the support thanks!"}

Probe this at C6100 or U6100 as I've seen the trace to the bios area gone bad before."}

I'll learn one day... \n\nI'm pretty sure it was an SMC from an identical board but in all honesty it came out of a box I previously labelled rather than straight from a board with a hole through it so cannot 100% confirm. I'll try another SMC and may as well run it through the ultrasonic cleaner for fun. Weirdly after replacing SMC I had 1V on SMC_PM_G2_EN for a while before it magically went up to 3.4V and has been stable since."}

THE SMC I USED HERE WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY AN 820-3437 BY MISTAKE. NOT AN 820-00165\n\nOK so I tried another SMC off a donor board - absolutely dead - solid green light on charger after 3-4 attempts and 100% sure it was soldered correctly. I've run out of SMCs for the 00165 so I've ordered more from china. In the meantime I've put back the original SMC and original BIOS and stuck the board through the ultrasonic:\n\n\nPPBUS_G3H 8.2\nPPDCIN_G3H 16.14\nPP3V42_G3H 3.412\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.332\nPP5V_S5 5\nPP5V_S4RS3 0\nPP5V_S0 0\nPP3V3_S5 3.299\nPP3V3_S4 0\nPP3V3_SUS 0\nPP3V3_S3 0\nPP3V3_S0 0\n\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN = now 3.4 (it was 1.07 before)\nSMC_PM_G2_EN = 3.4\nPM_SLP_S5_L 0\nPM_SLP_S4_L 0\nPM_SLP_S3_L 0\n\nIn SMC bypass mode I get fan spin for about 10-15 seconds (with heatsink on) then machine powers off. Any ideas where to go next or should I wait for my donor boards with SMCs to arrive? I have a load of 820-3437 SMCs but I'm guessing these won't work for this board?"}

If so then there is at least a problem with the SMC or ISL6259.\n\nAlso your symptoms have changed since the first post as your were getting only 1 second fan spin then.

Is that normal?). 8.6V with battery disconnected.\n\nMy shipment of 820-00165 donor boards finally arrived and I put another SMC on - same symptoms as when I started when I was getting 1 second fan spin. This happens ONLY when both magsafe + battery are connected (automatic 1 second spin when battery connected and I then connect magsafe or vice versa) or I do an SMC reset with magsafe + battery both connected.\n\nAt least I'm back to where I started.
