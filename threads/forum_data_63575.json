        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."

            "message": "Hello,\n\n<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3435</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A arrived with water damage. The water ingress indicator near J8300 is red. Two pins on J8300 corroded (disappeared) and I found some mild corrosion at <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> area. The latter was minimal and looks alright after cleaning with IPA. Two pins missing are pin 3 and 4. Both are PPHV pins feeding the backlight, so perhaps too much of a coincidence that these two are gone.\n\nJ8300 probably needs replacing but I am trying to establish if the rest of the board is ok before I embark on this journey.\n\nI am not paying much attention to <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> area at the moment as I suppose it is mostly backlight related and we seem to be far away from turning on the backlight.\n\n<CHIP>U5611</CHIP> has some minor corrosion, pins, pads and solder look good.\n\nUpon connecting to the power supply (no SSD, no wireless, no flex cable), the board switches 3 times between 450mA and 21mA and then settles around 520mA. Fan starts normally but ends up at full spin perhaps due to the flex cable being missing. CPU warms up slightly.\n\n<SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is high at 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is at 1.3v (is this too low) ? This makes me think that the board reaches S0 state successfully.\n\nThere is no USB activity after 15-20s.\n\nWhat would be your recommendation to check next trying to establish if any other issues exist other than the corroded screen connector?\n\nThanks"
