Now not getting Keyboard backlight no voltage on enable to <CHIP>U7750</CHIP> (0v on <SIGNAL>SMC_SYS_KBDLED</SIGNAL>), checked trace to smc  was good, checked fb resistor and traces, good. Replaced smc still same. Tried clean bios and good keyboard backlight but still the same. Tries boot into different Os still no backlight.\n\nAny help appreciated"
