            "message": "I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B that powers on fine and begins loading the Apple logo with loading bar underneath. It takes a while, and then white screens after loading about 75% of OS. Immediately after white screening, the entire macbook shuts off and needs to be rebooted (although occasionally it bootloops in this fashion). Have tried booting into an eternal OS as well a diag drive, but it again white screens after selecting one of the options to boot. Motherboard appears to be clear of any obvious corrosion/physical damage, and there is no known liquid exposure that I am aware of. Any thoughts?"
