It takes a while, and then white screens after loading about 75% of OS. Immediately after white screening, the entire macbook shuts off and needs to be rebooted (although occasionally it bootloops in this fashion). Have tried booting into an eternal OS as well a diag drive, but it again white screens after selecting one of the options to boot. Motherboard appears to be clear of any obvious corrosion\/physical damage, and there is no known liquid exposure that I am aware of. Any thoughts?"}
