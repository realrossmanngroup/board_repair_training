Corrosion near <CHIP>U2500</CHIP>, <CHIP>U3210</CHIP>. light heat in <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> and <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>. I replaced the <CAPACITOR>C2411</CAPACITOR> and the board started. I also replaced <CAPACITOR>C3280</CAPACITOR>.\nthen these strange pixel bars are present. Their presence changes when the system is used. Small irritants even sometimes disappear.\nF??k them, what's their problem?"
