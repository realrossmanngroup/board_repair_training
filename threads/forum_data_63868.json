After removing <CAPACITOR>C6501</CAPACITOR>-<CAPACITOR>C6503</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C6405</CAPACITOR> board started to boot with 20v for a few seconds but boot looped and then was stuck at 5v.\n\nReviving T2 in DFU solved the 5v issue. The machine now turns on and boots into the OS. The issue is when you go to restart the machine it will not turn back on, same applies to shut down and attempt to turn back on. The battery needs to be disconnected/reconnected for it to turn back on again.\n\nAnother observation is after reconnecting the battery the master usb-c port will be stuck at 5v 0amp but all other ports will work fine however after inital power on using any other port that port works fine again at 20V.\n\nBattery is aftermarket that was replaced by someone else. OS says its normal and passes apple diagnostic. Not sure if that could be causing this issue?\n\nWhat should be tried next?"
