I got a board that was not powering on. After inspection I found corrosion around U3710. Put some flux on it, set my TR1300 station to 350 Celsius with medium airflow and gave it some heat. After 20 seconds or so the top layer seemed to pop and went back into position. I tried recalling the SMC and replacing it also, but still no green light. I have no shorts and PP3V42_G3H is present. PPBUS_G3H is 8.15V instead of 8.56V. I think that popped layer broke something internally to the board. Any way to verify that or the board is junk?"}
