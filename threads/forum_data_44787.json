When ac adapter is plugged in backlight comes on for a few seconds and then turns off however if unplugged with just battery backlight stays on along with question mark folder.\n\nu4500 also had mild water damage but do not believe that is the cause of the problem.\n\npp3v42_g3h is 3.42V\n\nwhat to check next?"
