            "message": "Thanks, suspecting the SMC reset after fixing that traces didn't go well. Tested with third battery and start charging. When I placed the original battery now, it is pulling >1A current, but seems like internally is not functioning well as it shuts down the minute I pull the plug. \n\nWorks with another battery and charges well, though.\n\nRegarding these, I have seen them but am not sure how usable will be in my workshop. With NLBA, unless I plan to repack/recycle and sell used batteries, which will be hard to convince a customer. I cannot see commercial use of it. Considering new doggy replicas go for under 100$. It will probably be better with a recycled battery with this tool than a doggy amazon/eBay battery, but it's still hard to convince to be paid for it.\n\nPort tester makes sense."
