        "U5701": "What is U5701? this is the keyboard controller chip that takes the keyboard and trackpad input and turns it into a USB device signal for the machine to process. If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",
