        "message":"Have a a 820-000165 that had mild liquid damage on U7501 specifically only on pins 12-16. Replaced U5701 but no change. Noticed there is a 0.003 short on P5VS4RSE_EN_R. When R7551 is removed the short is gone.... 5v is at pin 4.  As soon as R7551 is back the short returns. Tried running jumper from P5VS4RS3_EN to pin 4 but short returns.\n\nWhat to try next?\n\nPPBUS_G3H 8.60V\nPP5V_S5 5V"
