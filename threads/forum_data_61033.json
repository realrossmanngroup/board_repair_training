This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",

The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
