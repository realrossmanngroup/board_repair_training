        "R6990": "What is R6990? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on Macbooks from around the year 2012. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",

SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC is a voltage that is created if SMC_BC_ACOK & PP3V42_G3H are both present that powers the chipset for the onewire circuit that allows the SMC to talk to the charger on the SYS_ONEWIRE line.

Two of them I repaired ... still working on the third. No liquid damage. And no visible board/trace damage. Just the few components visually blown on the top.\n\nFound <DIODE>D6990</DIODE> and <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> were blown. <RESISTOR>R6990</RESISTOR> was bad as well as <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> and <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Replaced all of that and a couple of caps, <CAPACITOR>C6991</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C6994</CAPACITOR> right next to <CHIP>U6990</CHIP>.\n\nPlug it in ... get a green light for about 5 seconds. Then no light, once in a while it comes on for a second or two. <CHIP>U6900</CHIP> pins 1,4,5 - 2.95v. <CHIP>U6901</CHIP> - Pins 1,2 - 3.2v .. pin 4 - 3v, pin 5 - 3.42v.\n\nSMC reset is at 3.4v.\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> - Pin 1-3 12.3v .. pin 4 12.7v .. pin 5 18.2v.\n\nFound 18.6v coming in has a voltage drop every 5-6 seconds. Usually 1.5-2 volts on the meter. Which of course causes the 16v to drop as well. Fuses check ok (found one acting like a resistor on one of the other repairs).\n\n\nAt this point, any tips would be helpful. Not exactly a noob to board repairs, but not a veteran either. Just got into mac's as well. Will be back in the shop Thursday, but the above is what I recall at the moment."
