Checked DC in board and jumper. SMC reset was 1.9v but <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> was 3.4v. checked the pull up resistor and it was 100k as its supposed to be. I replaced <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and now my SMC reset is 2.9v but it seems it will move around. still no light on charger. i suspect bad SMC. not sure though what should i try."
