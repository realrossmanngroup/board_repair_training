Customer said laptop worked until image disappear. Connector is rusted out and few pads completely burnt out. That is straight forward. Main issue is that it doesn't turn on from power button, green light present.\nI found identical topic on advanced rework with no solution and reference to 3 Luises videos. Non of them really applicable in my case. There is no water damage nowhere near SMC.\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL> missing\n<CHIP>U7201</CHIP>\npin 4 = 0v\npin2 = 0v\npin12 =3v\npin21=3v\npin23= 12v\npin22=3v\npin13=2v\npin29=5v\n\nThe other thing is that it chargers if I attache the battery (yellow light).

I guess not cause it needs the battery to turn on if you don't.[/QUOTE]\n\nI used 65w as I didnt have original 85W, I figured if Voltage is the same it should be okay for diagnostic purpose. Obviously I was wrong.\n\nWith non original 85 charger I get fan spinning as soon as I plug it in and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_I</SIGNAL> 3.3v. Thank you Duke.\n\nLast quick question, shouldn't it chime after I connect power and fan spins? I dont get the sound with board speaker connected (ram is connected, hddd not), and it will take me some time to fix lcd connector (need jumpers) and order new lcd flex before I can test it."
