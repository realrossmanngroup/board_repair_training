        "message":"Hi there,, \n\nI have a clean board that boots but is having issues reloading. When trying to recover it loads the OS through wifi and\/or ethernet but after the first screen hitting continue it claims it can't communicate with the recovery servers and exits the install. I tried loading from external which sometimes works but not in this case. I believe I'm getting it in DFU but it isn't showing when connecting to my host Mac. I don't get a thunderbolt error and I've had a fair amount of success with other Macs recently.\n\nI am pretty sure it is getting into DFU just not showing in configurator. I tested the front left port with external drive and it does communicate with that port. Do you know another reason it wouldn't see DFU? I even tried jumpering the board at DFU Force jumper."
