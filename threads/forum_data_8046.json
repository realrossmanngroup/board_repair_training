PBUS sense is working fine - 2V on R5488. ASD fails whetstone test but nothing else. I've never seen this where it wasn't a PBUS sense issue."}

Works great with adapter plugged in. Slows down by about 30-40% on battery - beach balls. Plugging it back in fixes the problem immediately. No liquid-damage at all to Q5480 area - PBUS circuit is fine."}
