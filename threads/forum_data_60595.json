I tested it\non the backlight output i have 11.7V\ni have found out that if i measure <RESISTOR>R7702</RESISTOR> on pin 2 (with a multimeter) the backlight starts working. So i changed <RESISTOR>R7702</RESISTOR>. But still the same issue.\nI have also changed the following parts: <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>, <DIODE>D7710</DIODE>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7701</TRANSISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7701</RESISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7700</CAPACITOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR>\n\ni am a little lost. What could be the issue here."
