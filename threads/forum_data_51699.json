The sound icon is blurred out.\n\nNo water damage.\nAnyone had the same problem?\n\n\nUPDATE: \n\n1. I found corrosion on Audio codec IC <CHIP>U6200</CHIP>, 5v on input but only 1.2v on output. The output should be 4.5v. \n2. I desolder <CHIP>U6200</CHIP> and one pin was broken under. I patched that pad back with solder. \n3. Since I don't have the same board or IC here I will order a new one and revert back with an update when I have. No point to look for short, since the IC was not outputting correct voltage, I can determine its the bad part. Meantime I post some images for everyone's reference."
