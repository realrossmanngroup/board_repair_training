Had to repair wire traces from pin 3 and 4 to pin 5 and 4 on <CHIP>U5420</CHIP>. The board worked at the point. But got returned a few months after with a new issue. Now the board requires smc reset before it will boot up. I would have to let is remained powered off for about an hour to be able to recreate the no power issue, at which point, i have to reperform smc reset to be able to power it again. \n\nI installed the board in another frame to confirm it wasn't the battery and i also replace the SMC with the same result. \n\nI can't recreate the issue unless the battery is connected. Once the board is out of the frame, it comes on all the time. \n\nAny suggestion on where to start?"

The board boots up without issue all the time when the battery is unplugged. \n\nAnd yes <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>BUF_SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> are steady high at 3.41v during the time when the unit won't boot. They both go to zero when I perform the smc reset as expected. \n\nNo corrosion on J6100 and pulled <CHIP>U8510</CHIP>, no corrosion. Went ahead and replaced <CHIP>U8510</CHIP> just in case. Same result. \n\nOne thing i did notice, not sure if this is something to be concerned about, but every line that runs off <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> has a diode mode reading of 0.381 compared to two know good boards reading of 0.469."
