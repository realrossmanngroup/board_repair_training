        "A1278_A3115B": "What is A1278_A3115B? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7200": "What is U7200? a CHIP.",
        "TPS51125": "What is TPS51125? This is a power chip responsible for the PP3V3_S5,  PP5V_S5,  and PP5V_S3 power rails on many A1278 model Macbooks.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "P5VS3_EN_L": "What is P5VS3_EN_L? P5VS3_EN_L is a signal that enables the PP5V_S3 power rail when it is low.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v..",

        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",
