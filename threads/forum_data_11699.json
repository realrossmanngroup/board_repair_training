When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

            "message": "I have this 15\" MBP Retina which says this is a 2016 version when I google the LB number. When I got it initially it would would not turn on with the battery plugged in so I had to unplug the battery, plug the charger in and hit the power button for it to turn on. The power button was kind of inconsistent. I was able to boot as guest user and plug the charger in and it said to \"replace now\".\n\nI got the new battery but before plugging it in I removed the logic board and put flux and heated the corroded areas of the keyboard connector as well as around <RESISTOR>R9192</RESISTOR>/<CHIP>U9600</CHIP>.\n\nThe <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> area around the battery current sensing were all damaged so I replaced the ISL along with all the caps/resistors on the right side(<CAPACITOR>C7101</CAPACITOR> to <RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR>).\n\nI had to use a schematic for an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3787</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> since I don't have a schematic for this model. I believe they are very similar judging by the donor board I am using.\n\nAfter all that I went to test this out. I plugged in the display cable, keyboard cable and the new battery and while I was in the process of plugging in the trackpad cable I started seeing smoke come from the SMC area and I quickly unplugged the battery. \nThings smelled burned and the keyboard backlight part was slightly melted right around the smc area which is why I know the smc was the fault.\n\nI removed the edge bonding and saw that Pin 2 of L5001 and Pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C5001</CAPACITOR> both have burned pads. Again I had to use a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3787</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> boardview to find that out and I am not sure where I can run a wire for those since the pad is gone.\n\nNow when I plug in a charger I get no light on the charger.\n\nI'm not sure why the SMC area would smoke up like that when there was no liquid damage around it nor did I do any repairs in that area. All I did was plug in a battery."

I didn't get to plug the trackpad cable in before it started smoking. \nI've never replaced an SMC before nor do I have the tools.
