There was some corrosion on the backlight circuit, on <CAPACITOR>C8475</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C8466</CAPACITOR> which I cleaned and re-soldered. At the moment when plugged in it goes to 20v and around 0.5-0.6 amps but then drops to 0.3amps and stays that way. On the thermal camera, <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> goes to the 40s-low 50s degrees, and also the CPU nearly 40, nothing else warms up. Even before I cleaned the corrosion there was no short anywhere and no other corrosion spots. Any idea?\n\nThanks :)"

I took out and re-soldered <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> and it powered on with just no backlight, the reason being the backlight cable was broken which I fixed and now it's all good :)\n\nThanks for the assistance  âœŒ :cool:"
