I'm not sure of the best way to go about this but rather than hijack my own thread or do all of that over again I'm going to just pick it up from that same spot and post the measurements for the new one.\nThe issue is no <SIGNAL>SLP_S4</SIGNAL> lines. Liquid-damage.\nHis last entry was: \"My suspect of SPI ROM data line is still the best guess. Remove ROM and measure all pins on diode mode.\" Here is the response for this new board:\n\n1. .590\n2. .495\n3. .506\n4. 0\n5. .519\n6. .519\n7. .511\n8 .406"
