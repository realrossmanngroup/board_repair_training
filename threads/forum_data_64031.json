            "message": "This 2018 Air came in with liquid damage in the area of the USB-C connector on the logic board. Pins 59 (20V) and 55 (Gnd) on the connector were visibly burnt, and a few nearby caps looked corroded (<CAPACITOR>C6405</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C6416</CAPACITOR>, CC711, <CAPACITOR>C3306</CAPACITOR>). \n\nAfter clean-up, USB is now stuck at 5V, drawing 0.08A. PPBUS is at 12.3V. I replaced both CD3215s, and I get all LDO voltages except for <SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC</SIGNAL> when plugging into port B. I replaced the Thunderbolt ROM (<CHIP>U2890</CHIP>) with no change.\n\nThe CC lines for port A (<SIGNAL>USBC_XA_CCX</SIGNAL>) are not what I see on a good board, while <SIGNAL>USBC_XB_CCX</SIGNAL> are correct. I checked resistances on the CC lines (in diode mode) and those are fine.\n\nWhat should I check next to find out why PP1V1 and <SIGNAL>USBC_XA_CCX</SIGNAL> are not working?"
