Readings were a little high compared to my reference board.   .7   instead of .5 so I replaced <CHIP>U8502</CHIP> and that didn't work.\n\nJust to be sure I checked a known good display and still no camera.   It does not even find the camera.  \n\nQuestion?\nso my T2 is toast?  How do I verify from here?  Junk it?"
