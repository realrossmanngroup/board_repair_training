It wasn't.\nso I diode tested against my reference board L8502 and L8503.   Readings were a little high compared to my reference board.   .7   instead of .5 so I replaced U8502 and that didn't work.\n\nJust to be sure I checked a known good display and still no camera.   It does not even find the camera.  \n\nQuestion?\nso my T2 is toast?  How do I verify from here?  Junk it?"}

No physical signs of damage.   Passives are all good.   No water damage. \nI probably need to put a scope on it.   U3900 I am sure is bad.   I wish we could change these"}
