            "message": "Hi All,  I need help.  This board has no backlight.  One backlight output capacitor blew out and shorted.  I've replaced it and still no backlight.  I test with another known good display from an iMac 27\" 2015 5k, but no backlight then test the original display in another iMac 2015 and the display is good.  So it's definitely the board.\n\nCan't find schematic for this board.   So I'm using schematic from 2015.\n\nMeasuring the output backlight caps, I get ~70V.  working backlight measure ~58V\n\nI took some measurement;\nFuse F4400 ~12V\nAt J8200;  Backlight boost pin 6 and 12 measure ~70V,  the others LED Returns are ~1.4V  ( here I saw other post about measuring pin 1-4, 2-5,3-6 at J8200 I don't understand this,  what this is)\n\nAt J4400 measurement;  Already replace lcd connector J4400\nPin60 BLC-EN-  3.3V\npin2-8- 12V\npin 19-20  <SIGNAL>SMB_DP_TCON_SLA_SDA</SIGNAL>/SCL present 3.3V\nPin 24 - <SIGNAL>DP_INTPNL_MLAUX_C_P</SIGNAL> measure  ~0.41 measurement from a good working unit is the same\nPin 25 - <SIGNAL>DP_INTPNL_MLAUX_C_N</SIGNAL> measure ~2.4 working unit is same value.\n\nPin 54 -  not getting anything on <SIGNAL>TCON_RESET_L</SIGNAL>  but not sure.  On working 2015 model this signal was there. But this 2019 model I'm not sure it should be here or not. \n\nAny help is most appreciate\n-Joe"

The measurement was unstable,  seems like it was jumping around,  maybe its the meter or not grounding right.     is there a correct way to measure these?  \n\nPlease disregard the measurement previous post  at j8200,  those were measurement for known good iMac 2015(1.4V which is  weird)\n\nDifferent backlight cable was used to test.  Use the whole display and cable from known good iMac 2015 model.\n\nYes I was using the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00134</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> schematic for reference."

You're the man.   \n\nFollowing your advise,  I start measuring the mosfets <TRANSISTOR>Q8201</TRANSISTOR>-9 and found they didn't have the 12V in pin 3 on them which was the <SIGNAL>PP12V_S0_BKLT_PWR</SIGNAL>.\nThis line came out of <TRANSISTOR>Q8119</TRANSISTOR> and there is a fuse before it,  F8100,  and this fuse was blown.  Replace it and backlight is good.  \n\nThere are two fuse with these 5K iMac,  one by the lcd connector, F4400 and one behind the board, F8100.  \n\nThanks a lot for the help 2informaticos!\n\nThis is solved."
