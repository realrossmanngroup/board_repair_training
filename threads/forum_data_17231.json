        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "R7704": "What is R7704? a RESISTOR.",
        "C7711": "What is C7711? a CAPACITOR.",

            "message": "This board had liquid damage in the area of the LCD Connector and had no backlight. I cleaned up the area and replaced all the components around it. Fortunately the other side of the board is spotless including the <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> area. I ended up having to replace the screen and I also replaced the LCD connector. Now I am getting 8.55v on Pins 3/4 of LCD connector and I can see the question mark folder. \nI noticed that <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> was 0.17v so I plugged the keyboard in and did a PRAM reset and it went up to around 1.6v. It seemed like the screen was less dim and I could see the question mark folder better. I tried putting the brightness up with the keyboard and that didn't work.\n\nI removed <RESISTOR>R7704</RESISTOR> and ran a wire to <CAPACITOR>C7711</CAPACITOR> and 3v now is on <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> but still 8.55v is on backlight.\n\nThis board is a little different from the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> so I'm not sure how I can check if the feedback trace is fine. The feedback ball and the entire chip look perfect. Here are some more measurements\n\n<CAPACITOR>C7799</CAPACITOR> in diode mode - 0.614v\nPin 1(<DIODE>D7701</DIODE>) in diode mode - 0.419v and Pin 2 is 0.614v\n<SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> - 2.85v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> - 3.4v\nThere is continuity from Pin 2 of <DIODE>D7701</DIODE> to Probe 1155 on the other side of the board"
