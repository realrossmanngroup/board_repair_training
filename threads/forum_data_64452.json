Green light but no fan spin. \n\n Replaced both. I got <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>P5V0S0_SS</SIGNAL> but no <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_FET_R</SIGNAL>.\n\nReplaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7860</TRANSISTOR> twice but still no <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_FET_R</SIGNAL>. Theres continuity between all points. Diode mode to ground on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_FET_R</SIGNAL> is 0.375 (same as good board)."
