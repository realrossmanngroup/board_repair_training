I did a cleaning but it was not successful. When I made measurements in reverse diode mode on the LDO signals, on all four controllers, I got:\n\nU3200\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD:         0.466V\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO:            0.517V\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC:   0.495V\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA:          0.501V\n\nU3100\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD:         0.469V\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO:            0.517V\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC:   0.499V\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA:          0.503V\n\nUB400\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD:         0.465V\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO:           0.517V\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC:  0.495V\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA:         0.502V\n\nUB300\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD:          0.471V\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO:            0.517V\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC:   0.504V\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA:          0.509V\n\n\nNext, I replaced U3200, Q3200, U3100, Q3100 (because they were oxidized too much initially) and also UB300, for presenting slightly altered values compared to the other chips. \nThe board turns on and the system goes up, but as initially, it does not show any activity in any of the four ports, and the keyboard does not work (probably because of the liquid, although I have not tested another). I can't get past the user login screen, because I can't type the password (because of the keyboard) and I can't use an external keyboard, because none of the four ports work. Sometimes, even on this screen, the machine restarts by itself and apparently generates an error report, but I can't see it because it is not possible to access the system.\n\nCan you help me with what measurements I should take? Thanks!"}
