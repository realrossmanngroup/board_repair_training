This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

            "message": "hi.\nSo I got this board cheep but working. Just needed some touch ups (KB connector, SPKR Connector) . So I carried out the deed and everything was OK (booting/chiming). I proceeded to clean the areas that had flux left on them with toothbrush and warm water/Branson mixture. Then dipped those parts in alcohol and lightly scrubbed. Afterward blew excess liquid off with air compressor and followed with light heat from hot air station. Went to trun it on and I only get 1 repeating fan spin. i have PPbus at 12.56, PP3v42 at 3.42V, <SIGNAL>PPVINVIN_S5_HS</SIGNAL> and all s5 rails. But all my s3 rails are cycling. Vcore not showing up.\nMy gut tells me I got some solution under PCH that didn't fully evaporate, but not sure what to do. I ran hot flux under it numerous times and changed SMC with no change.\n\nThanks, Have a better day than Im having!"

No scope at the moment.\nI do have an Ultrasonic, but Im not sure if I can trust it. It is a 180 dollar True Sonic. Havent used it much because I was suspicious that it may me doing more harm than good. But then again, now that I think of it maybe its because of the way I have been drying them. In your honest opinion, what do you think? Should I trust the True Sonic if I dry boards in oven?\nI did soak the board in heated solution Branson/Distilled water and cleaned with toothbrush followed by Alcohol bath. But thats it so far.\nI did change the clock chip.\nTo check frequency, is there a scope you can recommend that is not too pricey? Do I really need one? Will multimeter with frequency counter be sufficient? Sorry for the long reply, I just want to get this taken care of.\nAs I said, thanks for the help.\nHave a good one."
