        "message":"\"Small\" water spill on the keyboard. Keyboard flex was destroyed. There was a small spot (picture attached) around C7051 and Q7040. Cleaned around the two components. Replaced the flex cable and the machine boots, charges, and does boot into the OS.  Keyboard and touchpad work. \n\nWhen you first start the computer the CPU fan goes on and off about 10-15 times. If the battery is disconnected I have the fan issue but the computer runs normally. \n\nIf the battery is connected it charges, has the same fan issue, but after login the computer shuts off after a minute or so. \n\nOther than just replacing the two components is there a way to test which one is the culprit? I currently do not have a donor board for this model."
