Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

There was a small spot (picture attached) around <CAPACITOR>C7051</CAPACITOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR>. Cleaned around the two components. Replaced the flex cable and the machine boots, charges, and does boot into the OS.  Keyboard and touchpad work. \n\nWhen you first start the computer the CPU fan goes on and off about 10-15 times. If the battery is disconnected I have the fan issue but the computer runs normally. \n\nIf the battery is connected it charges, has the same fan issue, but after login the computer shuts off after a minute or so. \n\nOther than just replacing the two components is there a way to test which one is the culprit? I currently do not have a donor board for this model."
