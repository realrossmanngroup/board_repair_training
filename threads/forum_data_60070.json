        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "R1430": "What is R1430? a RESISTOR.",
        "C8324": "What is C8324? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C8325": "What is C8325? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "Q7707": "What is Q7707? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. ."

Noticed <CAPACITOR>C8325</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C8324</CAPACITOR> were removed from the board so replaced those - but now I'm getting no image and no backlight.\n\nI've measured the following which should help.\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR>:\n2- 3.3v\n3- 8v\n4, 5 and 6 - 0v\n\nFrom this have noticed pin 5 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> is linked with <RESISTOR>R1430</RESISTOR>, checked resistance and got 99.8K. Is pin 5 meant to be the same as pin 2 to open the gate?\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>\nPin 3 and 4 - 8.2v\nAll other pins are 0v\n\nDiode mode of L7701 shows 390 on either side, <DIODE>D7701</DIODE> shows 390 on pin 1 and 590 on pin 2.\n\nAny assistance on this would be much appreciated.\n\nEdit: I know this screen is a good working screen as I've been using it on multiple boards for testing and it displays fine."

I can't check until Monday now though, and yeah I understand pin 5 being 0v shows there is no backlight and thats why I checked with <RESISTOR>R1430</RESISTOR> to see if that was damaged in any way. If I'm looking at the schematics correctly, <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> gets created by the CPU/PCH? \n\nHow would I go ahead and test the image related issues as I'm not getting any image even from shining a torch behind the apple logo on the lid, nothing at all. CPU gets hot to the touch with heatsink off and pulls roughly 0.8A making me think it's booting up.\n\nBut as stated I can definitely confirm this isn't a bad screen as it works on every board I've got working."
