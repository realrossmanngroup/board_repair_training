        "A1286": "What is A1286? A1286 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2009 , Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2255, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2330, 820-2532, 820-2523, 820-2533, 820-2850, 820-2915, 820-3330..",
        "820-3330B": "What is 820-3330B? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U9600": "What is U9600? a CHIP.",
        "U9270": "What is U9270? a CHIP.",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "LCD_PWR_EN": "What is LCD_PWR_EN? LCD_PWR_EN is a signal that tells the chip that supplies power to the LCD screen to turn on..",
        "LCD_BKLT_PWM": "What is LCD_BKLT_PWM? LCD_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "GMUX_S3_PD_GND": "What is GMUX_S3_PD_GND? a SIGNAL.",
        "DP_MUX_EN": "What is DP_MUX_EN? a SIGNAL.",

        "820-2915": "What is 820-2915? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15” Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",
