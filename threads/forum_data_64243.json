This is the 2nd possible board i have in storage and could use for this old device but it has a strange issue. The device has 2 drives. 1 SSD and instead of an ODD a 2nd HDD. macOS is on both. If i install macOS (Snow Leopard) on the HDD it takes around 90 mins which is really slow. If i swap the board (having the same model with sleep issue - other post...) and leave everything else the same it completes the installation on the same drive in 30 mins. It also needs forever to shut down or restore data from an image. On the SSD i dont feel any slowdowns. Both drives are new... I have no clue where to start on this one..."}
