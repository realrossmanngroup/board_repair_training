Everyting works but the screen began to flicker, on the right side its a grey bar but you can still see the desktop. So bascially i thought its a dead screen, but one time after a SMC / PRAM reset the screen worked like a charm but went back to flicker a few minutes later.\n\nIs there something i can measure to be sure its a dead screen? <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2141</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> is not known for Flexgate Issues right?\n\n[ATTACH]60438[/ATTACH]"
