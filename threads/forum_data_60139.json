            "message": "I have on the bench an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with a power on issue. The customer told me that it would charge but not turn on so they replaced the battery. They said the owner used it for a bit but it started acting up so they replaced the battery again. I measured the G3H rails with only battery plugged in and it has those but when I trigger <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> and measure voltage on pin 7 of <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>, the voltage drops then recovers when I release the power button as I think it should. <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> behaves the same way. sits at 3.3V until the power button is pressed, drops to .4V then recovers once I let the button go, but the computer will only turn on when I plug MS in. The laptop will shutdown with the power button pressed but will not come on. I attempted an SMC reset but no change. Is it safe to say I have an SMC issue? BTW there are no signs of liquid damage, no corrosion or anything. I will check <RESISTOR>R5116</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5100</RESISTOR>, as well as <RESISTOR>R7100</RESISTOR>. I see that <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> also goes to J6100 but. I didn't see anything there."
