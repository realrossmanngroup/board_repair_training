There are also red indicators showing there had been moisture around the board, but corrosion is pretty much non-existent - looked everywhere. The MacBook turns on, but gets stuck on the Apple progress bar, almost reaching the end, but never booting to the macOS. There is a high fan spin also.\n\nWhat I did so far is replace the battery, because it was shot and not running off it.\n\nWhere do I even begin? Help, thanks!"
