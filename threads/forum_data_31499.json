(Samsung MZ-JPV128S) Its always the same two resistors, one or both missing.\nThe thing is the SSD seem to work fine without them, passing diagnostics and performing normally.\nCan someone shed some light on what's going on here?  Are they unused vestiges of higher density SSD's?  Will it effect reliability or performance in any way?\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"30%\"]31500._xfImport[\/ATTACH]"}
