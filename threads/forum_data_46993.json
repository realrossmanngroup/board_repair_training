So i pulled the chip and extracted the bios from it and confirmed that the serial number was present. So, decide to try a different bios file. while trying to flash the bios chip with a bios from another machine using MedUSA it got locked at 18% and now the board is running (haven't tested with a display, but it chimes on). Not confident that it's fully fixed and now I can't read the chip using the medusa.\n\nGoing to refresh the chip with a clean bios file"
