        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWGD? This is a typo of ALL_SYS_PWRGD. When you see ALL_SYS_PWGD, assume they meant to type ALL_SYS_PWRGD.",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

I put the board in a ultra sonic cleaner, now i clean but can start, just fan and stop.\ni change the SMC, <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> (because <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is low 12,26, now 12,57). i try the board with original charger 85W.\nI have the <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWGD</SIGNAL>=3,34V just few seconds and fall when fan stop.\n<CHIP>U7000</CHIP> 17/18=3ohm and 27/28=20ohm\ndo you have any idea, where i can find the problem?\nthanks"
