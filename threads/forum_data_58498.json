I put the board in a ultra sonic cleaner, now i clean but can start, just fan and stop.\ni change the SMC, U7000 (because PPBUS_G3H is low 12,26, now 12,57). i try the board with original charger 85W.\nI have the all_SYS_PWGD=3,34V just few seconds and fall when fan stop.\nU7000 17\/18=3ohm and 27\/28=20ohm\ndo you have any idea, where i can find the problem?\nthanks"}
