        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",

        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "PCH_INTRUDER_L": "What is PCH_INTRUDER_L? PCH_INTRUDER_L is a signal that tells the machine the case has been opened by an intruder when it is low, the _L means it is present when it is low. This signal should always be high in a Macbook since it doesn’t use intrusion detection. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",
        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",
