            "message": "Hi, \n\nI got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01987</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board with a short in <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND</SIGNAL>. I know its a night mare but wanted to try. Also I have the donor parts so first removed <CHIP>U8600</CHIP> Still 2.5 ohm on <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND</SIGNAL>. Then removed <CHIP>U8700</CHIP> and the short was gone. So wanted to only replace these two nand chips but read that you have to change all 4 as a set. So removed <CHIP>U8800</CHIP> and <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> to. Checked if <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND</SIGNAL> is there but still nothing after shirt was gone. \n\nFigured out that PP2v5 is not being created beacause <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> was dead. Replaced it and all SSD/Nand power lines came active. Got the NAND chips from my donor and after reballing and cleaning everything. Got the chips on the exact same order back on my board. (had to do one 3 times because when I placed it I got a short!?!, figured out I had my schematic upside down (felt MEGA stupid, wasted 2 hours)) \n\nNow I know I have to restore T2 data. First DFU mode attempt failed. Board stuck at 20v, 0,046a. Second attempt again failed but board was almost booting. 20v, 0,6amp. Looks like I'm almost there. Fan spin and cpuvcore is 0,825V But does not go down. Stays at 0,825V This means not booting. Can someone Help? \n\nI was thinking something of bios? It doesn't boot... And how can I be shore NAND is correctly placed?"
