There is no short circuit.\nCould you show me on schematics what voltage should I get from which part? e.g. \"You need to get 5 volts on first leg of c7522. \"\nWhat do you mean by SUS voltages?

Can you tell me this way? If you give me this information as if you need to read 5 volts on the 1st leg of the L7510, I will check it and write to you and we will progress better. L7595 I'm sorry I misspelled it will be L7095 I read 3.3 volts on the 1st and 2nd leg.When I first give power to the motherboard, it pulls to 0.30 and drops to 00.2 and stays there and does not turn on.\nL7520 has no voltage on P\u0130N 1 P\u0130N 2"}
