        "message":"Hi Guys I have an 820-01700 Core i9 with a high fan spin. I have tried to change the fan but still the same. Checked all lines going to the fan no shorts there. Any other component that can cause this? The Mac works fine, temp reading and all are good and its fast, just fan running max speed and even with Mac fan control I am not ably to turn it lower. SMC issue maybe?\n\nDid some measurement and found that FAN_LT_PWM is 0.6v and FAN_RT_PWM 2.5v maybe an issue there? I do not know what it should be, but seems to be too big of a difference? Also tried another trackpad with cable but same."
