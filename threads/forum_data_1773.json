If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",

            "message": "[COLOR=#333333][FONT=Verdana][SIZE=13px]So this board was liquid damaged although I saw no signs of liquid damage on the board itself, i cleaned it anyways. The machine boots up and chimes just fine, has all main power rails ect. The only issue is the board isn't recognizing any keyboard input from the internal keyboard. I have tried a new internal keyboard as well as a new trackpad together and neither have made a difference. Also an external keyboard does seem to work perfectly fine its only the internal one. Ideas on anything that could cause this? The machine DOES react to an SMC reset but wont alt-boot when I try to boot from a bootable or get to the boot menu. Also, The caps lock light on the keyboard does not turn on at all when pressed. 3.3v on all caps near the USB controller. <RESISTOR>R5710</RESISTOR> is 1 kohms and <CAPACITOR>C5710</CAPACITOR> has 1.3v which seems to be pretty normal. Not really sure where to go from here. Any tips?[/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]"

I might have measured it right as i plugged it in last time so i could have got an inaccurate reading, my bad.. Also <RESISTOR>R5710</RESISTOR> has 3.4v on both pins and the trackpad does indeed work. No lag and the fan spins normally which leads me to believe it was good however I tried a new one anyways just to make sure. I also have tested more than 1 keyboard to rule out the possibility of a bad part"
