But it gives only with some chargers a green light and sometimes it won´t start at all until i remove the Battery. But if i plug the battery back in it works normally for some time until after a few hours or sometimes days it is dead again until i remove the Battery again. This even happens if i have the Keyboard unplugged. Any ideas what could cause this?\nThanks for any help"

After i cleaned it it seems to charge with every Charger but still won´t start if a battery is plugged in (green light stays on / just not booting). Even if i send it to sleep with a battery plugged in it won´t wake up. But without battery everything works fine. If it would be a battery current sensing issue would the green light in the charger be on?"

If i disconnect the Keyboard/Trackpad cable from the board it runs better i think. I can wake it up from standby and it also starts often with battery attached. But if i shut it down and try to turn it back on (without Trachpad cable but with akku attached i plug in the charger ) it sometimes again won´t start until i unplug the battery. Once unplugged it can be started just with the charger or i can plug the battery instantly back in and it also can be startet with battery attached. Can this be a battery issue?"

But anyways it looks like the trackpad (and cable) exchange did the trick. It started normally every time i pressed the power button today (i don´t know it it resets the smc as the battery is 100% full now and the light stays green all the time but i think it dosn´t). \nAgain thank you very much. You guys and this whole Forum are awsome!:)"
