When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution.

Fans stay on for 4-5secs and loop. The <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> jumps from 3.4 to 13.6V when the fans are on.\n\nAll voltages except <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL> rise when the fans spin and turn off again (LCD is disconnected though).\n\nI have no history on this except the fact that someone else replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> which I also replaced just to be sure. I did measure some funky resistors around it but replaced all of them with proper values.\n\nClock crystals seem in order and <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> seems alive (any pointers how to properly measure this one?)\n\nAny clues?\n\nbr,\ngeorge"

            "message": "glad you take me back to the basics cause we sometimes take them for granted. Although I measured the resistors separately and even changed one, I did not measure the whole thing. One line was cut from <RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR> (0 ohm) to <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR>. I moved <RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR> to the single pad just off its original place (to avoid any weird path resistance of some MOhms) and run a wire from its other end to the F7040-1. It worked.\n\ncheers dude - virtual beer(s) from me - unless you find yourself to Thessaloniki."
