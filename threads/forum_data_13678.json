Minor liquid exposure and some corrosion noticed in the area just to the right of the battery connector on board.  Is this worth attempting repair?  Should we do testing to pinpoint what components need to be replaced?  Thanks for any help."

        "message":"Hey Duke I have watched most of Louis' videos and searched elsewhere as well.  I try not to ask about the elementary stuff, but could you point me in the right direction to learn the best way to check for pp3v42 and other power rails?  This is a 820-3115 and I have checked at C7040 and gotten .9, .843 with the voltage slowly dissipating.  I have tried one different DC-in jack but that seems to make no change.  Earlier today I got a solid green light on that stayed on, but I can't seem to get that again, since then i have gotten a green light for like a second another time, but now its back to no green light at all.  I have not replaced any components yet but 3 or 4 of the surrounding caps do not beep out.  I did remove the sponge you mentioned covering a shorted cap.  it doesn't show any signs of additional damage.  Any help is appreciated.  If I am asking too much and you think I should do the one on one training just tell me, but I would like to learn as much as I can without having to travel to NYC.  Thanks again."
