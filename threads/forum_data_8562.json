        "message":"Greetings.  I have an 820-2879 board with high fan.  Diagnostics showed no bad sensor and system also does not show any slow down.  All seems to work well otherwise.  All measures well around fan connector (R5660, R5661, R6556). I replaced Q5660 just to cover my bases.  I replaced trackpad also but no luck.  Any thoughts on where to look next?\n\nPaul"
