Diagnostics showed no bad sensor and system also does not show any slow down.  All seems to work well otherwise.  All measures well around fan connector (<RESISTOR>R5660</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R5661</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R6556</RESISTOR>). I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q5660</TRANSISTOR> just to cover my bases.  I replaced trackpad also but no luck.  Any thoughts on where to look next?\n\nPaul"
