He did not removed the battery and as he want to plug it in he saw a spark on J4802 (the corrosponding connector at the trackpad - not at the board). So i guess he shorted PPVIN_S4_Tpad to GND. Now its dead and missing PM_SLP_S5_L and i dont really know where to start. The first missing rail is PP5V_S4 not enabled by PM_SLP_S5_L..."}

Its also not turning on in SMC bypass mode. \nI also talked to the customer and he said that the charger was not attached but maybe it was just sleeping not turned off as he changed the cable. That would explain the spark on J4802.\nI checked the resistances of all rails as i could fix a few boards by comparing resistance values with other good boards and i think i found some shorts there. I did not checked these rails before as PP5V_S4 was the first missing rail and it is not shorted... The following resistance values seem to low to me:\n\nPP3V3_SUS: 380 Ohm (i would expect kOhms here)\nPP3V3_S3: 1.1 Ohm\nPP3V3_S0: 1.2 Ohm\nPP3V3_S0_FET: 0.8 Ohm\nPP1V05_S0: 0.9 Ohm\n\nI am not sure how they all can go bad (maybe the short was on PP3V3_S4_TPAD killing other 3V3 rails?!) and where they all are connected to each other but eg. PP1V05_S0 shorted would mean that the PCH is not turning on and explain why SLP_Sx_L signals are not pulsing."}
