        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",

        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",

        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",

        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",
