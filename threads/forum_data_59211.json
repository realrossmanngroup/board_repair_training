SSD have HFS. About history of this computer i know that customer put in this bad adapter with this ssd (photos). After this operation, Macbook don't recognizing any SSD in J4501.\n\n<SIGNAL>SSD_P3V3S0_EN</SIGNAL> - 3,34V\n<SIGNAL>SSD_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 3,34V\nPP3V3 S0 SSD FLT - 3,34\n\nThis is my first topic, if I do something wrong, please correct me."
