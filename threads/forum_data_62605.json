In question I have this model <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with pcb <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A, the device when connected to the power supply emits green and then orange light (even if the battery is disconnected), the fan runs but does not emit an image, nor back-up to the monitor. I tried to connect it to an external monitor by disconnecting the internal monitor, but with no results.\nI checked all the voltages named Power Aliases on page 62 of the schematic, and I don't have the voltage on this line <SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>.....but the initial \"BOING\" sound not heard.\nsorry for my english but i used a translator, do you have any help or ideas regarding my problem?"
