            "message": "I had a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00164</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> return bite me today.  It came back with no MagSafe light.  The original repair was trace repair around LVDS and SMC rework.    Usually before I remove a SMC when I have a SMC problem that is not a short in the SMC I heat it until it reflows and bump it a little to jiggle the balls and that fixes it.  I have had a few of these come back and if I jiggle it again and reflow it works.  This time I pulled the SMC and noticed a oxidized pad that was grey on the SMC.  I cleaned and touched up that pad and reflowed the chip.  It is working once again but I am not sure I trust it.\n\nHave you seen this before and what is your usual repair when this is encountered?"
