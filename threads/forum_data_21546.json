Had damage to <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> area - shorted pins 23&24 17&18 - after some diagnosis removed <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and shorts have gone away.\nProblem is i've only got <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3536</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> donor boards and the <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> seems to have different pin placement. Does anyone know of any other boards that this chip exists on ?\nThanks!"

( i knew that the were ram differences between 3537 and 3476 but didn't know about the <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR>) - yes <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> got changed too - pins 23&24 were burnt out and <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> had shorted to ground. Its now charging and ready for final testing. Please mark as solved."
