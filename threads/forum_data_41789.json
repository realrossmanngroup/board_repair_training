        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."
