            "message": "First time post here - I'm relatively new at board repair in general.\n\nAs the title says, I've got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B that won't power on.  I get an orange light on the charger and no fan spin.\n\nWith a visual inspection, I found corrosion on <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> and components in close proximity.\n\nI have tried quite a few things, but since I'm not even sure that I could remember all of the things I've tried so far, I'm going to just list out where things stand currently, things that I know of at least.\n\nVoltage readings:\n(In no certain order)\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 8.57V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.42V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> at L7520 - 0.89V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> at <RESISTOR>R5590</RESISTOR> Pin 1 - 3.34V\nL7310 - 0V\n\nVoltage readings around <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>:\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> - <CAPACITOR>C1910</CAPACITOR> - 3.41V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> - <RESISTOR>R2040</RESISTOR> - 3.33V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> - <RESISTOR>R2041</RESISTOR> - 1.78V\n\nOther possibly related voltage readings:\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> - <RESISTOR>R8179</RESISTOR> - 0.80V\n<SIGNAL>S4_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> - <RESISTOR>R8177</RESISTOR> - 0.00V\n<SIGNAL>P5VS4RS3_EN</SIGNAL> - <RESISTOR>R8176</RESISTOR> - 0.80V\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> - <RESISTOR>R8115</RESISTOR> - 0.00V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN</SIGNAL> - <CHIP>U8170</CHIP> - 0.00V\n\n\n\nAlso, in case it's relevant, the CPU gets hot.  I've tested and tried a lot of different things, but since I am new at this, please don't assume that I haven't overlooked something.\nAny help and advice will be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n*Edit** Reading over this again, this looks like a total plz bro type of post which wasn't my intention.  I have looked up, or at least attempted to figure out, where the missing/low lines originate and how the different rails get created.  My brain is just complete mush right now from working on this for at least 6-7 hours so far."

I then went to the other nearby and possibly related/relevant mosfet's and did the same, and near <CHIP>U8030</CHIP>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_FET_R</SIGNAL> gave a very low diode mode reading, somewhere around .040, and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> was .025.  So I removed <CHIP>U8030</CHIP> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_FET_R</SIGNAL> now reads 0.366, but <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> still reads .025.   I still didn't remove <CHIP>U8010</CHIP> yet until I told you what I found with this, to see if you wanted me to go ahead and remove it for sure."
