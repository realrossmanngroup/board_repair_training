I had no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> but I removed corroded capacitor and got 3.3V on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>. The problem is I plug in the charger to every single port and it takes 5v, 30-50 milliamps, and turns off. And the cycle repeats. For the 3 seconds its on, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.3V. Right before it turns off, PPDCIN turns to 19.89V before turning off again. I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> as it had a bit of corrosion on it. Pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> goes to a test point that was corroded and is completely gone. However, this test point is not on the boardview. I have also replaced <CHIP>U2890</CHIP> from a donor, and still no luck. Any ideas?"
