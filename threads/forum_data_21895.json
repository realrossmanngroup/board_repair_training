        "820-2914": "What is 820-2914? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U9600": "What is U9600? a CHIP.",
        "PBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_EN_DIV": "What is PBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_EN_DIV? a SIGNAL.",
        "R9840": "What is R9840? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q9807": "What is Q9807? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

Some one worked on this board before us and connected <SIGNAL>PBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_EN_DIV</SIGNAL> to direct ground so when machine turn on direct start LCD backlight and when sleep computer LCD backlight not turning off. ( but machine working normally) \n\nI checked enable signal its 1.1V its too low. removed <TRANSISTOR>Q9807</TRANSISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R9840</RESISTOR> its same value. This signal comes from <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> but i want to ask , can i create fake Backlight enable signal for turn backlight on when machine working normal and turn off when computer sleep?"

            "message": "The first thing to do is ensure that <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is its proper 3.3-.3.4v. As low as 2.9-3.0v and I have had backlight issues before, which is odd, as the manual states 0.5v as the [I]\"lid closed\"[/I] point. Oddly enough - 2.9v on <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> will[I]NOT [/I]put the machine to sleep, but it has turned off the backlight for me. I could be wrong as from memory, even when <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> was artificially low, I had 19-22v on backlight output, implying that <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> was opening.\n\nOnce that's done and we've confirmed the sad truth that the mux is probably bad, you could tie <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> to <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> with a 10k resistor inbetween. This way it would only be on when the machine is in an S0 state; in an S3 state <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> will not be present so no more sleeping LCD backlight.\n\n<SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> will go low when the display backlight is supposed to turn off. The proper fix for this would be replacing the mux but considering the work involved in doing this, and that the GPU will die in two months anyway, the ghetto fix may be the worthwhile one."
