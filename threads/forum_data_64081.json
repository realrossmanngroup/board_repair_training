I have replaced U3200 and check all traces\/resistors in the area. Everything measures good.\n\nThere seems to be a issue with PP3V3_G3H at C3200. Diode mode measures 0.581 on C3200 however measures normally at C3100 at 0.340. Amp Meter does not light up when trying to use U3200 . C3200 was replaced but no change.\n\nWhat should be checked next??"}
