This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

            "message": "Hey all, have a water damaged board that has no backlight. There wasn't any corrosion or red pads when I got it, and it doesn't look like anyone has tried working on it. I verified that there's a display, just no backlight.\n\nF9700 was blown, so I replaced it, and now get a green light but no power. I'm getting a short to ground somewhere along the line now.\n\nIf I remove <RESISTOR>R0910</RESISTOR>, since it's before the <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> line for <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> but doesn't remove <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL>, it powers on just fine. But that means that it'll boot when I kill <SIGNAL>PPBUS_SW_BKL</SIGNAL>. All the caps seem to be fine from there to the LCD connector J9000, but something is obviously shorting. What is the SW0 and SW1 do?"
