Board is pretty clean\n\nI have all the power rails including vcore.\nFan spins for 5 sec then stop and spins for ever.\n\nClock chip signals are fine  but replace the clock chip, SMC, test with different bios to see whether it chimes still same behaviour. Put back the original bios.\n\nCheck current sense resistors and they all good and measurements are fine.\n\nalso No light on usb mouse.\n\nAny adivice greatly appreciate."}

Still behave the same way fan spins for 5,6 secs and fan runs for ever with vcore present no chime no video no usb response. So fa I replaced SMC\/ Bios\/ PCH\/ RTC\/U1950."}
