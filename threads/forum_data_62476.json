        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",

But if i disconnect the power adapter and connect again stop working, no light, on charger.\nSo summarizing:\nWith battery works ok but no charging\nWithout battery: i must release residual electric or wait about 5 minutes or shorcut the main 14.5v -> plug in charger, and works. If i disconnect the charger, and plug in again no works till release the residual electricity, and i dont have any voltage on connector or main rail."
