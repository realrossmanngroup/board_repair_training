            "message": "The computer was working fine and then one of the charging data lines was shorted by corrosion on the battery connector that a tech didn't notice. The battery actually worked for a while then failed. The ISL was damaged and shorted internally by it. The computer still worked but didn't recognize the battery anymore. I replaced the chip and now get around 5V on PPBUS. Magsafe is on. 3V42 line is fine. I tried another ISL chip with the same result. I've check all the pins. Everything is good. Both sets of current sense lines are measuring fine. I'm thoroughly baffled. Any ideas?"

Do not connect a charger with the ISL removed.\nCheck resistance between pins 17/18 27/28 and <RESISTOR>R7105</RESISTOR>?\nAlso big chance the SMC is dead, usually when the ISL dies the SMC goes too. Green/orange light still present?"
