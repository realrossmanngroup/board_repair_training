(Which is not enabled so probably about 0V)\n\nYou can't really see if the clock is working properly by checking it with a multimeter, best to use is a oscilloscope or if you have a fancy multimeter it might be able to show the clock frequency (But most multimeters won't go above the Khz's)\n\nSince the USB mouse lights up I'm having some doubts that it could be U1900, but it was worth checking. Any idea of there was liquid around that area?\nHave you checked the SPI termination resistors?\n\nMaybe Duke has a better idea though, lets see what he has to say :)"}
