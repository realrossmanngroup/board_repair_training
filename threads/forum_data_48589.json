If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

I cleaned that and now it only starts if there is no monitor attached to it (internal and external). It i plug any monitor in fan just twitch once every time i press the power button. Without a screen it chimes but turns off after ~20 seconds. It beeps without ram and also stays on beeping forewer without ram (not turning off like it does with ram - i tested every combination of the two sticks in both slots and also one of mine - everytime with the same result.). If i \"trick\" it by starting it and instantly plugging in a external monitor after it chimed it shows a white screen but turns off same way as if there is no screen at all. I tested a known good LCD and it still wont start with the LCD connected. I measured all Pins of J9000 in diode mode and compared it betreen screen plugged in, screen unplugged and  a working board (with screen plugged in and also unplugged) and i cant find any differences. So i am stuck."

I measured without LCD and there are just 2,5 V at <DIODE>D3890</DIODE> (both sides - diode mode measurement > 0,5 V at both sides - no short). That should be 12.6 V (if not boosting) or 0 V if i am right. Also i would expect it to be 0 V with <RESISTOR>R3881</RESISTOR> removed. With <RESISTOR>R3881</RESISTOR> back in place i get 12,6 V at the top of the voltage divider, 8,4 V at <SIGNAL>TBT_DIV_L</SIGNAL> and ~6 V at Pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R3881</RESISTOR> (i expected that to be 0 V). So i came to <TRANSISTOR>Q3805</TRANSISTOR> and the enable is 0 V. To be sure i am not out of mind here i removed <TRANSISTOR>Q3880</TRANSISTOR> (as you suggested) and i still get 2,5 V at <SIGNAL>PPVIN_SW_T29BST</SIGNAL> and i cant understand where that voltage is coming from... But also with <TRANSISTOR>Q3881</TRANSISTOR> removed board wont start with lcd plugged in...\nAlso i wrote down all parts that had corrosion on them as i got the board. Heres the list maybe that helps.\n\n\n<CHIP>U3890</CHIP>\n<TRANSISTOR>Q5480</TRANSISTOR>\n<CHIP>U4900</CHIP>\n<RESISTOR>R2570</RESISTOR>\n<DIODE>D9498</DIODE>\n<CHIP>U7542</CHIP>\n<CHIP>U4582</CHIP>\n<CHIP>U5701</CHIP>\n<CHIP>U7200</CHIP>\n\n\n<CHIP>U3890</CHIP> is one of them.
