No short to ground but after checking further i see that it comes from PM_SLP_S3_L, it is 0v not enabling u8180 to open. I have 3v3 s5 on pin 5 as always i get confused with this pm_slp output signals is this bad U1100 or something else is stopping it from outputting this signal."}

[\/QUOTE]\n\nOnly history i know is that someone else tried to work on the board, but when it got into my hands it had a short on ppbus, I remember you told me that the cpu usually dies. The short was on U7320 i did not think the short would go away so i replaced the chip and it did ppbus is stable but those signals are still missing."}

Mark as solved I waste no more time."}
