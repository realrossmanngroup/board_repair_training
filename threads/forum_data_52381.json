        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15” Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "LVDS_IG_PANEL_PWR": "What is LVDS_IG_PANEL_PWR? a SIGNAL.",
        "LVDS_IG_BKL_ON": "What is LVDS_IG_BKL_ON? LVDS_IG_BKL_ON is equivalent to LCD_BKLT_EN. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
