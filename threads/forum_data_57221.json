It started few times loading untill desktop, worked ok but now sometimes it boots, sometimes make fan quarter and not booting, and now doesnt even boot. Checked all s5 lines and seems to be ok. Also changed <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> because it was badly damaged with some components near around,\n\n\nGetting <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS</SIGNAL> 3.3 V but still not booting. If do smc by pass also booting sometimes other times not booting. Board has it's own life.\n\nISL625 also ok pins 17/18 3,5 Ohms 27/28 20 ohms\n\n\nWhat can i check???"
