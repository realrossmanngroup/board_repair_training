You guys told me to replace <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR>... i tried that when i reassembled the unit had no back light. Im not sure if its relevant but maybe i installed the wrong kind of capacitor... or i messed something up while reassembling the unit? Eitherway i tried troubleshooting this but i dont know where to start the issue now is i have no backlight. I tryed a new lcd no dice."
