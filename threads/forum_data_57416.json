            "message": "Device came in liquid damaged and had missing R701 to CPUVIN and RA603 to <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0_GFXIMVP_VIN</SIGNAL>. Replaced and device boots up normally now. Performed a QC test and gave USC. Everything was working normally with board loosely installed. After screwing down logic board screws to frame, The touchbar stopped working. Unscrewed logicboard screw next to Left Hall Sensor and touchbar came back. Was unable to find anything grounding out board, so I assumed Left Hall sensor was bad. Replaced and still had the same issue.\n\nInstalled board into a known good topcase with a different touch bar and still had the same issue.\n\nWhen I boot the board with the original topcase, touchbar is no longer working at all now. Tried booting into safe mode and a USB test os and still had the same issues.\n\nMeasured voltage on J4401 and J4402 and getting 1.8 on <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0SW_DFR</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_RESET_L</SIGNAL>. Seems like device is getting proper power but perhaps a data line is missing?\n\nPull up resistors for <SIGNAL>DFRDRV_I2C_SDA</SIGNAL> <RESISTOR>R3918</RESISTOR> and <SIGNAL>DFRDRV_I2C_SCL</SIGNAL> <RESISTOR>R3917</RESISTOR> both measuring proper resistance of 4.7k ohms\nPull up resistors for <SIGNAL>DFR_TOUCH_ROM_I2C_SDA</SIGNAL> <RESISTOR>R3916</RESISTOR> and <SIGNAL>DFR_TOUCH_ROM_I2C_SCL</SIGNAL> <RESISTOR>R3917</RESISTOR> measuring 2.2k ohms\n\nGetting 0V on <SIGNAL>DFR_TOUCH_LID</SIGNAL>, which from my understanding is suppose to be 0V when <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.42v on <TRANSISTOR>Q4400</TRANSISTOR>\n\nNot quite sure where to go from here. Thank you in advance."
