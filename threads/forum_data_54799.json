        "A1707": "What is A1707? A1707 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3072, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00281, 820-00928..",
        "820-00281": "What is 820-00281? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U9850": "What is U9850? a CHIP.",
        "U8510": "What is U8510? a CHIP.",
        "5V_S0SW_LCD": "What is 5V_S0SW_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "DP_INT_HPD_R": "What is DP_INT_HPD_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN? EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is necessary to enable the power rail that powers the LCD screen image circuitry. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed â€“ if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
