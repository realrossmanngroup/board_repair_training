So i opened her up to inspect around smc_lid_r and found few components are burnt out and corroded.\n\non the J5250 there is a small cap which was badly corroded. I looked on schematics and couldnt find the specifications on it. Does anyone know or can help me so I can replace it?\n\nThanks"}

Perhaps there's a continuity break to the SMC? What voltage do you get on SMC_LID when open, vs when closed?\n\nWhat's the diode-mode value of the line? (red to ground)."}
