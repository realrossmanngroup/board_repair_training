        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

So i opened her up to inspect around <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_R</SIGNAL> and found few components are burnt out and corroded.\n\non the J5250 there is a small cap which was badly corroded. I looked on schematics and couldnt find the specifications on it. Does anyone know or can help me so I can replace it?\n\nThanks"
