It says:\n\nLocation :        IHSC\nType:               Current\nlow-limit:          0.0 A\nhigh-limit:        0.05A\ndescription:     Debug TBT T29 current\nreading            0.825 (more or less, sometimes 0.832, sometimes 0,822...)\nnoise-tolerance:  1.0\n\nSo I supposed this sensor is the cause of kernel panics, but I can't find why it gives me that value. I have looked for any broken trace or something strange near UD250 but can't find anything.. What should I look? Thank you!"}

Am I right? I'm still learning, and I have so much to learn,.. I already reflowed u8900. If I remove q3880, what should happen?\nI'll do it ASAP"}

Schematics say u9600 but I can't find it on brd. I already removed Q3880 and EFI hardware profile reads the same. 0,819A on that sensor. Something that I forgot to say is the board starts always, but when I shutdown it, it won't turn on again at the moment, I have to wait a few minutes.. but if I disconnect battery it seems to turn on faster. It's very strange.."}
