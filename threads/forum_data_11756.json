        "message":"Another shop sent me an 820-4924 that they tried to flash the bios on but failed. The chip was missing so I pulled one off a donor board and put it in my TL866 to program with a new ME region. However, once I dumped it it looks like junk -- no serial number or \"hwc\" anywhere.\n\nDoes anybody have a clean 820-4924 bios? Or is this normal for the new boards?\n\nDump: [url]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0BwIAaoowgCg6VXZIRU5lbjVoOE0\/view?usp=sharing[\/url]"
