            "message": "I've got a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A with trackpad click, but no trackpad movement, keyboard response, or caps lock light. The power button functions and can trigger SMC bypass mode, which does not help the situation, but the keyboard is otherwise unresponsive to startup combinations and the device will not enter recovery mode. The logic board shows no signs of liquid damage, but is a bit \"crummy and dusty\", I'm currently wondering about crap under the SMC but unsure if the lack of improvement in bypass mode rules this out. The keyboard connector looks good, and no pins are loose. An external mouse / keyboard functions just fine.\n\nI am aware of the frequent trackpad flex failures on this model, A new top case, keyboard, trackpad, and trackpad flex assembly did not change anything.\n\nI've seen several instances of this exact board and problem set over the years and often come up empty handed despite testing and replacing everything I could think of, and read some threads here with the exact same symptoms but no resolution. Any ideas as to what might be behind this issue?"
