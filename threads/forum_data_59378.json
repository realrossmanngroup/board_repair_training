        "message":"Hello. I got another 820-00239 that is not liquid damaged but just randomly stopped turning on. It was taking 20v 0.03a when I first plugged it in and I found that PPBUS_G3H was .230v and .032 in diode mode. I checked for the same value on all big coils and found that L8050 was also .032 in diode. I replaced U8050 and PPBUS was no longer shorted anymore but it still will not turn on. Now I have 20v 0.04a and seem to have all S5 voltages but nothing on any S4. I can't seem to find anymore shorts so not sure where to look next. Here are some voltages I took.\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 13v\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.3v\nPPVCCPRIMCORE_SUS_PCH - 1v\nS5_PWRGD - 3.3v\nPP1V8_S4 - 0v\nPP5V_S4 - 0v\nPP3V3_S4 - 0v"
