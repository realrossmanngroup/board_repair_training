Thanks for all of the advice before this thread, because it got me here today.\n\nCustomer brought in an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1990</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01814A</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>.  It's stuck at 5V pulling .225A.  All 4 USB-C ports have been tested; only 3 were functional.\n\nI'm using the schematic for a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01041</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>.  No spill damage*; this is a super clean board.\n\nOff the bat, UB300 was visibly fried, and components CB3902, RB258, CB313, CB314, CB301, & <RESISTOR>R4808</RESISTOR> all appeared bad or burned with a small amount of what looked like corrosion.*  All of those components were removed.  RB258 & <RESISTOR>R4808</RESISTOR> were replaced with new resistors.\n\nMany 3V3 rails are present, but no 5V rails.  I thought this was beginning to sound like a T2 firmware issue, so I started down that road as well.
