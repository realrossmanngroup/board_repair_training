SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",

Initialy the machine stopped powering on after the owner took it apart to fix the hinges. Then he took it to a technician who managed to make it power on but only with the charger pluged in. After that I got it. The battery is marked with an X and if I take off the charger the machine goes to sleep.\nPP3v42 is present\nSMBUS lines look ok\nI get 11.5 V on <SIGNAL>CHGR_BGATE</SIGNAL> witch is pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> and I guess that does not alow it to open.\nISL and <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> chip have been changed, but I still get 11.5v on <SIGNAL>CHGR_BGATE</SIGNAL>.\nI am not verry experienced with this but I am trying pretty hard so some help would much apreciated.\nThan you."
