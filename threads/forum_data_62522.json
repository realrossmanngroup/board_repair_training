        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "D6905": "What is D6905? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input on very old Macbooks(before 2011), can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H? This is the input from the USB-C charger or the battery that is the input voltage for the chip responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H. It can be missing when capacitors on this line are shorted to ground, or when the diode in front of it leading to the chip that creates PP3V3_G3H is blown. .",
        "PPBUS_G3H_R": "What is PPBUS_G3H_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR_R": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "R6999": "What is R6999? a RESISTOR.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",

        "SMC_RST": "What is SMC_RST? a SIGNAL.",
        "C7050": "What is C7050? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for battery current sensing, you should measure around 2.202 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
