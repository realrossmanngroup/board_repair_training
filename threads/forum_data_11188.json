I keep seeing stains on my boards after running them through my ultrasonic cleaner and letting them dry - looks like this: [url]http:\/\/imgur.com\/kPMe9Tg[\/url].\n\nI use a CP500HT with Branson EC per Louis' recommendations.  Is this a matter of not using enough Isopropyl to clean it off after the ultrasonic bath?  Or perhaps not letting it dry correctly?"}
