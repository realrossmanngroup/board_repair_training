I got into this so that I can always have a working iPod classic, and not many places will solder on those 30 pin connectors when you break them. I attended PBRS at iPad Rehab, downloaded and viewed Mike H.'s (from microsoldering.com) microsoldering course, and have been pretty much soldering something every day since getting into this. \n\nThough I've gotten pretty good at reading phone schematics, the MacBook schematics are new to me. I did go through the Rossman Repair Training Guide, and it's certainly helpful, but I'll need to a bit to get up to speed. \n\nAs stated above, I recently received a MacBook Pro that was filled with lotion on the MagSafe 2 adapter side. I've pulled it apart, cleaned out the lotion, washed the board and MagSafe connector in the ultrasonic bath, and reassembled. During this process, I realized that the microphone connector had shorted so badly that the ribbon cable had actually fused with the connector. In order to eliminate this as a source of potential short, I removed that connector from the board. \n\nThis is where the computer is at: plugging it in results in expected behavior from the MagSafe adapter: the light turns on and responds. The fan kicks on immediately and runs at what appears to be full speed. Disconnecting the DC power and hooking up the battery will result in more-or-less the same behavior. No boot, obviously, and no chime. \n\nLooking at the board while its running with the thermal camera shows no obvious hot spots. I can see a warm spot in the flash drive, the fan connector, and many of the ground connections on different components are warm. Based on this, I'm hypothesizing that something, somewhere is shorted to ground. I'm just not sure where to start. \n\nBased on the Rossman Repair Training Guide, I feel confident in stating that PPBUS_G3H is functioning properly, and I believe my next step is to assess the state of the SMC, and\/or check all of the G3 always hot lines, though I am totally not confident in this plan. \n\nAny thoughts or insights that can be provided would be helpful and much appreciated, especially from those of you who've cleaned lotion out of MacBooks in the past. \n\nThanks."}
