(but we are not getting 20v at this point)\n\nThere was water damage on this board.  Most all the damage was localized round <CHIP>U2890</CHIP>  I had to replace all the pull up 3.3K resistors that were tied to 3V3 TBT X Flash as well as the cap.   I also pulled and inspected <CHIP>U2890</CHIP> for pad damage and reflowed.  \n\nI am not getting 20v on the charger.   I see some chitchat activity and can watch each <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> light up on thermal when I move from jack to jack.  Current draw is almost 0.  I have diode checked all around the TI <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> chips and compared against my reference board.  Everything passes in diode test.  I do not think there is a issue with either of the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s and water was not present in this area.\n\nI have read the data sheet on <CHIP>U2890</CHIP> and don't see how a serial data storage device could be the cause of this.\nI need to learn more about the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s \n\nIf anyone has any input I would greatly appreciate it."
