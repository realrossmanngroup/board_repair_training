            "message": "got this laptop in from a customer. Small signs of liquid damage near usb ports, especially on <CAPACITOR>C2975</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C2978</CAPACITOR>. I don't usually work on the newer models so just wanted some advice before I dive in.\nI get 20V on both usb ports but 0.01-0.03A so not turning on\nI cleaned the corrosion with alcohol and toothbrush, but I'm measuring a short across <CAPACITOR>C2975</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C2978</CAPACITOR>, so basically between <SIGNAL>PP3V3_TBT_X_S0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP0V9_X_SVR_AGND</SIGNAL>. I think I can see a heartbeat if I use alcohol on <CAPACITOR>C2975</CAPACITOR>, but I'm afraid to remove it because of <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> on the other side of the board. Is it safe to use hot air to remove it or should I wedge it off with my soldering iron.\nAlso, I'm worried the short might actually be on <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>, any advice for removing the shield so I can check?\n\nThanks a lot"
