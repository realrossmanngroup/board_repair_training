The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence.."

But there are other issues too when it does boot it will load into the critical update, Can only get into operating system in safe mode, had mild liquid damage around <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> from what i am reading the critical update is usually from <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> failing. but the not turning on from the power button or opening the lid is confusing. Power button does work with SMC reset. But thats it even when the macbook is on the power button wont switch it off. If you close the lid in safe mode and open it again the screen wont wake im not sure if this is normal in safe mode or not.\nI just cleaned up the mild liquid damage. no idea where to start."
