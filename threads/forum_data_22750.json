        "message":"Hey guys I know it is the wrong section but I don't know where else to post\n\nso I need to get datas out of a zenfone and maybe fix it if it is possible. \n\nthe phone was dropped into a public bathroom, it was previously \"fixed\" by another shop. The shield was removed in a shitty manner and the board seems to have met a jevelery grade ultrasonic. Customer said the phone worked for a couple of months but now it is completely dead and the other store said that they can't fix it anymore\n\nI found this knocked out cap near the eMMC \n[IMG]http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/O2AqrbT.jpg[\/img]\n\nand this burned thing. I don't know what it is or what it does\n\n[img]http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/g4ASYEw.jpg[\/img]\n\nafter fixing that capacitor and a new bath into the ultrasonic and a whole day of charging the phone woke up to this\n\n[img]http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ujhWwCo.jpg[\/img]\n\nnow what? Try to load a new firmware?"

I am pretty sure it was the cap Tho as it was very very close to the eMMC. I got no schematics or stuff so it will be an unsolved mistery. Datas are saved so that is what matters"

I wanted to buy it from his affiliated link but Amazon didn't want to ship to bloody Italy so I found it on the bay in the U.S. it is incredible how quick shipments from the us to Europe are. Waaaay faster than from China or even some eu countries. My Amscope took 6 days to arrive. \n\n[url]http:\/\/www.ebay.com\/itm\/322426613767[\/url]\n\nand as I said it is also on Louis links. I love this thing. My old Chinese shit lasted 4 smc reflows then burned. This thing here has took any kind of chemicals and it is still mint."
