It\u2019s been liquid damaged for long time before he brought in. I cleaned and did visual inspection and found backlight section damaged. I replaced the backlight Ic, LVDS connector and jumper from pin 8 to Iset resistor. It came to life back. But keep shutting down in 5-6 mins after start up. I have tried by replacing other parts like I\/O board, fan and I\/O board cable. I didn\u2019t find any other rusted component. What could be the reason for this random shut down. Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance."}
