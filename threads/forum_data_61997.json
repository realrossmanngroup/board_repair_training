        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

Located the short down to a shorted out cap and replaced, also replaced F7140 after confirming there was no further short.\nBoard powers up enters S0 state has fan spin but CPU VCORE is missing also <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWR_GOOD</SIGNAL> is missing. Checked <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> and i'm only getting 0.65V there instead of 3.3v. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> are all 3.3v as expected. No short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> - it's reading 2.5kohm to ground.\n\nI've replaced <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> just to rule that out but no difference\n\n\nNo liquid board is very clean i'm a bit stumped as to where to go with this one - clearly the low voltage on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> will prevent VCore from being turned on but I cannot see anything visible on the board which would cause this issue. - the resistance on L7410/L7420 to ground is 30ohms so looks like the CPU is ok."

            "message": "Thanks once again - nailed the issue in one. Checked <CHIP>U8030</CHIP> had 3.3V on the input side ok, looked then carefully at <CHIP>U8030</CHIP> under the scope and saw a tiny crack on one edge of it. Pulled a replacement from a scrap <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and system works perfectly now, starts up, chimes boots only other issue is the battery wouldn't charge or run off the battery even though it was showing 70% charge. Tried a known good battery which works fine so I don't know what is going on there. Best guess i've got is the macbook was dropped - the original cap with the short was cracked as was <CHIP>U8030</CHIP> so maybe something broken inside the battery. \n\nOne interesting observation i've made on this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> - <CHIP>U8030</CHIP> was not covered with hot glue like it is on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> - therefore easily liable to damage! I'm not sure if that is supposed to be that way and i'll make a note to check the next time an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> comes in if this IC is covered or not."
