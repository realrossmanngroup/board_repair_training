            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> stuck in 1 second fan spin loop.  Multiple places with corrosion, cleaned well with ultrasonic. \n\nReplaced <CHIP>U5400</CHIP> and ran wires reconnecting it to <RESISTOR>R5400</RESISTOR>.\nAnother bad trace between <TRANSISTOR>Q5490</TRANSISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5494</RESISTOR> fixed\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> is toggling on and off and I traced it to multiple places on the board looking for it's souce.  It's produced by <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> per the schematic but then I see that is has something to do with GPIO29 which is related to <SIGNAL>SLP_LAN</SIGNAL>.  Is the LAN somehow putting this machine into sleep mode.\n\nmuch appreciated,\nPaul"
