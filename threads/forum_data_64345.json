(It takes 16V from bench PSU, and the amperage is very strange (oscilating bettewn 1~2A w/o battery). No fan spin, and CPU gets very hot, and thats with I try to don't take too long with it connected to the PSU.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> = 0.002 diode reading.\n\nIt had corrosion on <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>, and so I've replaced it.\n\nNow, on L7560 I have only 0.002 on diode reading, and comparing it with other board, it should be arround 0.400.\n\nI've lifted L7560 and the low reading is on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_REG_R</SIGNAL> side.\n\nI've injected 1.5V there, but nothing gets hot.\n\nON <RESISTOR>R7560</RESISTOR> pin1 (<SIGNAL>P3V3_S5_VFB2_R</SIGNAL>) I have 0.014 on diode reading, but I think I should have around 0.400. Already replaced <RESISTOR>R7560</RESISTOR>/63, but same readings.\n\nCan you help?"
