(It takes 16V from bench PSU, and the amperage is very strange (oscilating bettewn 1~2A w\/o battery). No fan spin, and CPU gets very hot, and thats with I try to don't take too long with it connected to the PSU.\n\nPP3V3_S5 = 0.002 diode reading.\n\nIt had corrosion on U7501, and so I've replaced it.\n\nNow, on L7560 I have only 0.002 on diode reading, and comparing it with other board, it should be arround 0.400.\n\nI've lifted L7560 and the low reading is on PP3V3_S5_REG_R side.\n\nI've injected 1.5V there, but nothing gets hot.\n\nON R7560 pin1 (P3V3_S5_VFB2_R) I have 0.014 on diode reading, but I think I should have around 0.400. Already replaced R7560\/63, but same readings.\n\nCan you help?"}
