        "message":"Hi there, had some shorts on the LDO's U3100 and U3200 Replaced both CD3215s and shorts gone and now all 4 ports are 5V and resetting. Missing LDO 1V1 on U3100, Checked resistors around it and diode check and everything looks good. Tried rom from different board and same behavior all ports act good but missing that 1v1 on U3100 WITH charger connected to appropriate port (I did try the other port just to be sure). Tried a second CD3215 at U3100. Not seeing issue with traces. Oy! Is there anything outside of the ROM and local connections that could cause??"
