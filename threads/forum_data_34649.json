        "message":"No water damage, no obvious drops, tried two batteries, one of which is known-good. Any ideas where to start? ASD EFI shows no errors except the usual when the battery is low(sensor vb0r) which I know is normal.\nCan't see any fried chips or anything.\n\nR7120(pp dcin in rush etc,) voltage steadily drops from around 16.7v downwards, thought it may have been a bad charge port board but i disconnected it and it still drops. The device charges normally, however. Or is it just the caps draining? Resistance to ground is around 300k then drops to 220k then goes back up slowly\n\ntwo solderballs sticking out from C1031(ppVCC_CPU_s0) - Resistance to ground 66.5ohm on pin 1.\nAlso, same with c1060(ppmain_io_cpu) - resistance to ground [B].[\/B]880k\nboth of these are in close proximity to cpu of course.\n\nmaybe some humidity or heat damage since some test points are slightly rainbow throughout the board. But no water drops or corrosion marks anywhere in housing or on board.\n\nI will get more powerline measurements when I get back to my workshop:\n\nvoltages with fully charged battery only plugged in(no charger connected):\nbattery connector:\npin 1-3 ppvbat - 8.47v Diode mode - OL to ground***\npin 4 smbus smc 5 g3 scl - 3.416v diode mode - .5v to ground\npin 5 smc sda - 3.416v Diode mode - .5v to ground\npin 6 - sys detect l - OL Diode mode - OL to ground - Resistance is 9.94k(r6950 ok)\npin 7-9 ground diode mode 0v obv\n\nstill only battery connected:\nppbus_g3h = 8.43v\npp5v_s5 = 0v\npp3v3_s5 = 0v\n\nWith charger and battery(machine on):\nppbus_g3h=8.55v\npp5v_s5 = 5.13v\npp3v3_s5 = 3v338v\n\nafter machine turns on with charger, it can stay powered on until shutdown or power loss"
