Liquid damage was focussed around the U7650 area. I've cleaned it all and visibly inspected the area - resoldered U7650 as pins 31 and 26 were not shiny anymore. \nIf I connect charger it negotiates to 20v as expected but with a tiny spike to 0.07a current draw then drops to 0.00a. PPBUS is present at 13V but there is no PP5V_S5. PP5V_S5 is not shorted to ground either. I'm wondering if this is a dead U7650 or if water damage at U7650 might've killed U7800.\n\nU7800 area is clean"}
