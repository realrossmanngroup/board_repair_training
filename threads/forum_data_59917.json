I've cleaned it all and visibly inspected the area - resoldered <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> as pins 31 and 26 were not shiny anymore. \nIf I connect charger it negotiates to 20v as expected but with a tiny spike to 0.07a current draw then drops to 0.00a. PPBUS is present at 13V but there is no <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> is not shorted to ground either.
