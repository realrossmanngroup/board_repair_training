            "message": "Hi all,\n\ngot a strange 12inch MacBook here.\n\nOriginal issue was that it booted but to a flashing question mark. Narrowed this down to the Audio cable.\n\nnow it boots to the volume but slowly and then shows the prohibitory sign.\n\nThe IPD cable is also shorting <SIGNAL>US_G3H_TPAD_F</SIGNAL> to ground on F4800 and causes it not to boot at all.\n\nso I have a new IPD cable on its way but my question is:\n\nshould the machine still boot to an OS even without the IPD trackpad and keyboard connected?\n\ni know some of the MacBooks boot slow or donâ€™t boot without a battery etc. Wondered if this is the similar?\n\nthanks\nJamie"
