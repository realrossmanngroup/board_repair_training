        "message":"I have a 3476 that had minor liquid damage. Ultrasonic cleaned and repaired pp3v2\nIt all runs perfectly but freezes almost as soon as it gets to OS X.\n\nOne of my members of staff noticed it doesn't free when an external display is plugged in. From here ive figured out that if you get it running a youtube video and then unplug the display it doesn't freeze either.\nSeems to be freezing in relation to having low load on the Integrated graphics, Maybe something to do with hardware acceleration or power saving state? \n\nIm unsure what to look for next, but the fault is interesting and therefore id really like to fix it!"
