Damaged a few things which I've sorted, but I seem to have hit a wall with the audio:\n\nPads 12 (<SIGNAL>GPIO_1</SIGNAL>), 14 (<SIGNAL>GPIO_2</SIGNAL>), and 47 (SPDIF in) were ripped off of <CHIP>U6201</CHIP>'s site. They don't appear anywhere else in the schematics or in the board view. I inspected the pad-sites very well and neither of these 3 pads appear to have traces underneath that I can attempt to anchor to. Right now, the audio on the board works at about 5% of normal volume (missed that it was present at all until I listed extremely closely), and only from the right speaker.\n\nIs this board fucked in terms of internal audio? Nowhere to run wires apparently, and no traces visible underneath the pads. Any advice appreciated."

I would recommend first checking the resistance in the output stage of the amplifier, since maybe the audio is just disappearing to ground.\nIs the analogue voltage to the DAC/Amp ok? (<SIGNAL>PP4V5_AUDIO_ANALOG</SIGNAL>). Does it work with headphones?\n\nCould be a lot of things, never seen this specific issue before."

            "message": "Thanks, smiba. I thought that might be the case, due to the missing traces. I couldn't figure out the purpose of having pins with actual names that imply input/output, but have them go nowhere. I'm sure there's a reason beyond my current knowledge.\n\nI stopped troubleshooting to ask this question, as I didn't want to spend time troubleshooting if the issue was obviously at <CHIP>U6201</CHIP>. I'll get going on it as planned now and will post back if I can't restore audio--thanks again, Smiba! I have a feeling some of the amps might be damaged, as whoever \"replaced\" <CHIP>U6201</CHIP> did an absolute shit job, and this board had a short on 1v5 that I had to resolve previously. Wouldn't surprise me if they did this with the battery connected."
