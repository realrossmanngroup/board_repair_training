The lower resistance measurements are simply because the electricity found a different way to flow\n\n\nThe resistance to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is bad though, that shoudn't be so low.\n\nInject 1V into it and start with something like 2 Amps and increase after a while if nothing noticeable heats up. Only increase voltage if you're running into an amperage limit\nIts probably a capacitor or IC shorted somewhere, see what heats up. Use alcohol when you have found a spot that is somewhat hot, unless you want to make the same mistake as me by burning the tip of your finger on a shitty 0402 capacitor thats burning hot ;)"
