I have no way to test the display independently however I have no reason to suspect it being bad.\nI would love some guidance...\n\nThe only spare parts I have on hand are from several other branded laptops, otherwise I'll be looking to your suggestions for replacement parts, lacking that, it would be ebay.\n\n\np.s. I enjoy the live streams but I'm not getting notified until long after they are over.\n\n[URL=\"http:\/\/imgur.com\/K3y4PtI\"]http:\/\/imgur.com\/K3y4PtI\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/HeHSuRW[\/URL]"}

It's owned by a cute waitress at the corner bar, she brought it to a \"few\" places, all said they couldn't fix it (no specifics given). Again, no signs of water damage or corrosion or any signs of anything but normal wear and tear. There were a couple screws missing but just from the bottom plate. I have a raspberry pi 3, arduino, ftdi, and USBASP + ISP 51 for Atmel AVR USB Programmer ..if one of these will do, ill happily try to reflash the bios. I thought I saw something about using a raspberry pi to flash the chip but have no experience with mac's.\n\nAlso, I edited my first post to include links to full sized images on imgur. I can't seem to delete the one remaining tiny image posted originally.\n\nLooking at  [TABLE=\"border: 0\"]\n[TR=\"bgcolor: #dddddd\"]\n[TD]SST[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]SST25VF032B[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: right\"]4096[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]SPI[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]OK[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]OK[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]OK[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]OK[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]2.700[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]3.600[\/TD]\n \t\t[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]\n\nit appears my raspberry pi will\/should work based on\n[url]https:\/\/www.rossmanngroup.com\/boards\/forum\/board-repair-troubleshooting\/2455-how-to-read-write-erase-apple-efi-spi-rom-with-raspberry-pi[\/url]\n&\n[url]https:\/\/www.flashrom.org\/Supported_hardware#Supported_flash_chips[\/url]\n\nI assume my 220 ohm resistors will suffice as a suitable substitute for 150 ohm in this use case.\n[url]http:\/\/imgur.com\/EAXwlfw[\/url]\n\nIf you think this is the path to take, I'll give it a shot."}

I'd just reflow it and see if it works. Do keep in mind that even if the chip is bad the replacements you will get are actually shittier than your reflowed zombie chip. I've reflowed a bunch that worked, and only a few worked when I replaced the reflowed chip with the \"new\" chip. I put the original \"reflowed\" one back on and it worked.\n\nI am not saying this is something I would charge a customer for, but if you are at your wits end and just want curiosity answered, I'd reflow MCP79."}
