        "message":"Gday guys, i have an 820-3332 that had an imploded battery and when plugged in would make fan spin constantly with no boot. after removing the board i plugged it back in with no battery and it does nothing. there is no ampre draw. im getting green orange light. charging circuit seems normal. isl6259 r7021\/22 are both 15ohms. this seems to be normal when i test other machines but the schematic says its a 10ohm not sure why this is. do i need to power this machine on? i thought it starts automaticallay."
