PBUS is pulsing regularly at about 1hz. Sounds like a short somewhere? PP1V8_SLPS2R is trying to turn on but failing (only going up to about 0.1V it looks like). The rail is about 2ohms to ground. Is this too low? Injected a bit of current but T2 is the only thing that got warm.\n\nPP3V3_G3H_T is 3.3V and so is PP3V3_G3H_RTC.\n\nHistory: 2 probe points at T2 ROM were ripped off the board (SOCROM_CLK and SOCROM_MOSI). Soldered 2 wires for them directly to the resistors at T2."}

But it jumps around a bit. That's unfortunate because only T2 got warm when I injected current. Maybe some crud under it? I hate this T2 bs."}
