            "message": "Hello!\n\nA new contender. 5v and ~30mA on the charger. PBUS is pulsing regularly at about 1hz. Sounds like a short somewhere? <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> is trying to turn on but failing (only going up to about 0.1V it looks like). The rail is about 2ohms to ground. Is this too low? Injected a bit of current but T2 is the only thing that got warm.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_T</SIGNAL> is 3.3V and so is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL>.\n\nHistory: 2 probe points at T2 ROM were ripped off the board (<SIGNAL>SOCROM_CLK</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SOCROM_MOSI</SIGNAL>). Soldered 2 wires for them directly to the resistors at T2."
