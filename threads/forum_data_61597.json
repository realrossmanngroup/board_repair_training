            "message": "This board had a spill around the power button. I cleaned it up and all the pins on the power button connector are functional and reading correct diode numbers compared to a good board. Touch ID works fine. The power button is pulling <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> low and I'm measuring that all the way over to <RESISTOR>R5170</RESISTOR>, but the computer is not responding. I've checked all the resistors on the line. Everything looks good. The spill was very minimal. <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> is measuring 3.4V. Nothing wrong with anything in the circuit that I can find. Is this just the SMC not responding? Not sure what else it could be."
