I only get 5V, and PPBUS is 12.3 with charger connected. I have compared diode mode on the LDO of the CD3217 and all seems good , all basic rails for the CD3217 are present: there\u2019s no corrosion anywhere. I couldn\u2019t find a short either: board is spotless. Please help . Thank you"}

This one has been resolved. \n\nSo it turns out D3349 and D3328 were burnt out, which then caused damage to both CD3217, replaced both CD3217 and D3349+D3328, and the 20V was restored.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your help."}
