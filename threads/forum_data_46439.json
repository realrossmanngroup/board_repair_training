            "message": "This one had a drop of liquid near bios and smc. It was booting with some voltages pulsing...\n\nDiscovered the Miso pin 2 of bios was not connected because of a burned probe/link point.\nAs soon as I restored the trace, the logicboard started but while booting to the OS it simply shut off.\n\nI tried an SMC bypass just to see if it's a sensor issue but it wasn't, board was still shuting off in the middle of the progress bar. So I decided to reflow the smc because I saw some greenish crap but it doesn't help at all.\n\nI started to think that at this point it could be anything, then I remember that it was unresponsive to PRAM so I thought maybe the bios got corrupted (that could make sense, no pram + burned Miso probe point) :\n\nAnd boom this time board doesn't shut down and fully boot to OS with another bios.\n\nSo my question at this point is how to tackle this: I take the ME block from my original non working bios and copy it into the working replacement bios and changing the fsys block.\n\nOr I just take a clean ME and copy over the original FSYS block?\nThanks"
