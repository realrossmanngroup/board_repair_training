Got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that came in with strange fault and almost no sign of liquid damage.\nFan would only spin up once and it wouldn't post.\nI ran it through the ultrasonic cleaner- It came out working, but has a strange wifi issue.\nSometimes it will have wifi at boot menue but not in OSX\nSometimes it will have wifi in OSX but not boot menue\nSometimes it will have no wifi at all.\n\nive checked all wifi stuff, tried other cards, Its symptoms randomly change when a PRAM reset is performed. \n\nIm started to wonder if the CPU is on its way out and the heat of baking after an ultrasonic clean has temporarily bought it back to life.\nThanks"
