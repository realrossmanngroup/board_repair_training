            "message": "I have this 13\" M1 which had liquid damage. The trackpad connector was burned. After replacement of trackpad connector and flex machine boots and trackpad is working.\n\nBut when I connect the power supply to the USB-C port to charge the battery the screen turns pink for a while and the machine reboots.\n\nI have tried minimal configuration with only a known good battery, a known good display and a known good USB-C board. The error remains with only these three peripherals connected to the board.\n\nMachine charges fine (as long it is started up with the charger already connected). I can connect external hard drive and external display which both works fine. It only crashes when I connect charger.\n\nI have also tried to restore a fresh installation of Monterey in DFU mode to rule out a software issue.\n\nLink to video of what is going on: [MEDIA=vimeo]703328874[/MEDIA]\n\nWhat to do next?"
