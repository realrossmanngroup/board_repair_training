(no liquid damage but just didn't turn on one morning)\n\nFound a shorting cap <CAPACITOR>C7431</CAPACITOR> (<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL>)\nThought it was going to be very easy as it was replaced and diode tested okay. Turns on now and boots, sees the battery serial etc but doesn't charge it. Also sees the battery at 86% on the original and 20% on the known good.\n\nIf you pull the magsafe, it cuts power with a battery connected.\nTried another battery, tried another DCIN.\n\nOn magsafe only, I get an initial green light that changes to orange, I get 16.5v on Pin 2 & 3 of <DIODE>D7005</DIODE>. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 8.52v\n\nOn battery only, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 1.4v\n\nRemoved F7140 to diode test pin 1 and 2.\nPin 1 = 0.125v\nPin2 = 0.450v\n\nDo I have a short somewhere on PPVBATT side of F7140 or have I gone the wrong direction for fault finding?"
