        "A1278": "What is A1278? A1278 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook or Macbook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2254, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2327, 820-2530, 820-2879, 820-2936, 820-3115..",

        "R6990": "What is R6990? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on Macbooks from around the year 2012. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. ."
