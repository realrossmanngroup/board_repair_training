        "message":"hi guys,\nhaving a 820-3115 a1278 board, short on PPDCIN_G3H.\nremoved F6905. short is on the pin2 still.\n\nI checked and PPDCIN_G3H go to few places, then I removed almost all the components connected to it,including R6990,Q7085,Q5490.\nbut still short to ground. it's \"0\" in diode mode.\n\nLook around and see like broken trace on one of the usb port, seems like it's dropped with something plugged in,and  the very top layer of PCB has a crack.\nL4705 removed, and pin2 is still shorted to ground. removed U4600, still shorted to ground\n\n\nso found two shorts now, PPDCIN_G3H and pp5v_s3_usb_b_ilim\n\nI tried injecting power to PPDCIN_G3H, only 1. sth Voltage already got the Amp to almost 5A.\n\nand nothing is really hot on board but the clam from the DC machine.\n\n\ndoubting on the PCB layers maybe short and damaged? anyway to fix case like this?\n\nthanks"
