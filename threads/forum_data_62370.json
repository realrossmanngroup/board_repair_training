Client said that it suddenly died - Took 5v and 0.250 amp in. One of the thunderbolt ports bootlooped every 2-3 seconds.\nI thought it was <CHIP>U3060</CHIP> and other Thundebolt ROM because I have experienced that the issue could be found here (several times)  They were all good - so no issue here.\n\nI thought there might be some signs when looking at it in my thermal camera but it did not help very much. I looked at the hot spots shown on the camera and after I measured around the <SIGNAL>U2800_T</SIGNAL> (under shield) I did found a short. The short was under the <SIGNAL>U2800_T</SIGNAL>.\nRepair of the area and donor <SIGNAL>U2800_T</SIGNAL> it came back to life! \n\nHow could there be a short under <SIGNAL>U2800_T</SIGNAL> with a clean board? I really do not not know! The client used a modified charger but could that be the main reason. I don't think so?\n\nI hope it is okay to post this kind here.\n\nGreetings Morten"
