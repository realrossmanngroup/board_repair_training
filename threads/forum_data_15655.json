        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U9701": "What is U9701? a CHIP.",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT is the voltage rail for the backlight of the LCD screen. .",
        "LCD_BKLT_PWM": "What is LCD_BKLT_PWM? LCD_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "SMC_LID_R": "What is SMC_LID_R? SMC_LID_R is the signal coming from the hall sensor that detects whether the laptop screen is closed or open. This must be high in order for SMC_LID to be high. SMC_LID has to be high for the machine to not fall asleep and for it to have a backlight.."
