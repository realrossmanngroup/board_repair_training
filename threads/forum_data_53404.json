I have fixed 11 of them so far but a few of them have MDM on them.  I have found this out when trying to load the OS on my test drive.  You only find out near the end of the process which takes forever!\n\nThis is my first encounter with MDM.  \nI want to be able to sell these boards to users who need board replacements.  \n\nIf I flash the bios with the customer's Serial number and do a NVRAM reset will MDM still be present?"
