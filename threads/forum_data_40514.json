This customer brought it in for me, I inspected it, no liquid damage anywhere... very clean. I plugged in a cord and it fired up... I loaded it up with stress, and nothing bad happened... so I sent it back to him... he brought it back and said it had the same problems... won't turn on etc... apple said they'd fix it for $800 but he didn't say what they were going to do. Any ideas? I dont have donor boards or anything to compare with for this beast."
