A1502 2015 Model 820-4924A board. It powers up normally but it won't boot properly. With the customers OS X install which is filevault protected after entering the password we get the apple logo then the loading bar appears and it goes all the way to the end and then just sits there - boot process never finishes. So diagnostic cap on - I plug in my external hdd with OS X Catalina on it and try to boot from that, same behaviour goes slowly through to the end of the bar and then sits there. Grabbed another external hdd with OS X El Capitan on it - same behaviour. \n\nOn the hardware side - i've tried unplugging the webcam, SSD, touchpad, left i\/o board but no change in the boot up behaviour. Have even swapped the battery with another new one as I seem to recall seeing one of Louis's videos where a battery caused a boot up issue. \n\nIs this a fault anyone has seen before as it's got me stumped!"}
