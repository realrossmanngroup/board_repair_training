            "message": "This board had corrosion mainly around <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>. If I plug into the top USB-C port the board will get 20V and turn on normally. If I plug into the bottom port the voltage on <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> fluctuates from 0V up 5V and right back down. So F3001 goes up and down. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> also goes up and down from 0V to 3.4V. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO</SIGNAL> also goes up and down. I've replaced everything that looked bad. I can't find any shorts. I'm guessing I might be to the point of having to replace <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>. But also wondering if I should, or can, just leave it alone and not use the bottom USB-C port."

            "message": "Ok, so I pulled the new <CAPACITOR>C3208</CAPACITOR> capacitor I put on because this wasn't happening with the old burnt out one and I wanted to see if that might help. I was measuring around 3KOhms to ground. Without <CAPACITOR>C3208</CAPACITOR> on at all the board turned on. And yes, all the voltages were coming up and down including the LDO voltage. I replaced <CAPACITOR>C3208</CAPACITOR> again and the board is working. My replacement <CAPACITOR>C3208</CAPACITOR> must have been damaged in the soldering process. It's a little messy because I was avoiding using hot air to attach the new one so it might have gotten burnt out internally. Thanks for the tips."
