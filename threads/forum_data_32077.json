    "definitions": {
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PP3V4S_G3H": "What is PP3V4S_G3H? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",

        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. ."

Is <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> making its way to the DC in board? Can you measure <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> on pin 5 of <CHIP>U6901</CHIP> and <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> at 3v on pins 1/2? If not, how do the <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, and <SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> pins look on J9500? How do the pins on the DC in cable, the 821-1722 look?\n\nIf that's all good, then we keep looking. One thing troubling is <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> being low. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> comes from <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>. <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> tells <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> to turn on and create <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>.

I have an small issue I bought a SMC stencil and solder paste from you. I think I'm doing something wrong way as stencil stick to the SMC and it was a nightmare to reball the SMC. I watched your SMC reball video few times and want to know do we have to put flux on the smc before attcheed the Stencil? or am i outing too much solder paste? Tried few times but everytime I screwed up and finally did with normal solder this soldering iron which is not the correct way. Anyway thank you very much for all your support louis."
