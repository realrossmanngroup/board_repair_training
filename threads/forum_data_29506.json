It was slightly water damaged and had no green light and was missing some rails.\n\nI changed the SMC and have green light and all my power rails. CPU gets warm. Fan spins for 8 seconds, off for 4 seconds, and on for 4 seconds, and will turn back on and stay on.\n\nU7200 was hit the worst. Had to make jumpers and changed the chip. C6950 & C6951 hit with blown vias. U5810 pin 10 corroded and switched with one from 820-00165 board. U5660 pins 4 & 5 have a little corrosion but left alone; seems ok.\n\nI have tried a couple SMCs and get the same results."}
