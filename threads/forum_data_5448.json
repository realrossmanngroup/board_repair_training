Please answer Louis's questions too.\nPost measurements without cable inserted too.\nAre C3430\/31 L3401 looking ok?\nDid you actually check if all pins have continuity to the connector on the airport card? 1 2 4 5 7 8 11 12 13? The common failure here is a fucked up connector on the board or a missing cap or coil."
