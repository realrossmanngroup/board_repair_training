            "message": "Sort of stumped by an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> right now. Board came in with a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, which I located to <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>. Replaced those components, and short is gone, and board will power on from battery, but I have no green light and I'm missing basically everything (3v42, ppbus, etc). My <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> is essentially 0v, but no short is present. I'm getting the feeling that I have a critical resistor that's blown or something, but I can't find it. I checked all resistors around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, and they all measure out fine. Also checked <RESISTOR>R7001</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R6990</RESISTOR>, etc. I tried to start \"from the top\", but with 0v on <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> and no short, I don't really know where else to go.\n\nAny ideas where to go from here? All help appreciated."

Not sure which it was, the cap or one of the FETs, but I have green light and fan spin with charger now! Thank goodness; I'm going to get this guy into a test case and hopefully it will not have any other issues. I'll post back for sure once it passes everything, but did want to post this update now. Thank you Louis! I believe it may have been <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> after all."
