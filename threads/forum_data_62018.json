Do you need further info ‚Äì let me know.\nMacbook pro <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01987</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> without drops or fluid damage - smooth and clean. The history of the device; sent in because it couldn‚Äôt charge anymore. Charges if you take the charger out and in many times. Takes 19.2 volts and boots normally to .0600-0.700 amp (without battery), shows logo but crashes. circles (.100-.500amp )around until... Ends after 40 sek. It stops at 0.053 amp. Can‚Äôt find a short ‚Äì maybe a IC short? I want to hear if anyone knows of the boot row? it looks like the device is hitting something wrong through the boot process. Can anyone help me? I have a video of the bootprocess ‚Äì I will try to post it here (not possible:-)."
