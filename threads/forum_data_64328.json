            "message": "This board from an Air <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2179</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> arrived with liquid damage and <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> shorted to ground. After replacing several corroded capacitors, the short was removed, and the machine started up with the LCD backlight fully functional. Initially, the keyboard backlight appeared functional as well, but after a few days, it started turning off on its own, never staying on for more than a couple of seconds. There was corrosion in the area around <CHIP>U6500</CHIP>, so I replaced it and several resistors, capacitors, and inductors.\nNow the OS fails to recognize the keyboard backlight at all: in System Settings, the Keyboard preferences do not show the option \"Adjust keyboard brightness in low light\" and no backlight comes on.\nI've tried NVRAM reset, SMC reset, and a different topcase, but no change. How does the system detect the presence/absence of the keyboard backlight?"

            "message": "Hi, I'm sure you've already considered this, but is the screen original or a tester? Every time I've had this keyboard backlight issue, it's the screen being from an incorrect revision of the 2179 (or 1932). KB backlight shows only prior to login (first boot at lock screen), but goes away after logging in, and all KB lighting settings disappear in preferences. If it's the original screen, inspect logic board for LCD assembly. Camera connection being corroded/damaged can cause this, since ambient sensor is part of that connection."
