The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

This exposes some of the traces in the board but I don't think there are any broken connections.\n\nPicture:[URL]https://i.imgur.com/GFpcouU.jpg[/URL] & [URL]https://i.imgur.com/LJFhL3S.jpg[/URL]\n\nThe few metal things that are stuck on the pin all seem to be connected to the pin itself, which if it was still on the board would probably just connect the pin to those pads/holes?\n\nI think it should be alright, but I just wanted to make sure this is not the reason why the board would be non-functional. I rather don't want to spent hours of time just to realise its fucked :p\n\nThanks!"

I've never soldered caps like this so I have no idea how to properly desolder them from a donor board and solder them on. Especially when the legs are still in. What approach to take?\n\n(Since these caps are missing, would this be a reason for it not to enter a S0 state?)\n\nThanks again and sorry for being the biggest noob :o, Glad you're here to help\n\nEDIT: Also the yellow stuff on the pads, is that just glue or are those actual lines? I've never had ripped off pads before on a board and I need to know if I can scrape them away without ruining the complete board."

It has suffered from water damage but sadly I think someone else tried to \"fix\" it by just putting it in a ultrasonic (Which might have been to aggressive and knocked these parts off?). The water indicators are bright red but I don't see any corrosion at all\n\nI'll continue diagnosing the board soon, when I'm finished I'd love to put at least a few of those capacitors back. I don't think its alright to call it a quality repair while various parts are missing from the board.\n\nHow do I go and restore the pads for <CAPACITOR>C7619</CAPACITOR> and replace the 6 other caps just like it? (Some of them only have legs, but a few at a different part of the board have cracks going through them and I don't trust them to last) I tried looking on Louis his channel but I'm unable to find a video where he replaces these capacitors."
