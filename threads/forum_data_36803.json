            "message": "Ok so I'm stumped, and I'm sure it may be something dumb I'm overlooking, but this board came in with liquid around the SMC, clock chip, and a backlight chip. Cleaned areas of corrosion no problem nothing concerned me that much. Currently getting no light on the charger and <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> is on fire. I removed it and the diode to 3v42 to check for a short on input. I got no short but said what the hell and replaced the 3 input caps and 3v42 regulator to be safe. <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> remains on fire. I next thought possibly <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> and the ISL could be causing it so removed both and still no change <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> on fire. What else can be causing this resistor to burn? No short on 3v42 or <SIGNAL>PPVIN_PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>. No short on PPBUS. I'm out of ideas all help is appreciated."
