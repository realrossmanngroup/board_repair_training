Photobooth should still be present...and iSight (the camera), should work with both photobooth and facetime. I'm not quite sure what you meant by \"facetime replaced isight\"...as isight is just a term for the camera. Also wouldn't necessarily show any results if you search for it in OSX...because it's just what the camera is called. Does that make sense? If you open photobooth and camera (isight) works, then great! If it doesn't, it might be an ME issue. But if you're able to update to HS, I would think this should be resolved.
