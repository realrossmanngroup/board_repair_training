        "BKLT_PWM": "What is BKLT_PWM? BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKLT_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

        "LP8545": "What is LP8545? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

It appears as if there was liquid damage but not in the area of the LCD connector or the <CHIP>LP8545</CHIP>.\nI tested with another display I have and that one also had no backlight and I could see the flashing folder as well.\n<SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> measured 3.11v but when I measured <RESISTOR>R9704</RESISTOR>(<SIGNAL>BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL>) I got 0.008v.\n\nOn Pin 40 of the LCD Connector I was getting around 24v on backlight.\n\nI even ran a wire from pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R9731</RESISTOR> to Pin1 of <RESISTOR>R9704</RESISTOR> and when I measured <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL> they both measured 0v which looks like something is pulling those down.\n\nShould I replace the <CHIP>LP8545</CHIP> or should I ultrasonic the board to make sure the <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> chip is not the issue?"
