            "message": "This board is coming almost all the way up and then restarting. Has CPU, fan spin and then cycles off and on. The RAM is getting hot and <SIGNAL>PPDDR_S3_REG_R</SIGNAL> is measuring low in diode mode at about .085 vs .120 on a good board. It measures 1.35V before the board cycles. <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> is getting hot also. It's not a quick cycle, the board stays up for a second or two - almost long enough to chime. PPBUS drops way down before it cycles off. No liquid-damage. Is this just blown RAM?"
