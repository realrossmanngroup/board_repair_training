When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution.

Board visually seems fine doesn’t look warped no visible cracks in anything board side.\n\nwent through the power sequence diagram on logiwiki for the 01055 because there doesn’t seem to be one for the 1987? All rails up until pp3v3s5 are present. Found out that pp3v3s5 and pp1v8s5 are coming on when you first connect the board but they shutdown after around 15 seconds or so.It seems like the PMIC is detecting a short on a minor sub rail and shutting down.\n\nso the question is are there any signature faults with the PMIC and the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01987</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>? Unfortunately I do not have a thermal camera so I’m hoping there’s a shortcut I can follow. Freaking seeks have gone from 500 to 900 hence why I’ve been putting it off, not to mention we don’t do much of this so it’s hard to justify spending a grand for a once in a blue moon job.\n\nthanks for the assistance!"

            "message": "Thanks, thought as much. I noticed the same when I was working on that 1958 a while ago. The large cap on the left side of the nand in the photo above is <CAPACITOR>C8751</CAPACITOR> what do you think those three TPs with the blue squares are? Being behind the CPU there probably supposed to be quite low resistance I'm guessing, but not 0.002 ohms so I'm guessing there what the issue is but unfortunately the only other way to test those lines is remove the T2/PMIC shield which I really want to leave as a last resort. \n\nSorry forgot to mention that in the original post. It is not recognized in DFU. That said the only mac we have is a <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> which only will upgrade to Monterey, I tried upgrading it further, but it says it's not supported via the app store so not sure if you can \"force\" upgrade these or not. I did use the master port on the 1987 and tried both ports on the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. I have not tried forcing DFU via the test pad because the rails were shutting down I assumed there's further board level faults not firmware faults.\n\nYes I checked diode mode on all the coils. The CPU ones seem a little low comparing them to open board data, but there within 15% which I'm hoping is just meter differences/board differences and not a dead CPU. Is this board one of the ones that is required to have a working CPU to get 20V?\n\nJust checked now yes S3 & S0 are also pulsing. Checked <SIGNAL>PP1V_S3</SIGNAL> & <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S0_L</SIGNAL>. I did not check them earlier as the S5s were pulsing. \nSomethings burned out as when I went to check <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> the USB C meter now is only outputting 5V 0.200A in all 4 orientations of the usb c cable.\n\n Damaged tracks definitely but I doubt it's a knocked off component. Physically board looks fine, normally if there's knocked off components you can see a part of the pad or the component torn or remaining, but everything looks normal. There are some components \"missing\" for example <RESISTOR>R5929</RESISTOR> that whole row is missing and not marked as no stuff in the schematic. As is the row of <RESISTOR>R5569</RESISTOR>. As are the caps in the vertical assortment in between those row's ex <CAPACITOR>C5569</CAPACITOR> and again not marked as no stuff in the schematic."

I do not want to do this though as I'm concerned the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> I have won't be able to detect it.

Do these require a battery to boot or complete DFU restore? I was originally doing it board only and kept getting -75. Read Logiwiki and it mentioned trackpad and battery must be connected but I didn't have the battery ribbon, so I just connected trackpad and that's where I got the above lock screen. I've got the flex now so is it worth putting the board back in the chassis and connecting battery and TP to retry DFU?"

Disconnected the battery and trackpad and connected the fan because I noticed the CPU heatsink heating up slightly and now can't get past 5V 280ma on all ports besides the trackpad side one way the connector gives 5v 280ma, the other way the board does not turn on at all, XAVbus fuse near the corresponding CD is 0v and the board takes 0 amps. Tried without my USB C meter as well to make sure that wasn't trolling me again than checking the fuse near the CDs to check whether it's 20V or not and there still 5V.\n\nChecked the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> LDOs all of them seem present, so either the ISL has gone or me leaving the battery connected for a while to charge up killed something."
