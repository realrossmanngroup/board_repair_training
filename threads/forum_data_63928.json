History is its chassis was completely crushed trackpad and screen were shattered not sure how but it seems like it was ran over. Board visually seems fine doesn\u2019t look warped no visible cracks in anything board side.\n\nwent through the power sequence diagram on logiwiki for the 01055 because there doesn\u2019t seem to be one for the 1987? All rails up until pp3v3s5 are present. Found out that pp3v3s5 and pp1v8s5 are coming on when you first connect the board but they shutdown after around 15 seconds or so.It seems like the PMIC is detecting a short on a minor sub rail and shutting down.\n\nso the question is are there any signature faults with the PMIC and the 820-01987? Unfortunately I do not have a thermal camera so I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s a shortcut I can follow. Freaking seeks have gone from 500 to 900 hence why I\u2019ve been putting it off, not to mention we don\u2019t do much of this so it\u2019s hard to justify spending a grand for a once in a blue moon job.\n\nthanks for the assistance!"}

I noticed the same when I was working on that 1958 a while ago. The large cap on the left side of the nand in the photo above is C8751 what do you think those three TPs with the blue squares are? Being behind the CPU there probably supposed to be quite low resistance I'm guessing, but not 0.002 ohms so I'm guessing there what the issue is but unfortunately the only other way to test those lines is remove the T2\/PMIC shield which I really want to leave as a last resort. \n\nSorry forgot to mention that in the original post. It is not recognized in DFU. That said the only mac we have is a A1708 which only will upgrade to Monterey, I tried upgrading it further, but it says it's not supported via the app store so not sure if you can \"force\" upgrade these or not. I did use the master port on the 1987 and tried both ports on the A1708. I have not tried forcing DFU via the test pad because the rails were shutting down I assumed there's further board level faults not firmware faults.\n\nYes I checked diode mode on all the coils. The CPU ones seem a little low comparing them to open board data, but there within 15% which I'm hoping is just meter differences\/board differences and not a dead CPU. Is this board one of the ones that is required to have a working CPU to get 20V?\n\nJust checked now yes S3 & S0 are also pulsing. Checked PP1v_s3 & PM_SLP_S0_L. I did not check them earlier as the S5s were pulsing. \nSomethings burned out as when I went to check ALL_SYS_PWRGD the USB C meter now is only outputting 5V 0.200A in all 4 orientations of the usb c cable.\n\n Damaged tracks definitely but I doubt it's a knocked off component. Physically board looks fine, normally if there's knocked off components you can see a part of the pad or the component torn or remaining, but everything looks normal. There are some components \"missing\" for example R5929 that whole row is missing and not marked as no stuff in the schematic. As is the row of R5569. As are the caps in the vertical assortment in between those row's ex C5569 and again not marked as no stuff in the schematic."}

Nothing, but a 98W apple charger and apple cable connected so that side should not be a issue. I haven't tried without the usb c meter though so I could try that but then you would have no indication of boot unless I connect it back into the chassis.\n\nPP1V8_AWAKE dips down for a split second once the PMIC shuts off but comes straight back up and is stable. PP1V8_SLPS2R does the same. Once the PMIC shuts off the board settles into 20v and bounces between 0.0138-0.0161a.\n\nAll signs are indeed pointing to T2 firmware issues, so is it worth forcing the device into DFU mode? It does not seem to be in DFU mode itself so it will have to be forced. I do not want to do this though as I'm concerned the A1708 I have won't be able to detect it. Looking at both logiwiki and the repair wiki both note you must be on the latest MAC OS which obviously the A1708 does not support. Unfortunately, we don't have any newer macs to use."}
