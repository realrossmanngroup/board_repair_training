It is missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> i have no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_EN</SIGNAL> i have no <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_EN</SIGNAL>. serious liquid damaged corrosion throughout the board. i replaced anything that looked fried/ burnt. the boards fan spins for a second then turns off. if i smc by pass the fan stay on.  <CHIP>U4800</CHIP> are was corroded. replaced it and no change. ppbus is good at 12v."
