            "message": "So this is an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> Touchbar and I'm stumped. Here's what I know.\n\nI'll preface by saying when I purchased the board, I saw that <RESISTOR>R6907</RESISTOR> and <DIODE>D6902</DIODE> were physically damaged (burnt on the top). I replaced both of them with exact replacements. That was the only visible damage I could find after inspecting every component with a microscope. There are no shorts to be found.\n\nWhen you plug in the board, it communicates with the charger, and we see 20V. It's drawing 200mA, but never more. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is good throughout the entire board, all of the 3.3v lines are good, there are no shorts on any of the power systems, so I'm at a loss! All the information online is about fixing the 3.3v lines or the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> chips, or stupidly obvious shorts in components.\n\nThe only strange thing I noticed is that there is 8.3V on <SIGNAL>P3V3G3H_VBST</SIGNAL> which comes out of <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> which is directly connected to the burnt components I replaced. I figured <SIGNAL>P3V3G3H_VBST</SIGNAL> would be a 3.3V line based on the name. But on the other side of <CAPACITOR>C6907</CAPACITOR> (pin 2) we're back to 3.3V, which electrically confuses me. This made me think maybe <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> was toasted, but it's happily outputting 3.3V.\n\nWhat do I do!?"
