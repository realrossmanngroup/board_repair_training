            "message": "Hi guys i got a Retina 13 inch with no audio. Apply hardware test via D key gave \"display & audio\" error. Apple EFI ASD test gave all good. Machine does have no audio, no info shows in \"about this mac\". Only found a liquid spil on <RESISTOR>R5489</RESISTOR> but didnt look too bad. <CHIP>U6201</CHIP> area looks very clean. Is the audio fail related to display and maybe to <RESISTOR>R5489</RESISTOR>? 3.3v and 1.5v make it to <CHIP>U6201</CHIP>. Any suggestion?"
