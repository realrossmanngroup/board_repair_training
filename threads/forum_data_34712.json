        "message":"Hi guys i got a Retina 13 inch with no audio. Apply hardware test via D key gave \"display & audio\" error. Apple EFI ASD test gave all good. Machine does have no audio, no info shows in \"about this mac\". Only found a liquid spil on R5489 but didnt look too bad. U6201 area looks very clean. Is the audio fail related to display and maybe to R5489? 3.3v and 1.5v make it to U6201. Any suggestion?"
