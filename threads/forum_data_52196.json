A bit more searching and [URL=\"https:\/\/www.diodes.com\/assets\/Datasheets\/PI3USB32212.pdf\"]https:\/\/www.diodes.com\/assets\/Datash...I3USB32212.pdf[\/URL] is the closest thing I've found so far with chip info, so USB 3.1 Mux\/Demux (looks like more pins on short ends..).\n\nAs its a 2 Thunderbolt model I'm guessing that burned pin is a fair place to start.\n\nHoping someone can identify that pin connected to the burned pad so I can run a trace wire."
