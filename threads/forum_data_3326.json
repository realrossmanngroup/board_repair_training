        "message":"I have a board that suffered a liquid spill 9 months ago. Board did not have any heavy corrosion, was surprisingly clean. \nWhen I connect a MagSafe, it lights up green but the board does not power on. \n\nIt powered on one time after the cleaning...and stayed on. Booted to a folder with the ? mark. I shut it down and it never powered on again after that. \n\nTried power on pads and plugging in the MagSafe without the battery connected. \nThis will be the first power issue I'm trouble shooting and I only have experience with the backlight circuit so far and I am looking for some guidance as to where to begin. \nDo I test the one wire circuit first? \nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks guys!"
