It was booting fine albeit with camera not working if communication between PCH and camera IC was disabled (removing <RESISTOR>R2030</RESISTOR> or removing the caps on the PCIe bus for example).\n- The clock did look fine on the oscilloscope, correct frequency and proper amplitude. Just a lower duty cycle than a known good board.\n\nAs a side note, removing camera RAM didn't change the symptoms, but once <RESISTOR>R2042</RESISTOR> was replaced it booted fine without camera RAM. Obviously camera wasn't working, but after reballing camera RAM everything works.\nPrior to finding the bad <RESISTOR>R2042</RESISTOR>, multiple camera IC were tried by Alan. I tried a known good clean ME EFI and clock generator, they didn't solve the problem in this case but they could cause similar symptoms anyway.\n\nAccording to Alan, with verbose mode Sierra/Mojave were freezing on :\n[CODE]AppleCamIn::init\nAppleCamIn::probe\nAppleCamIn::start[/CODE]\n\nI booted Big Sur in verbose and I didn't get these messages, it was freezing at :\n[CODE]IOG Flags 0x3\nGeneration from SMC report as 2[/CODE]"
