        "message":"Hi,\n\nI have an A1370 -820-3024-B, that has green light, but no fan spin and no power. It consumes 10mA on bench PSU.\n\nEven though I get a green light, on PPBUS_G3H, I only get 0.500V. \n\nDiode reading on PPBUS_G3H = 0.485\n\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.4V\n\nAlready tried a new DC in board, with same result.\n\nCan you help?"
