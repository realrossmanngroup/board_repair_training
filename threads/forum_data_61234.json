When turned on, all voltages are present. The fan starts only once for a few seconds and stops, while even with strong heat it does not turn on to cool the processor. If you unplug the trackpad cable and turn on the laptop, the fan starts immediately and gradually picks up maximum speed. There is no sound from the speakers. A couple of times, after several switching on and off, he still showed an image, and I moved the lid to understand if there was a problem in the matrix cable or not. I did not notice any artifacts and image distortions, so the problem is not in the matrix cable. In the photo, I indicated what voltages are present on the board. When the laptop showed the image, all voltages were the same as I indicated in the photo. Please tell me what the problem is.\n[SPOILER=\"Photo\"][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"screenshot_1.7eJBc.png\"]59893[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"screenshot_3.YLSqz.png\"]59894[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"screenshot_4.KRzEO.png\"]59895[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"screenshot_5.kUcf9.png\"]59896[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"2.png\"]59897[/ATTACH][/SPOILER]"

Now we can conclude that the problem is precisely in the board. I compared the voltage of the CPU, and noticed that on the working board it is + 1.04V. I ask for help to diagnose it correctly and repair it. Thank you."
