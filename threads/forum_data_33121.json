Thunderbolt ports do nothing. HDMI port Causes the screen to flash on and off as if it is connecting and disconnecting from a display.\n\nNo Signs of Liquid Damage on board. Board was very dusty and looks like it had some sand on it. A tiny bit of what looks like a liquid residue on the top thunderbolt port. \n\nSame issues with good display. \n\nApple Hardware test passes no issues found. \n\nI'm lost on where to start with this. Any ideas?"}
