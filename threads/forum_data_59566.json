No obvious liquid spill but some green probe points from humidity\nWill always power from battery, however if using charger only behaviour is random\nSometimes no green light, sometimes green light but no boot, sometimes it'll boot like normal\nOnce on it will stay on.\nMy PP3V42 is there, but I could swear it sometimes takes a few seconds to come up\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is sometimes 12.2V, sometimes 12.6V.\n\nThis is very weird behaviour and I don't see anything obvious around SMC or <CHIP>U6900</CHIP>.
