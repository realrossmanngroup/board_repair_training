I first got the board and noticed it had water damage across different parts of the board, mainly backlight, and some parts of the thunderbolt hardware as well. However, the CPU has a tiny little chip on the PCB of the CPU, on the edge of it. No bigger than a small grain of rice, it is fact though, chipped.\n\nCPU would not turn on due to <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4</SIGNAL> issues, however I managed to fix them. After that, it was near impossible for the board to fully power on. It would power on, but show symptoms of a bad BIOS or SPI ROM issue, like with the actual chip itself. I replaced the chip, flashed a whole new clean BIOS, clean ME, and the board did in fact power on. However heres the strange part. Im now booting Apple Diagnostics, and its telling me the thunderbolt controller, and other parts of it are not functioning. I thought this was weird because im using a TBT to HDMI adapter while testing. I then tried booting my test OS, and it would get stuck near the end of the loading bar and never finish loading. I then proceeded to run Apple Service Diagnostics OS, and ran it in verbose mode. I then noticed it would panic with \"ME DETECT\" \"FAILURE MISSING ME\"\n\nME problem, ok then, lets reflash. Reflashed with donor board bios, and cleaned me, and same issue. Used ANOTHER, donor board bios chip, and bios with clean ME, same issue.\n\nSo here we are, any ideas? Ive also attached photos."

However it slowly will take more Mah, 5 min has gone by with it still being plugged in and its now at 235 mah.
