PP3V42 is usually either 1.5V or 2.2V with no correlation to anything I can tell.\n\nBoard is on bench and checked with Main flex cable removed also and tried with different DCIN board.\n\nThings I tried: replacing <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>\nPulled <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>, <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>, SMC. Thoroughly inspected areas with direct pp3V42 connection. NO change in PP3V42 with any of those components removed.\n\nAlso get 1.2V on <SIGNAL>PP1V2_VDDC_SMC_S5</SIGNAL>\n\nReplaced L7095 also.\n\nChecked with FLIR also... not seeing anything unusual but suspect this is not major short. I get .313 in diode mode on pp3V42"
