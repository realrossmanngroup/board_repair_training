PP3V42 is usually either 1.5V or 2.2V with no correlation to anything I can tell.\n\nBoard is on bench and checked with Main flex cable removed also and tried with different DCIN board.\n\nThings I tried: replacing U7090\nPulled U7100, U1900, U5110, SMC. Thoroughly inspected areas with direct pp3V42 connection. NO change in PP3V42 with any of those components removed.\n\nAlso get 1.2V on PP1v2_VDDC_SMC_S5\n\nReplaced L7095 also.\n\nChecked with FLIR also... not seeing anything unusual but suspect this is not major short. I get .313 in diode mode on pp3V42"}
