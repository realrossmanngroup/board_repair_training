Components near the edge, r4510, u5410, c5411 and the ISNS_HS_OTHER_N circuit, seemed to have most of the corrosion. Further, the resistors smc_kbc_mde, smc_tdo, smc_tck and smc_tdi were all replaced due to corrosion. All the resistors in the area check out, and no shirt to ground. Any idea? Anyone?\n\nAlso, one of the RAM cards was wrecked."
