Components near the edge, <RESISTOR>R4510</RESISTOR>, <CHIP>U5410</CHIP>, <CAPACITOR>C5411</CAPACITOR> and the <SIGNAL>ISNS_HS_OTHER_N</SIGNAL> circuit, seemed to have most of the corrosion. Further, the resistors <SIGNAL>SMC_KBC_MDE</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>SMC_TDO</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>SMC_TCK</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SMC_TDI</SIGNAL> were all replaced due to corrosion. All the resistors in the area check out, and no shirt to ground. Any idea? Anyone?\n\nAlso, one of the RAM cards was wrecked."
