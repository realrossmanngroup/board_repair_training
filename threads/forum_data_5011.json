If that is ruled out inject voltage on PPBUS and see what heats up. Start with 1V and slowly go up if you can't find it."}

So, I tried connecting up the power supply which went into limiting immediately. Turned it up slow, no heat, turned it up a little more, no heat..... Decided F* this board and passed 25W through it. Can you guess what got hot?.......... The fucking power supply :)\nBoard was cool as a cucumber\n\nTo blow an 8A 24V fuse, what are the chances of a short on an inner layer(s) you recon?"}

Could be internal short in the board yes."}
