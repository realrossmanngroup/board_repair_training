Also some in the UB400 area.\n\nReplaced a few capacitors affected by the liquid but no changes.\n\nWhen board is booted you can hear the chime, see the apple logo on internal LCD but no progress bar ever appears. Using known good battery and apple original a\/c adapter.\n\nWhat should be checked next??"}
