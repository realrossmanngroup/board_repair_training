Dear god I hope you aren't buying boards on eBay. If you are, then there's your answer. Probably all have bad CPUs."}

Definitely not as robust as the non-retina boards. I don't know what it is about the design or characteristics of the CPUs, but they seem to have a lot higher rate of CPU failure than previous models."}
