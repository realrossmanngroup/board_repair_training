        "D7105": "What is D7105? Diodes between PPDCIN_G3H charger voltage and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, when CHGR_DCIN Is low(less than charger voltage) and PPBUS_G3H is missing this is a critical point to troubleshoot.",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",

This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. ."

            "message": "So I have a 15\" retina, finally something worth fixing. However, has been eaten alive by coke I guess.\n\nWell, decimated the thunderbolt circuit and charger circuit. The Diode <DIODE>D7105</DIODE> has only pin 3 pad left, but 1 and 2 are gone. I want to focus on these two first.\n\nI am trying to figure out the best way to connect pins i and 2 on the diode. (need some advise here) Is there a way to connect them without running a trace to the resitor on the other side of the board? Can i attach them both to the probe point #528 and soldier the two legs on the diode together?\n\nI will be replacing all the components on the charger dc in circuit, i have it all prepped and ready to be replaced, the traces seem intact. (so far)\n\nThe rest of the board seems visually fine, but when the charger gets plugged in it sparks, so i am sure this is just the beginning .\nI have attached a photo of the schematic page where the damaged occurred  [ATTACH]2306._xfImport[/ATTACH] [ATTACH]2307._xfImport[/ATTACH]"
