I have managed to work out its a 820-3126 logic board on this iMac although only by comparing its layout with what 820 logic boards sell as a logic board for an A1311 - I haven't removed the board yet and I think the actual board number must be on the hidden side. Ive just had success cloning the old spinning HDD to an SSD using CloneZilla on a PC avoiding any S.M.A.R.T errors.\n\nSo I'm quite happy at the moment and just wondering if the grounding of the pin on the ADATA SU630 was upsetting operations and should be left to float.\nI am about to put that SSD back in the iMac and wonder if I will see more S.M.A.R.T errors reported."}
