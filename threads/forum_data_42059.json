Freezes every single time on this exact test; tried several test assemblies, and confirmed the issue is 100% board-related (i.e. other boards in the same test assemblies do not freeze, etc). Tried both USB ports and multiple USB drives of ASD to be sure. Eliminated all of those and am confident the issue is board-related.\n\nThe camera itself DOES work in OS, and board works fine otherwise. I'm inclined to send it off as is, but I try to make sure all tests pass without issues. Any idea where I should start? Diode readings all match a working board, and the camera does work. Tried the obvious PRAM\/SMC resets, of course.\n\nAll help appreciated--thanks in advance!"}
