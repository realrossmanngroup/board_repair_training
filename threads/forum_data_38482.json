No liquid that I can see yet. This computer turns on, chimes, shows Apple logo then shuts down right away. \nTried with two different batteries.\nPPBUS is at 13V when charger is plugged in. 11.75V on battery. \nSMC issue??\n\nThanks guys."}

It must have been shorting the power pins. Replaced it and its booting to OS again. But now I have no internal KB in system report. Nor do I have USB on the I\/O board. Also missing Wifi, but I do have BT. Wierd. USB on Board works.\n\nTP Works. Have a replaced U4820 because the corroded pins on the KB connector led to it."}

IO is original.\n\nUpdate - Tried with new IO board and wifi and usb is good now.\nTried board in a different shell with known working KB. Still nothing. In System Report under SPI it shows \"Internal Apple Keyboard\" (sorry I was mistaken when I said it wasn't showing in the previous post, I was looking under USB for it. My bad.)  I have pp3v42 on pin 4 and 3v3 on pin 30 but still KB is not working. Only power button. \n\nThanks Guys, have a good one."}
