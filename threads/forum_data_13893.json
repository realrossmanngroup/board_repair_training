The board has no green light. I cant measure any Voltages i want. Nothing at DCIN Fuse, no PP3V42, no SMC_BC_ACOK or PPDCIN_S5_CHGR. So i don\u00b4t know what to check next. Could it be the SMC? \nI noticed, that after i plugged my charger in i need to completely unplug it from the wall and wait few seconds until the charger will work again with a good board. If i once plug it into this it\u00b4s like a dead charger. But at other Boards it works perfectly fine - no unplug from wall needed.\nI measured Adapter_Sense witch jumps between +0,000V and -0,000V. At the moment i plug the charger in (only if i unplug it from the wall before, of course) i can measure at pin 1 & 2 of J6900 a spike of 0,384V for a second. Thats the only sign of life from this board. No evidence of water, soldering etc. \nThanks for any help!"}

Yes i tried different DCIN boards but no success (and this DCIN board works with other boards just fine too). Q7065 has 0,000V to ground at pin 1-3. Pin 4-8 are not shorted. Is that normal with no charger plugged in? As far as i can tell the only natural Part to ground from there are Q7030 and Q7035 but these should be closed with no voltage on the gate as they are n-channel (so no way to ground here) or did i miss something? Could that be the short causing this problem?."}

I came to this conclusion but i\u00b4m not sure if its right. So, after i exchanged C7030 the short was gone and the charger was no longer tripping, but still no green light. I can hear a silent clicking sound coming permanent from the board and sometimes the green light appears for a second if i plug it in. This sound i heard not the first time and often it was a bad transistor pair of the buck converter (from my experience), so i exchanged Q7030 and Q7035 too, but still no green light.I checked PPBUS_G3H and it  was not there. Voltage came in pin 5 of Q7030 but not out of pin 1-3 because on pin 4 was 0V. CHGR_UGATE is not there which comes from U7000. Also CHGR_ACOK is not there and not shorted (so no green light). I measured around and R7001 is shorted on both sides too, so U7000 is not told to turn on. Also R7010 has Voltage at pin 1 but a short at pin 2 and R7002 is shorted on both pins too (but it should only be connected to GND on pin 2). These 3 resistors are all good, so my conclusion was that the only path to ground here is U7000 (or at least 3 caps around it must he shorted). So i ordered a new U7000. I hope my troubleshooting process is not completely garbage. I just don\u00b4t want to steal your time for every step that i maybe can solve myself."}

I wanted to do measurements yesterday but i couldn\u00b4t - so i can get back to this on monday i hope. But i already did a little research and have a question. Can the problem with CHGR_ACOK occur because U7000 is not powered right? (CHGR_DCIN not there). And is there an equivalent part to D7005 on some other board?

I learned from Louis videos that this can be related to current sensing. So i checked R7020 (it was fine ~2 Ohm) and R7021 and R7022. R7022 was 20 MOhm and R7021 was 1,8 KOhm.

It has 8,12V at pin 5, so Pin 3 is connected to pin 4 = GND (multi meter beeps). If i disconnect the charger it is not beeping anymore , so i assume Q6915 is fine and the problem is the 8V at pin 5 of Q6915. R6913 - R6916 are all below 270k Ohm. U6915 has 8,13V at pin 1, 0V at pin 2, 0,012V at pin 3, 8,12V at pin 4 and 16,66V at pin 5.
