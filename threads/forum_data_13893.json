Nothing at DCIN Fuse, no PP3V42, no <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> or <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_S5_CHGR</SIGNAL>. So i don´t know what to check next. Could it be the SMC? \nI noticed, that after i plugged my charger in i need to completely unplug it from the wall and wait few seconds until the charger will work again with a good board. If i once plug it into this it´s like a dead charger. But at other Boards it works perfectly fine - no unplug from wall needed.\nI measured <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> witch jumps between +0,000V and -0,000V. At the moment i plug the charger in (only if i unplug it from the wall before, of course) i can measure at pin 1 & 2 of J6900 a spike of 0,384V for a second. Thats the only sign of life from this board. No evidence of water, soldering etc. \nThanks for any help!"

So, after i exchanged <CAPACITOR>C7030</CAPACITOR> the short was gone and the charger was no longer tripping, but still no green light. I can hear a silent clicking sound coming permanent from the board and sometimes the green light appears for a second if i plug it in. This sound i heard not the first time and often it was a bad transistor pair of the buck converter (from my experience), so i exchanged <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> too, but still no green light.I checked <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and it  was not there. Voltage came in pin 5 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> but not out of pin 1-3 because on pin 4 was 0V. <SIGNAL>CHGR_UGATE</SIGNAL> is not there which comes from <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Also <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL> is not there and not shorted (so no green light). I measured around and <RESISTOR>R7001</RESISTOR> is shorted on both sides too, so <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> is not told to turn on. Also <RESISTOR>R7010</RESISTOR> has Voltage at pin 1 but a short at pin 2 and <RESISTOR>R7002</RESISTOR> is shorted on both pins too (but it should only be connected to GND on pin 2). These 3 resistors are all good, so my conclusion was that the only path to ground here is <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> (or at least 3 caps around it must he shorted). So i ordered a new <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. I hope my troubleshooting process is not completely garbage. I just don´t want to steal your time for every step that i maybe can solve myself."

Voltage there is 5,09V on both pins. <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> is jumping fron 3,2V to 3,9V. <SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> is too. I learned from Louis videos that this can be related to current sensing. So i checked <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> (it was fine ~2 Ohm) and <RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR>. <RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR> was 20 MOhm and <RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR> was 1,8 KOhm. I replaced both and PPBUS is now back 12.6V. So <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> are now also steady 3,9V / 16.3V. Also <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is there. Its 3,27V. PP3V42 is also 3,41V. But still no green light."

Pin 6 has >3V on it. <TRANSISTOR>Q6910</TRANSISTOR> has 6,72V at pin 2 so 16V can pass from Pin 1 to Pin 6. But <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR> is also opened. It has 8,12V at pin 5, so Pin 3 is connected to pin 4 = GND (multi meter beeps). If i disconnect the charger it is not beeping anymore , so i assume <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR> is fine and the problem is the 8V at pin 5 of <TRANSISTOR>Q6915</TRANSISTOR>. <RESISTOR>R6913</RESISTOR> - <RESISTOR>R6916</RESISTOR> are all below 270k Ohm. <CHIP>U6915</CHIP> has 8,13V at pin 1, 0V at pin 2, 0,012V at pin 3, 8,12V at pin 4 and 16,66V at pin 5. So if Pin 3 is normal (but it can´t be different as <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> is 0,012V as well and <RESISTOR>R6920</RESISTOR> is fine) i would blame <CHIP>U6915</CHIP> here."
