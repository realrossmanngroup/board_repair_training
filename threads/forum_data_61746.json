        "PPBUS_3GH": "What is PPBUS_3GH? PPBUS_3GH is a typo of PPBUS_G3H. If you see someone type PPBUS_3GH assume they meant to type PPBUS_G3H.",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

It works, gives image on external monitor, and with a flashlight on the back, it shows image.\nI don't understand this readings:\n\nOn F9700 I get 0V on the pad 1 and it seams that <SIGNAL>PPBUS_3GH</SIGNAL> is shorted\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_3GH</SIGNAL> = 0V 0 ohm and 0V on diode mode.\n\nBut everything seams to be working besides the backlight.\n\nAlready removed F9700 with same readings.\n\nCan you help?"
