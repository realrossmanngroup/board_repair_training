I'm not very familiar with this model\n\nI disconnected the webcam side of things... but still no change unfortunately.\n\nThe screen looks perfect with Apple logo, and at the login screen, until I input the password, then it goes very dim.\n\nHowever, a correction - the brightness slider bar does actually respond, and it does have some slight effect on the screen brightness- going from fully off to about 1\/4 of the normal brightness. \nI just cannot get it brighter than that, once logged in.\nThat is both with the webcam connector connected or disconnected. \n\nIf I select Restart, or shutdown, the screen will remain dim, i.e. the Apple logo and login screen will be dim, unless I reset the PRAM first. \n\nI also tried with another installation of OSX Big Sur, and booting from a Catalina USB installer, all behave similarly.\n\nOne thing I did notice, is that immediately prior to the screen dimming, the actual colours change for 1\/2 a second, like some sort of graphic artificing, then the screen dims.\nFor example, the White Apple logo on the black background will flicker to a white logo with a red background, then the screen will dim, and the colour will return to normal....\n\nI've attached a 10 second video of the issue.\nThe glitch occurs 6 seconds in.\n\n(For some reason .MOV files cannot be uploaded here directly, so I had to put it in a zip file).\n\nIt makes me suspect perhaps an issue with the GPU...."}
