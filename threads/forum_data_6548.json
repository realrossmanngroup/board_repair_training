I saw some spill damage by R7151\/R7152.\nI UC'd the board and used an SSD i had laying around since the original ssd had some damage to it and it won't boot from it. I was able to login and get to the system information page and it says the battery is not charging and needs to be replaced.\n\nThe part of the battery that goes into the battery connector has some of that milk in the crevices and I have tried scraping out as much as I can.\n\nIn resistance mode I measured pins 17\/18 & 27\/28.\nPins 17\/18 - 3.4 ohms\nPins 27\/28 - 20.1ohms\n\nEverything around U7100 look fine visually and all the probe points are still gold.\n\nShould I replace R7151\/R7152 since Pins 17\/18 should be 2.2ohms?\n\nHere is an image of the system information page.\n[URL=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/q0351csf72el1q9\/IMG_2656.JPG?dl=0\"]https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/q0351csf72..._2656.JPG?dl=0[\/URL]"}

Try and find an original one and not a replacement type. This one has an A1496 battery."}
