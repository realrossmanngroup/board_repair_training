When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

I saw some spill damage by <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR>.\nI UC'd the board and used an SSD i had laying around since the original ssd had some damage to it and it won't boot from it. I was able to login and get to the system information page and it says the battery is not charging and needs to be replaced.\n\nThe part of the battery that goes into the battery connector has some of that milk in the crevices and I have tried scraping out as much as I can.\n\nIn resistance mode I measured pins 17/18 & 27/28.\nPins 17/18 - 3.4 ohms\nPins 27/28 - 20.1ohms\n\nEverything around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> look fine visually and all the probe points are still gold.\n\nShould I replace <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR> since Pins 17/18 should be 2.2ohms?\n\nHere is an image of the system information page.\n[URL=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/q0351csf72el1q9/IMG_2656.JPG?dl=0\"]https://www.dropbox.com/s/q0351csf72..._2656.JPG?dl=0[/URL]"
