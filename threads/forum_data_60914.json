            "message": "Arrived heavily liquid damaged from being left out in the rain. Board itself did not suffer too muvh liquid damage. Had to replace IO board and battery.\n\nAfter replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> and <DIODE>D3320</DIODE> board was powering into the OS but there was no sound.\n\nWhile measuring around for the no sound issue the board suddenly got stuck at 5v. Now, If board is plugged in with battery theres a steady 20V at 0 amp current draw. If board is plugged in by itself its stuck at 5v 0.7 amp\n\nAlready tried DFU restore but no response.\n\nPP3V3 is good 3.3 and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.30V\n\nWhat should be checked next??"
