The Macbook turns on but fan speen increases up to max and it is incredibly slow. Additionally the battery is not correctly recognized (Warning symbol on battery symbol) or charging or running from battery only.\nAlready tried a known good battery and repairing in DFU mode.\nUnforunately I dont know much about the behavior of the Typ-C MacBook Air models and owuld be happy for some help.\n\nThanks"
