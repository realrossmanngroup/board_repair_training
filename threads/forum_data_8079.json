It has stable (but low) main G3H voltage at 8.19V. It looks like the SMC is off. Using known-good side board and cable.\n\u2022 I have 3.42V going to the SMC.\n\u2022 No PP3V3_S5.\n\u2022 No SMC_CLK32K.\n\u2022 PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC is at 1.17V\n\u2022 SMC_EXTAL is at 1.3V.\n\u2022 SMC_XTAL_R is at 0V.\n\nNot sure what my next move should be.\n\n**Probably no point in uploading the pics since the forum upload settings are killing the resolution but I put them up anyway in case it might help."}
