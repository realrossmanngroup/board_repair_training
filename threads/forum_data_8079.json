It looks like the SMC is off. Using known-good side board and cable.\n• I have 3.42V going to the SMC.\n• No <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>.\n• No <SIGNAL>SMC_CLK32K</SIGNAL>.\n• <SIGNAL>PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC</SIGNAL> is at 1.17V\n• <SIGNAL>SMC_EXTAL</SIGNAL> is at 1.3V.\n• <SIGNAL>SMC_XTAL_R</SIGNAL> is at 0V.\n\nNot sure what my next move should be.\n\n**Probably no point in uploading the pics since the forum upload settings are killing the resolution but I put them up anyway in case it might help."
