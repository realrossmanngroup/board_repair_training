The Macbook enters S0 state but only for about 5 seconds, then comes from 500 man then goes to 6 mahs.\n\nAnother weird thing I'm noticing is PPBUS_G3H is at 9.28V, instead of the normal 8.6V, and when the Macbook goes to 6 mahs, PPBUS_G3H goes to 3.4V and gradually lowers.\n\nBoard has signs of liquid damage but none near or around the SMC, only little corrosion around C5126, but U5110 looks fine."}
