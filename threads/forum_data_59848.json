The Macbook enters S0 state but only for about 5 seconds, then comes from 500 man then goes to 6 mahs.\n\nAnother weird thing I'm noticing is <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is at 9.28V, instead of the normal 8.6V, and when the Macbook goes to 6 mahs, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> goes to 3.4V and gradually lowers.\n\nBoard has signs of liquid damage but none near or around the SMC, only little corrosion around <CAPACITOR>C5126</CAPACITOR>, but <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> looks fine."
