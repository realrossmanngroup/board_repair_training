No water damage of any kind.   Look like they just left the factory.\n\nUnit not switching to 20v  Thermal shows short on U7700 by quick looping\nShort located on C780B and C78201.\nPower injecting under thermal shows heat on the CPU on Pins AV29-32.\n\nIf I inject .8v and hold it so the PMIC does not loop the unit will turn on 20v.  But the CPU is toast anyway.   I am seeing this exact same fault on a regular basis.\n\nThought I would share. \n\nI may tool up the Metcal to try to swap a M1 to see if it can be done.  Problem is where do you get them.  All the donor boards probably have bad M1's anyway.   Caused by water damage of some kind.  I so love the SMC being integrated inside the CPU.   It is awesome!  I had a M1 pro with camera problems \"water damage\"  The schematic \/ board view showed a switch IC for the camera data but final production eliminated that part and the data lines run straight to the M1.   Can't be fixed.   God I love this!\n\nI am just going to work on old Tube gear and throw these MacBooks in the trash where they belong."}
