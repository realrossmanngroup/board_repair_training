        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

Board originally had no green light, no power, ppbus/dcin missing, no liquid.\n2. Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR>/30/35, ISL, <RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR>/22 and got my green light and fan spin.\n3. Noticed that with (known-good) battery connected, board won't show green light. If I unplug battery, then connect charger, green light is present.\n3. Board has green light without battery connected, and will keep green light if I connect battery after board is powered, and board will run from battery. If I plug charger in at this point, no green light again. If I connect battery then connect charger, I get no green light and no power (<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> missing).\n\nThought this was a pretty clear damaged SMC issue, but even a replacement SMC doesn't resolve issue. What am I missing here? I figured if green light works fine without battery, issue shouldn't be with <CHIP>U6900</CHIP>/<CHIP>U6990</CHIP>, right? \n\nAny help appreciated, as always. Thanks!"

Replaced it, got proper ~19.7ohm, but issue persisted. Realized that with the proper resistance there, <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> then got scorching whenever I'd have battery/charger connected (a hint I wouldn't have had without your tip on <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>!). Replaced <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> and all is well now.\n\nAny idea what would damage <DIODE>D7005</DIODE>/<RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>? Shit charger, or maybe proxy-damage from ISL (from shit charger), or something more? Really appreciate this one, one more for me to document! Thanks so much, Duke."

I checked back at my <DIODE>D7005</DIODE>, and noticed some odd diode readings (machine off for 10 minutes before these taken):\n\n<DIODE>D7005</DIODE> diode: pins 1/2: .627; pin 3: .540\n\n<DIODE>D7005</DIODE> on a working board: pins 1/2: 1.80; pin 3: .548\n\nSo, pins 1 and 2 are way off of a working board.
