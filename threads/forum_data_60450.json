        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "U3900": "What is U3900? a CHIP.",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP1V35_CAM": "What is PP1V35_CAM? PP1V35_CAM is a 1.35v power rail to power the webcam. .",
        "C4003": "What is C4003? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C4002": "What is C4002? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
