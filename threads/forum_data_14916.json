Ive ran round the schematic on the pp3v3_sus line checking everything its connected too. theres  no other rails that could cause it thats connected via a 32ohm resistor unfortunately.\n\nIve removed all Active chips apart from the PCH (for obvious reasons on these boards)\nIve removed some of the passive components however its super rare that capacitors would go 30ohm short. \n\nThinking im digging too deep and should give up.\nGot any final ideas?"

New chips are stupid expensive too. :\/"
