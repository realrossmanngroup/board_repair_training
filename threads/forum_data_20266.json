            "message": "I got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3662</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board in today that would not power on. There was no liquid, and no drop damage evident. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was .60v, and there was a short present on PPBUS. I removed F7140/F7141 and injected voltage into PPBUS. I finally noticed <CHIP>U7310</CHIP> getting warm (<SIGNAL>S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL>). I removed it, and the short was gone. I replaced it, and the short was still gone, and the board powered on. I put the board into a test-case, and the board powers on but does not chime. Light on a mouse works, so there's VCORE, but no other activity. CPU feels cold the whole time, and there's no sign of life on the LCD (it doesn't activate and there's of course no backlight or anything). No life other than fans spinning.\n\n<CHIP>U7310</CHIP> being shorted has me somewhat hopeless, but is it possible the CPU is NOT dead? Right now I'm pretty sure it is.\n\nAny help appreciated!"
