The Mac runs mostly normal but has strange pauses like when loading boot option screen there seems to be a long pause. I can format and erase the drive in OS install screens. Install starts and either goes to black screen or with other OS gets stuck early on restart\/load screen and then boots back to install OS stage. No corrosion around SSD connector. Runs good with external OS.\n\nDIode tested all SSD port pins red to ground and compared to working board and everything looks very good there. Tried a different SSD also, same result.\n\nNot sure where to go from here..."}
