When only fan and DC-in board/power cable is plugged into motherboard, I get fan spin that gradually accelerates as well as a green-then-orange light on charging cable. When the macbook is fully assembled, I do not get any lights on the charging cable or signs of life from computer. The main power rail is present, any ideas on where to look? Thank you."

Both phases are present and at proper voltages. CPU is getting warm when board is out and adapter is plugged in. Also, after further testing, I have realized that P3v3S0 is missing from all points I tested on the board. Found the <SIGNAL>3V3_S0</SIGNAL> switch (<CHIP>U8030</CHIP>) and found that the <SIGNAL>P3V3S0_EN</SIGNAL>  signal is missing. It is my understanding that this switch is what sends the signal to CPU to activate S0 (on) state. Since the enable signal for this switch is missing, then the chip would never tell computer to actually switch to on state. Am I understanding this correctly?"

I took a bunch of measurements and observed operation. With board installed into computer, I get a green/orange light, but no fan spin and no other signs of life. When the board is external with only fan and DV cord plugged in, I get green/orange light as well as fan spin and a warm CPU. Main power rails are active and I took some measurements and thought I would record some of the more important ones here to help with troubleshooting:\n\nVcore present:\n3v3 enable at <CHIP>U8030</CHIP> present\nAll 5V rails present for S5-S0 states\n5VS5 present at <CAPACITOR>C7505</CAPACITOR>\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S0_L</SIGNAL> present at pin 1 of <CHIP>U1420</CHIP>\n3V present at pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R8162</RESISTOR>\nAlso verified that all S3 rails for each state are present as well\n\nFor the most part it seems as if the power rails are active and present. Any more ideas on where I should check? Heck it could even be hardware at this point but I am pretty sure I ruled that out already."
