This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",

I am digging into the forgotten boards from the past that I could not figure out and seeing if I can fix any of them.  \nThis one helped me learn how the BIOS and PCH works.  What I do know.\n\nThe PCH is getting a good clock signal\nThe PCH is not stuck in a <SIGNAL>RESET_L</SIGNAL> state\nThe PCH is not sending the <SIGNAL>SPI_CLK_R</SIGNAL> signal and as a result is not reading the BIOS chip.\nThe PCH is getting the <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> signal from the SMC.\nAll the voltages appear normal.\n\nSo this one looks like the PCH.  \nAnyone have a second opinion before i donate this LB to the rework machine pile?"
