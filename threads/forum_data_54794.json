        "message":"Deep Tracks for LB repair.   I am digging into the forgotten boards from the past that I could not figure out and seeing if I can fix any of them.  \nThis one helped me learn how the BIOS and PCH works.  What I do know.\n\nThe PCH is getting a good clock signal\nThe PCH is not stuck in a RESET_L state\nThe PCH is not sending the SPI_CLK_R signal and as a result is not reading the BIOS chip.\nThe PCH is getting the PM_PCH_PWROK signal from the SMC.\nAll the voltages appear normal.\n\nSo this one looks like the PCH.  \nAnyone have a second opinion before i donate this LB to the rework machine pile?"
