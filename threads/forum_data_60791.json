        "message":"HI,\n\nI have an A1466 820-3437-B with no power. It had liquid contact (a bit of coffee, not much), and i replaced the U1959, C1950 and R8167 that had a bit od corrosion,  but with no sucess. It had the J6100 with a lot of corrosion, and I have taked it out.\nIt has green light, but no fan spin, and it consumes 95 mA on PSU.\n\nThe SYS_PWROK_R test point is missing and don't know if it is essencial  (it had corrosion and disappeared when i cleaned with IPA), and i have 0V on SYS_PWROK_R.\n\nCan you help?"
