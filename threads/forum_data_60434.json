Battery still needs to be replaced so wasn't able to completely see how it might perform. \n\nIt will not allow an OS to complete installation on internal. \n\nI believe this is due to a memory module error from AHT is [SIZE=4]4mem\/60\/40000000: 0x7b224f90. \n\nAny chance anyone knows what RAM chip that references?[\/SIZE]"
