(Card B has been happily rendering Vectorworks stuff for the past 7 years, it seems funky for it to die in my careful hands today)\n\nMaybe it's friday, but this shit is killing me.\n\nMuch obliged"

That 6970 is going to die very soon like they all are doing as it is now cooking itself.\n\nAll the cards will give an image at least. How many LEDs are lighting up now? Need to remove the tape from the LEDs to see them on 09/10 machines."

Should I tell client A to install some fan control software, cause I think that he will want to keep it for rendering.\nI know about the leds, I’ve taken all of the tape off and on all machines only the first two light up. Will doublecheck tomorrow when back in the shop."
