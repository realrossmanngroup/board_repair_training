        "A1708": "What is A1708? A1708 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2017, 2016 with EMC 3164, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00840, 820-00875..",
        "PPV_OUT_S0": "What is PPV_OUT_S0? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q8400": "What is Q8400? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "Q8401": "What is Q8401? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "BCK_FET": "What is BCK_FET? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
        "LID_OPEN": "What is LID_OPEN? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT": "What is HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT? HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT is a signal from the hall sensor on the RIGHT side of the machine that indicates that the lid has been closed. This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen."

This morning nothing on display for about five minutes, I go away for a bit to find a torch to see if it's just no back-light and the laptop is on again and running.\n\nGiven the intermittent nature of the issue how do I start diagnosing ? \n\nAre there any known / common problems with this laptop ? I've head of the stage light issue but not sure if it applies here. \n\nCheers\n\nJames\n\nPS Will update post if I determine if it's backlight / video / no power."
