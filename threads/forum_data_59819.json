This morning nothing on display for about five minutes, I go away for a bit to find a torch to see if it's just no back-light and the laptop is on again and running.\n\nGiven the intermittent nature of the issue how do I start diagnosing ? \n\nAre there any known \/ common problems with this laptop ? I've head of the stage light issue but not sure if it applies here. \n\nCheers\n\nJames\n\nPS Will update post if I determine if it's backlight \/ video \/ no power."}
