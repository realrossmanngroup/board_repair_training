    "definitions": {
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "DP_INT_HPD": "What is DP_INT_HPD? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN? EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is necessary to enable the power rail that powers the LCD screen image circuitry. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "U9850": "What is U9850? a CHIP.",
        "EDP_AUXCH": "What is EDP_AUXCH? a SIGNAL.",

Bare board boots ok to OS on external.\n\nScreen seems detected, <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is high as is <SIGNAL>DP_INT_HPD</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>.  I can't make out an image but I seldom can with these.  I looked under the scope for moving LCD pixels etc...  Different screen same story (genuine 2017 screen)\n\nI'm not too sure what to check next, backlight is not being enabled, but i've already checked the fuse (fine, 12.56v both sides) and <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> (missing).  No short on PPVOUT Backlight"
