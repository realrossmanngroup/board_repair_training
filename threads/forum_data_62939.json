Bare board boots ok to OS on external.\n\nScreen seems detected, EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is high as is DP_INT_HPD and SMC_LID.  I can't make out an image but I seldom can with these.  I looked under the scope for moving LCD pixels etc...  Different screen same story (genuine 2017 screen)\n\nI'm not too sure what to check next, backlight is not being enabled, but i've already checked the fuse (fine, 12.56v both sides) and BKLT_EN (missing).  No short on PPVOUT Backlight"
