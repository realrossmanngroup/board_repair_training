It is wierd that only in smc bypass mode I get  backlight and image for a couple seconds, but trying to boot it normally it doesn´t turn on the backlight... what could make the board to shutdown? I checked temperature and current sensors and everything seems to be ok.\n\nA little detail: When it turns on, it starts at 600-700ma then it goes down to 360ma and starts to go up by 10ma until it gets to  390ma that´s the point where it turns off. When it turns off <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> goes as low as around 7.8v. I dont think that is normal behavior..."
