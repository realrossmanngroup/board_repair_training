Sometimes it will stay up for 30minutes but usually it continuously chimes. It seems it is losing power as the backlight goes out and the fan stops spinning then it powers back up and goes again.\n\nSMC_RESET and SMC_ONOFF both maintain their readings through a restarts although once I saw SMC_RESET_L slowly count down from 3.375 till it rebooted at close to 0."
