Sometimes it will stay up for 30minutes but usually it continuously chimes. It seems it is losing power as the backlight goes out and the fan stops spinning then it powers back up and goes again.\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL> both maintain their readings through a restarts although once I saw <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> slowly count down from 3.375 till it rebooted at close to 0."
