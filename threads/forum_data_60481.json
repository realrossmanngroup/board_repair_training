No obvious liquid exposure. I removed F7000, injected 2 V at <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, which heated up the CPU power MOSFET <TRANSISTOR>Q7960</TRANSISTOR>. I removed <TRANSISTOR>Q7960</TRANSISTOR> and localized the short to <SIGNAL>PPVCCIO_S0G</SIGNAL> (< 1 Ω). I tried injecting 1.2 V at <SIGNAL>PPVCCIO_S0G</SIGNAL>, but nothing seems to get warm after a few minutes (10 A power supply). How can I definitively say the CPU is shorted?"
