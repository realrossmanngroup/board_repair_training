        "message":"I have an 820-4924 that had an absolutely mangled U7100 area. I replaced everything and had to run wires for both R7151\/R7152 and R7121\/R7122. I've measured all the components and have continuity throughout, but it's still at 16.5V. R7151\/R7152 is connected to R7150 and pins 17 and 18. And R7121\/R7122 is connected to R7120 and to pins 27 and 28. So my question is, what is the most likely reason that I would still be getting high voltage like that?"
