        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "R7121": "What is R7121? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

I replaced everything and had to run wires for both <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR>. I've measured all the components and have continuity throughout, but it's still at 16.5V. <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR> is connected to <RESISTOR>R7150</RESISTOR> and pins 17 and 18. And <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR> is connected to <RESISTOR>R7120</RESISTOR> and to pins 27 and 28. So my question is, what is the most likely reason that I would still be getting high voltage like that?"
