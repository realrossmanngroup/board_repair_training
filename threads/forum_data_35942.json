Since the bios chip looked badly soldered im assuming it was changed.\n\nupdate: just noticed on about mac it says its a 11inch macbook this is a 13 inch so for sure someone swapped the bios chip. Can i reprogram this one or should i get the correct bios chip from a similar board?\n\nupdate 2: so i found the correct bios dump online for this board i also found an easy clean me.exe online and using the me region repository for my version of me region (figured out by using me analyzer) I ran the easy clean me.exe on the bin found online. Then using a hex editor i edited the serial number and the secondary board number thats on a sticker and starts with c222 reflashed it onto the bios chip and its still slow. Maybe the easycleanme.exe didnt do its job? I know im supposed to use the fict tool but i have had no luck finding it. Any tips?"
