        "message":"Hello,\ni am working on two waterdamaged machines. I could get both up and running but now both have every second Backlight LED not turned on, so that there are visible black shadows on the bottom of the screen. I tried different screens and they have the same issue. I have no idea where to look in a case like this. Both had waterdamage in the backlight area and i cleaned everything and replaced a lot of stuff including LP8550 on both. Is it ok to ask for help for both here in one post as they have the same issue or should i open another one for the second? Thanks for any advice!"

I totally missed that...  Sorry for the dumb question i just never heard of LED return lines before this one so at least i learned a lot from you. Thank you very much."
