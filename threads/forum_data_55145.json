Green and orange light and shows charging but under system settings it says no charge. Tried a new battery same issue. Measured all resistor around U7000 all seems OK. Resistance between pin 17-18 3.8ohm and between 27-28 21ohm. DC in 16.45v and AC 3.9. No short on PPBUS\n\nR7080\/81 ok\nR7021\/22 ok\nR7010\/11 ok\nR7021\/22 ok\nR7051\/51 ok\nR7005 ok\n\nReplaced ISL 3 times, last time with one that came from a working board just to make sure. After replacing ISL not booting, 4V on PPBUS. I know it is usually caused by current sensing circuit, but I cannot find any issue yet, ideas?"}
