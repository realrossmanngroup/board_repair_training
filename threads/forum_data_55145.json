        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

Green and orange light and shows charging but under system settings it says no charge. Tried a new battery same issue. Measured all resistor around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> all seems OK. Resistance between pin 17-18 3.8ohm and between 27-28 21ohm. DC in 16.45v and AC 3.9. No short on PPBUS\n\n<RESISTOR>R7080</RESISTOR>/81 ok\n<RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR>/22 ok\n<RESISTOR>R7010</RESISTOR>/11 ok\n<RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR>/22 ok\n<RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR>/51 ok\n<RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> ok\n\nReplaced ISL 3 times, last time with one that came from a working board just to make sure. After replacing ISL not booting, 4V on PPBUS. I know it is usually caused by current sensing circuit, but I cannot find any issue yet, ideas?"
