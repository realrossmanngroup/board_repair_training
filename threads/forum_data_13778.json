        "820-3209": "What is 820-3209? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",

        "U9000": "What is U9000? a CHIP.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

        "PPBUS_SW_LCD_BKLT_PWR": "What is PPBUS_SW_LCD_BKLT_PWR? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

The customer has sent this back saying the backlight will only turn on after like 10 or times of turning the machine on and off. I have the machine back and there is no backlight and I can see when I flash a light on the screen.\n\nThis was the previous topic I created [url]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/12250-solved-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3209</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-no-backlight-no-feedback-continuity[/url]\n\nThe backlight voltage from LCD connector shows from 7.49v to 8.36v. In diode mode Pin 2 of <DIODE>D9701</DIODE> and <CAPACITOR>C9799</CAPACITOR> show 0.599v.\n\nTo fix this board I scratched a little next to A5 feedback ball put some solder there and ran a wire to Pin 2 of <DIODE>D9701</DIODE>.\n\nShould I try putting a new <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> on the board?"
