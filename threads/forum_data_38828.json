            "message": "Ok guys. My first problem to post and I hope you will be able to help with this.\n\nThis is a 2010 Macbook Pro 17\" that I purchased from a someone this week. Sold as 'not charging, tried 2 different chargers' and I took the chance on the basis they probably did not know you had to use an 85w magsafe. Anyway, got it, plugged in and green light straight away which is always nice. Battery is no good, so cannot tell about charging as such yet. Have checked both current sensing circuits for DC in and battery, both check out fine.\n\nOn removing rear cover I immediately honed in on two red flags. One, the fans were spotless. Two, flux around <CHIP>U7201</CHIP>. Someone has been telling uncle Jimmy porkies!!!!! Clean fans usually means someon has been in and doing something, albeit just cleaning someone has been in here first which I hate.\n\nSo, to the problem so far. Have <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> at 8.4v. Have pp3v42 obviously and needless to say DC in etc. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> at C75205 was coming up at 0.7v.\n\nStraight to that <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> for a closer look and although it seems to be the original (no tweeer marks) and seemed to soldered well, replaced it as a matter of course. Whilst it was removed I measured pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R7901</RESISTOR> for EN signal and got a nice steady 3.3v as hoped. On fitting <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> that dropped to 2.4v. Replaced <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> again just to be sure chip wasn't bad and got exact same result.\n\nPin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C7205</CAPACITOR> is showing 0.772v with both the new chips.\n\nA little bit baffled by this one. Racking my brains so ANY pointers will be gratefully received.\n\nThanks\nJimmy"

If I opt for sound (short to ground etc) I get JUST that, sound or nothing but no ohms . If I measure without sound it displays only in volts. Does that sound correct?. So, that in mind here we go:\n\nAnd yes, I do measure resistance/diode mode with power off.\n\nL7260 is showing 0.5v in diode mode on my (crapo) multimeter\nL7220 is showing 0.4v in diode mode on my (crapo crap crap) multimeter\n\n<CHIP>U7201</CHIP>:\nPin 12 is showing 2.7v\nPin 22 is showing 3.0mV\nPin 22 is showing 7.2v\n\nJust been reading the online manual for my multimeter and it seems that in diode mode it measures the forward voltage of a diode.

            "message": "Good morning everyone\n\nThis board actually got to me during the night. See if you can follow my line of thought here.\n\nThe mac had obviously been worked on by someone before as there was flux around <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> and perhaps I should have walked away on seeing that. But like most of us I get a huge buzz if I can fix a board, especially those ones.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is the same (7.2v this morning) wherever I check it, which would not make any sense otherwise, so you are quite right to question the different figures that I hope I explained in my previous post. But what has got to me is the low voltage (near enough zero) on pin 22 of <CHIP>U7201</CHIP>. That connects to <CAPACITOR>C7203</CAPACITOR>. If that was shorted to ground, that would explain something so I removed it to check. Pin 2 of <CAPACITOR>C7203</CAPACITOR> is supposed to be ground, pin 1 is not. But pin 1 solder point (with cap removed) is shorted to ground. Mmmmmm... Now I am on to something me thinks....\n\nPin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C7203</CAPACITOR> goes to pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R7248</RESISTOR>. Pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R7248</RESISTOR> goes to Pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R7249</RESISTOR>, which in turn pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R7249</RESISTOR> goes to ground - a voltage divider if I am not mistaken. Problem is <RESISTOR>R7248</RESISTOR> is shorted to ground on both pins, so is <RESISTOR>R7249</RESISTOR>. What the.......? No wonder Pin 22 of <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> is showing next to nothing!\n\nNOW. Looking at the schematic and I think there is one of Apple's printing errors. Can anyone confirm if it is just me, but <RESISTOR>R7248</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7249</RESISTOR> are both listed as zero ohm? Effectively shorting straight to ground.\n\nI am just wondering if the previous person to attack this board replaced the originals with zero ohms because the schematic says so? Obviously the originals would have been correct. Two zero ohm resistors in sieries is not an voltage divider, but the techical term I believe is 'a wire'.\n\nAm I losing my mind, or have I found a bit of a problem?\n\nSo, if anyone can have a look at their schematic and tell me what <RESISTOR>R7248</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7249</RESISTOR> should actually be or an educated guess what be good so I can replace those two, eliminate the short on <CAPACITOR>C7203</CAPACITOR> and hopefully we can restore life into this old mac after all?"
