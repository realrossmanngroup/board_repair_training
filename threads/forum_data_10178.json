Same.\nAlso I re-checked those resistors. R7005 was too high 300ohm instead of 20. Not sure why I missed that before. I changed it, now it is 20ohm as it should but nothing changed.\nThere is something weird that might be relevant information: when i plug the charger in another laptop and put it back the charger light returns. It remains even after a few attempts of connecting and disconnecting from IO board. It start the fan for 2-3 seconds then it stops.\n\nI fixed that retina board 2 days ago that was behaving somewhat similar by reballing the SMC. Does it worth a try in this case??"}

If R7005 was dead then the ISL was also killed. This only happens with crap Chinese chargers like this. It may have killed the SMC also. Check for corrosion, but this may be a dead SMC."}

Nothing changed. Changed the SMC too.
