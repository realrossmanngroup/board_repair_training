Found corrosion on by and around <RESISTOR>R3108</RESISTOR>. Cleaned up the corrosion, confirmed the resistors were good. Also replaced <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> (2 times to confirm replacement chip wasn't DOA). This didn't fix.\n\nReplaced all 4 USBC port chips with the same issue. \nStarted ohm'ing around and found 1.8ohms on LA640. Removed both LA640 and 650, still reading 1.8 on on LA640(2). Is 1.8 too low or is the GPU shorted?"

It looks like its the board view for <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00281</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. To the left of <RESISTOR>R3109</RESISTOR> is a 100Kohm resistor. So when i saw this resistor, i assumed it was taking the place of <RESISTOR>R3109</RESISTOR> (<RESISTOR>R3109</RESISTOR> was actually missing). Anyway, went ahead and installed the 1Mohm resistor for <RESISTOR>R3109</RESISTOR> and that did the trick. \n\nSo, this also means that 1.8ohm resistance reading on LA640 and 650 are the expected reading. \n\nAnyway, thanks for the assist."
