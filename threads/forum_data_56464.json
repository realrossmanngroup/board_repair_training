        "message":"Hello\n\nHave this board that caming in with no power. 5.18v on PP20V_USBC. U3200, UB300, UB400 all cycle when power is applied to their port. U3100 is steady at 5.18v. Found corrosion on by and around R3108. Cleaned up the corrosion, confirmed the resistors were good. Also replaced U3100 (2 times to confirm replacement chip wasn't DOA). This didn't fix.\n\nReplaced all 4 USBC port chips with the same issue. \nStarted ohm'ing around and found 1.8ohms on LA640. Removed both LA640 and 650, still reading 1.8 on on LA640(2). Is 1.8 too low or is the GPU shorted?"

        "message":"you were right. Found a missing resistor that's not called out in the schematic or board view. It appears the board view for this board isn't correct. It looks like its the board view for 820-00281. To the left of R3109 is a 100Kohm resistor. So when i saw this resistor, i assumed it was taking the place of R3109 (R3109 was actually missing). Anyway, went ahead and installed the 1Mohm resistor for R3109 and that did the trick. \n\nSo, this also means that 1.8ohm resistance reading on LA640 and 650 are the expected reading. \n\nAnyway, thanks for the assist."
