It has no oxidation, it just had a short on C7434. I replaced it and the board turned back on. But if you connect the battery, the board turns on and off in a few seconds, sometimes it doesn't even turn on.\n\nI already tested with another battery, with another DC card. Same thing!\nI have the 3V42_G3H with the battery connected\nI already checked the C7105 and the traces of the R\/D7105\nR7121\/22 and R7151\/52 are OK."}
