After check voltage , I didn't see <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4</SIGNAL> so dedicate replace <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> and bingo!! <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4</SIGNAL> come back and S0 rails come . But now no CPU Vcore enable :(\nWhen checked cause see <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> signal isnt there... Injected <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> line 3v CPU VCore comes,fan spin and usb mouse light is ok but no internal and external screen :( \n\nSo i thing first problem is <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>  why isnt there... measured <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> around all voltage is ok. replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> nothing change. \n\nAny idea for next step...\n\nThanks"

My board is BJT version so <CHIP>U7960</CHIP> place is empty ( i ll check <RESISTOR>R7967</RESISTOR> not sure) .\nAlso measured power rails when injecting fake <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, only T29 line 0 volt but I know this line for thunderbolt so if i didnt connect anyting this port its will be off...is it corect?  T29 line must be any voltage when port is empty ?"
