After check voltage , I didn't see PM_SLP_S4 so dedicate replace U1800 and bingo!! PM_SLP_S4 come back and S0 rails come . But now no CPU Vcore enable :(\nWhen checked cause see ALL_SYS_PWRGD signal isnt there... Injected ALL_SYS_PWRGD line 3v CPU VCore comes,fan spin and usb mouse light is ok but no internal and external screen :( \n\nSo i thing first problem is ALL_SYS_PWRGD  why isnt there... measured Q7950 around all voltage is ok. replaced Q7950 nothing change. \n\nAny idea for next step...\n\nThanks"}

My board is BJT version so u7960 place is empty ( i ll check R7967 not sure) .\nAlso measured power rails when injecting fake ALL_SYS_PWRGD, only T29 line 0 volt but I know this line for thunderbolt so if i didnt connect anyting this port its will be off...is it corect?  T29 line must be any voltage when port is empty ?"}

Also you replaced the PCH so now the BIOS must also be flashed with a clean ME!! Only needed after you get it to work of course."}
