Same issue.\n\nI've replaced the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>, but same issue.\n\nLooking for a short on the rails, I believe I have one on <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3RS0</SIGNAL> (0.04 on diode mode).\nWhen I remove <TRANSISTOR>Q7801</TRANSISTOR>, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> will stay on.\n\nThere are a few parts on this rail and the CPU, of course...\nI will try to remove all the caps and chips on this rail and hope for the best.\n\nWhat do you guys think?"
