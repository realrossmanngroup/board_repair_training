            "message": "i bought this Mac on eBay so I can learn how to fix macs. Issue is with the charger I have a faint green light and no fan spin. I ended up replacing <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> do to having a short.   Once I replaced the Ic I was able to get proper voltage. \n\nAs as of now I have the following:\n\n<CHIP>U6901</CHIP>: 3.42vdc pin5\n<CHIP>U6900</CHIP>: 3.42vdc pin1\n             3.42vdc pin 5\n             3.41vdc pin 4\n\nat this point I have no clue where to go next. Thanks in advance."
