I have an 820-00165 that has no green light on the charger, PP3V42 is .43V and PPBUS is .5V. I checked PPDCIN which is 18v and pin 4 of Q7010 which has 6.8V on it so I assume that is working based on measurements taken from another board. I also checked and do not have any short on PPBUS so I am wondering if U7100 is causing my issues."}
