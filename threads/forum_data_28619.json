            "message": "Computer came in after red wine was spilled on it the night before. Inspected the board and replaced all corroded components. Then applied power and got a spinning fan without chime or video. Fan went high and stayed high. Then after cleaning a bit I noticed that traces from <RESISTOR>R5177</RESISTOR>/78 to SMC were shot. I repaired the traces here and still had the same issue. Figured if the traces to SMC were that badly burnt that the SMC was most likely fucked as well. I then replaced the SMC and the board booted normally with chime and video but no backlight. Upon troubleshooting that backlight circuit I noticed a small white dot in F7700. Tested for continuity and found the fuse was dead, as this was one of the areas hit with liquid so it wasn't a surprise. After replacing the fuse and checking for short I applied power I got very faint backlight for a split second then it went off. This caused F7700 to go dead again or maybe the fuse was bad, Im not sure. Replaced F7700 again and I now have 8.56V on both sides. Only problem is now I am back to no chime and no video.\n\nPPBUS -8.58V\nPP3V42 -3.42V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> - 8.58V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> - 16.5V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.34V\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 3.34V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_WAKE_L</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\nCPUVCORE - 1.6V\nUSB Mouse lights up.\nWas able to PRAM with external KB before but now I cant really tell.\nIs not doing 1,2,3 fan spin at the moment.\n\nDamaged areas were <CHIP>U3210</CHIP> area, Bottom of SMC, <TRANSISTOR>Q3025</TRANSISTOR> area, <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> & <TRANSISTOR>Q7010</TRANSISTOR> area, <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> area and F7700 area.\nConfused because everything was working before I replaced the fuse and I have a really hard time with \"No video, no chime. Coincidence?\n\nThanks in advance. Have a good one."

LOL.\n\nAfter not really getting anywhere with this board (mainly because I suck when it comes to anything to do with clock/bios) I decided to put it in the cleaner to get a better look at it. Well that did help because I found a tiny hole I didnt see before in (TP) <SIGNAL>PCH_CLK32K_RTCX1</SIGNAL>. I checked for continuity back to <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> but there isn't any. The TP is too frail and I cant seem to get a wire on it. So I think Im Fucked seeing that this is the only way to access this line. Thanks anyway for your help Duke. Have a good one."
