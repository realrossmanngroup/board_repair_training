This can be bad LED driver, this can be feedback line from backlight output to ball A5 of the LED driver for feedback being destroyed(VERY COMMON). Also BKL_EN voltage divider being bad - you need at least 2.7v on BKL_EN or you get no boosting and wind up with 8.5v on backlight, which is just PPBUS_G3H being passed through the circuit.\"\n\nI've replaced the LED driver, with no change.\nHowever, I just noticed that BKL_EN is 0 Volts.\nR7730 is 200 Ohms\nR7715 is 100 OHMs, both as per schematic...\n\nAs BKL_EN shows 100 Ohms to ground, it is not shorted to ground.\n\nPPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT must therefore be missing, I'm assuming?\nI'm a little confused as to the source of BKL_EN - there is only one single reference to it in the schematic.\nIt appears to be created by PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT.\n\nAny suggestions appreciated."}
