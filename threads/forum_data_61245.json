        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

This can be bad LED driver, this can be feedback line from backlight output to ball A5 of the LED driver for feedback being destroyed(VERY COMMON). Also <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> voltage divider being bad - you need at least 2.7v on <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> or you get no boosting and wind up with 8.5v on backlight, which is just <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> being passed through the circuit.\"\n\nI've replaced the LED driver, with no change.\nHowever, I just noticed that <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> is 0 Volts.\n<RESISTOR>R7730</RESISTOR> is 200 Ohms\n<RESISTOR>R7715</RESISTOR> is 100 OHMs, both as per schematic...\n\nAs <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> shows 100 Ohms to ground, it is not shorted to ground.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> must therefore be missing, I'm assuming?\nI'm a little confused as to the source of <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> - there is only one single reference to it in the schematic.\nIt appears to be created by <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>.\n\nAny suggestions appreciated."
