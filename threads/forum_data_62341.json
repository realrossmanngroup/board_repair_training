        "A1707": "What is A1707? A1707 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3072, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00281, 820-00928..",
        "820-00281": "What is 820-00281? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7650": "What is U7650? a CHIP.",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "P5VS4_EN_RCD": "What is P5VS4_EN_RCD? a SIGNAL.",

        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
