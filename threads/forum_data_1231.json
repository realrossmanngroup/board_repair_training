The AC In adapter is working fine on several boards but not in this one.\nThe fan is spinning and it chimes, but no backlight, no image.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is present but sometimes not, that is why I need help I don't know why this is happening.\n\nI will explain myself better:\n\nWhen I plug the charger green light: PPBUS_G3H is 16,78v for example, then I plug again the charger and I got only 1,6v on pubs_g3h\n\nWhere can I start?"}
