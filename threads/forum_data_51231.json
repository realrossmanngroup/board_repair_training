        "SSD_RESET_L": "What is SSD_RESET_L? SSD_RESET_L is a signal that puts the SSD in reset mode when it is low. This means the SSD will not be accessible when this signal is asserted.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v..",
        "SSD_PWR_EN": "What is SSD_PWR_EN? SSD_PWR_EN is a signal that tells the chip making the power rail for the SSD to turn on when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
