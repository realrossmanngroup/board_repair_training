            "message": "I got this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that was liquid damaged near JB500 area. I get 20v 0.09a on the charger and I have all my SLPS2R and AWAKE voltages. I do not have anything on my G3S rails. I attempted to boot it into DFU to try a T2 firmware restore but it would not go into DFU at all. After a while, I realized it is because <SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> does not drop when I press the power button. I soldered a wire to <SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> and was able to get the board into DFU mode by pressing the 3 buttons on the keyboard and holding the wire to ground. Unfortunately, DFU restore failed with error 4005 and the amps never moved passed 90ma. I would like to fix the power button problem first so I can try the DFU restore a few more times. Its a real pain to use a wire to trigger that signal and press the 3 buttons at the same time. There was some corrosion around <CHIP>U4901</CHIP> so I changed it but I still have the same issue. <SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_R_L</SIGNAL> is 1.7v and does drop to 0 when I press the power button, but <SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> is 3.3v and does not change when I press the power button. What would cause this?"

            "message": "Yea you were right. The trace for <SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> had no connection to pin 4 on <CHIP>U4901</CHIP>. I ran a wire to fix this and power button does work now. When I reassembled the board in the case, I connected a charged battery to it this time and now it takes 20v 0.01amps with both the battery and charger. When I pressed the power button, the fans started spinning and the internal LCD turned on with backlight only. I confirmed that I had USB activity and caps lock did light up. During this whole time, the USB meter still reads 20v 0.01 amp, so there seems to be an issue with the charger or charging circuit. Then after only like a minute of being on, the fans start spinning at high speed for 1 or 2 seconds and then it turns off completely and I am not able to get it to turn on again using the power button. I tried SMC bypass and it does not turn on still, but sometimes the fans will twitch a little, as in they move very slightly when I hold the power button down."

When I try with the battery connected, it actually appears to successfully complete the restore process. I do not get any errors, but the board still does not turn on.  I have not been able to get it to turn on again like I did before either."
