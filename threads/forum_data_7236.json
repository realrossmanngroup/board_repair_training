Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. ."

If you look in the operating system in about this mac, you can see if the OS sees a 60w or an 85w charger.\n\nIf <SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER_EN</SIGNAL> is not 3.3v, either you have an SMC related problem or you are using a fake charger.\n\nJust buy an original charger. You paid for a rework setup, you paid to set up your business, spend the $50 or so to get a charger that you can trust for testing."
