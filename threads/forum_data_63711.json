    "definitions": {
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7012": "What is D7012? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year model macbook airs, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "DCIN_G3H": "What is DCIN_G3H? a SIGNAL."

No fan spin.\n\nDisconnect AC adapter, connect battery--> fan spin and boot to desktop but NO trackpad or keyboard.\nConnect AC adapter and battery appears to be charging. Solid orange light on magsafe aletrnating with flashing green every 3 seconds.\n\nPPBUS G3H: 4.32V on AC ADAPTER\nPPBUS G3H: 6.91V on BATTERY\n\n\nSuspected DC IN leak:  <DIODE>D7012</DIODE> appeared cracked and shorted.\n\nReplaced it. Remove battery, attach AC adapter.\nGreen light flashing continues. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> bounces between 2.5V and 4.5 V.\nConnect battery.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> bounces between 6.90V\n\nStrange thing is that I started this whole sequence with the machine not working on battery and booting on AC power.\nNow I have the opposite but the trackpad and mouse dont work in either case.\n\nMy question now:\n\n?<TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>? does it need to be replaced.\nI don't have a stable correct <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> so the other option is start looking at <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>.\n\nI am assuming I have to back up and look at why I dont have <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>"
