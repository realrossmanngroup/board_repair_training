        "message":"Welcome to the new forum! :) \n\nOver the past five months, dealing with vbulletin\/paypal has been a nightmare. The payment method between vbulletin\/PayPal wasn't working - the IPN was trying to refer to an incorrect URL. vBulletin was passing the wrong information to Paypal. As a result, it seems PayPal has stopped sending IPN messages entirely, even with the new xenforo forum.. I spent about an hour on the phone with PayPal and it went nowhere, so I switched to Stripe for payments. All is now working. \n\nSo:\n\n1) If you want to sign up, after registering, go to [URL]https:\/\/boards.rossmanngroup.com\/account\/upgrades[\/URL] and pay through here. I think it might even support apple pay, but I can't test that(for obvious reasons :p).\n\n2) If you signed up in the past day or two using Paypal and it did not add you, let me know - email [email]forumhelp@rossmanngroup.com[\/email] , we'll refund you on PayPal and you'll have to sign up using a credit card with stripe. I realize how much of a miserable pain in the ass this is and wish I had dumped vbulletin when these issues first began in December. I am sorry. :(\n\n3) It seems most people can log in, but for a few people their old passwords are not working. If that is the case, email us FROM THE EMAIL YOUR ACCOUNT IS REGISTERED TO and we'll reset your password for you. \n\nI am sorry for all of these issues - this is inexcusably bad forum management on my part, and totally my fault."
