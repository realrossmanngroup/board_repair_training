Everything else works well, no issues in ASD. Replaced with known-good <CHIP>U3540</CHIP> (before I realized that ANY <CHIP>U3540</CHIP> being in place caused it to turn off), and no dice. No liquid damage, board simply began powering off during boot-up one day (according to previous tech notes).\n\nThanks in advance for any assistance."
