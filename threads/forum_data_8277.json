Everything else works well, no issues in ASD. Replaced with known-good U3540 (before I realized that ANY U3540 being in place caused it to turn off), and no dice. No liquid damage, board simply began powering off during boot-up one day (according to previous tech notes).\n\nThanks in advance for any assistance."}

I even replaced the connector just now to be absolutely sure it wasn't causing issues. No change. Does the fact that the board works fine with U3540 removed just mean that it's definitely the power for APT that's causing the issue?\n\nI might abandon this one. If anyone can solve it, I'll pay you $30.00 through PayPal. ;)"}
