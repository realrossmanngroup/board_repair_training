        "message":"Board came in liquid damaged primarily in the clock chip area. Had 8.58 on PPBUS, 3.42 on 3v42 and green light. Had 0 volts on PPVRTC_G3H. Replaced C1902, C1922, and C1910 because they looked bad as well as the clock chip. Now I have 3.42 volts on PPVRTC_G3H, 5 volts on PP5V_S5, but zero volts on PP3V3_S5. The only bad probe point I found was the one left of R2042 but it seems to have continuity to its corresponding spots. On the TPS, SMC_PM_G2_EN is 3.42 volts, P3V3S5_EN_R is 3.3 volts. What am I missing or where do I go from here?"

Went back to clock chip area pulled chip noticed PCH_CLK32K _RTCX1 pad was burned so ran jumper to corroded test point now have continuity and replaced clock chip again. Same problem no 3V3_S5. I'm really stumped on this at this point nothing else looks corroded or broken. Also PM_SLP_S5_L is missing checked all test points near BIOS all connect and all of the probe points look pristine. The only other probe points on the board that look anywhere near discolored are one by the SMC for SMC isense which I don't think is related at all and then the probe points below the CPU. Is this a time waster at this point?"
