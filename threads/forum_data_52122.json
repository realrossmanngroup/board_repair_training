All normal.\nUnit enters a S0 state for a split second. 0.25 sec. Appears to pull normal current but it's hard to tell with such a short sample time.\n\nU1930 does register (CPU_VCCST_PWRGD) and the input (ALL_SYS_PWRGD) does come up to the proper 3.3v\nPCH_SRTCRST_L is 3.3V\nPCH_RESET_L is 3.3v\nPCH_INTVRMEN is 3.3v\nPCH_INTRUDER_L is 3.0v\n\nUnit will register a SMC reset.\n\n\nI am looking at the SMC lines trying to figure out how it is being shut down.\nSuggestions?"
