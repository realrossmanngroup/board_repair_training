            "message": "Hello, I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01958</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> 2020 MacBook Air. The board is taking 5V .23 amps on both ports, not looping. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.3V. Corrosion was around the CD3217s. I have already swapped both CD3217s, as well as the ROM. I’m missing <SIGNAL>P5VG3S_EN</SIGNAL>. I have tried restoring with AC2. The device is recognized in DFU, and will exit it when it fails. It fails every time with “gave up waiting for DFU to transition to DFU State” error 4042. Under thermal cam, T2 chip gets warm faster than anything else, but still at 34 C, so normal temp. Any ideas on how to proceed?"
