When I connect the massage without the battery; the machine turns on and shows a x on battery symbol. In both scenarios I don't get a green light at the magsafe. I already tried a brand new I\/O board and cable\n\nPPVBAT_G30_CONN 0.22v\nSM_BUS_SMC_G3_SDA 0v\nSM_BUS_SMC_G3_SCL 0v\nPP3V42_G3H 3.42V\n\nThe diode mode reading on both SDA & SCL is .506\nThe resistance on pin 17 & 18 on u7100 is 3.8 ohms. \n\nIs this a garbage battery? Thanks!"
