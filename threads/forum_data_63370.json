I found a 2Ω short to ground on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H_SSD0</SIGNAL>, which I fixed by replacing the voltage regulator <CHIP>U9080</CHIP>. Now I am left with a short on <SIGNAL>PP2V7_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> (4Ω to ground). Injection of 2V into <SIGNAL>PP2V7_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> warms up all four NAND chips. Is there any hope that the SSD is not toast?"
