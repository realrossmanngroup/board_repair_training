        "message":"This 820-00850 board came in with missing SSD power rail PP2V7_NAND_SSD0. I found a 2\u03a9 short to ground on PPBUS_G3H_SSD0, which I fixed by replacing the voltage regulator U9080. Now I am left with a short on PP2V7_NAND_SSD0 (4\u03a9 to ground). Injection of 2V into PP2V7_NAND_SSD0 warms up all four NAND chips. Is there any hope that the SSD is not toast?"
