Look. Analyze. What looks broken? Is what looks broken near where there was corrosion before? What can I do to fix it? You have to have a natural curiosity towards life here to get something done!\n\nThat being said, read sticky on backlight, look at video on feedback wire. I'm not fixing this; you are!"

Nope, I have thousands invested now, so no way I am giving up.  I apologize for being so behind the curve here, but I will get this and then pass your guys help on to other newbs to forum hopefully.  I will keep you guys posted and I can't tell you how much I appreciate you guys and I hope to show that by becoming self reliant asap."

Forget learning right now and think monkey work. If you monkey it enough and probe shit, on occasion you will have eureka moments and shit will start to click into place in your head.\nSticky is at the top of the board repair forum"
