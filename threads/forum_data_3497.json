Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

I have continuity between all components so traces are fine. I get 12.6v but it constantly fluctuates. I went back to the <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> and I get 16.5v for a couple of seconds, then it fluctuates down to about 3.4 and jumps back up to 16.5v and repeats.\nI get the same result at <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR>\nAt <RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR> it drops to 15.8v on pin 2, at <RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR> it is at 16.5v all voltages fluctuate. The corresponding pins on <CAPACITOR>C7020</CAPACITOR> are the same 15.8v and 16.5v, So unless i am mistaken this is working correctly. Of course i am not really sure if it is supposed to fluctuate and the computer still has green and no orange with battery and will not boot.\nCharger A Gate is 17v\n\nAny ideas"
