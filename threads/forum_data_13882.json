Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

I cut off the bad damaged Thunderbolt area, replaced the SMC and a lot of other stuff. Now it has a green light and turns on again. The remaining problem is that it beeps if i take the ram out (speakers are ok) but wont chime. Also it has no Picture and no Backlight (missing <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> ; i already exchanged  <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> and the LVDS witch were damaged too) Could it be an SMC Issue (bad soldering or maybe bad SMC ; but it has a green light after the SMC exchange)? At this point i´m stuck.\nThanks for any help!"

While testing i noticed, that the HDD makes clinking sounds at the beginning and stays spinning after that and that after a minute or two if i leave it running the ODD makes its \"sound\" (the sound that it normally makes at the beginning of every Startup directly before the chime) but still no chime. Could it be one of the sensor issues, where the cpu is running incredible slow? I set it aside and let it run now for a few hours and look if it chimes later maybe..."
