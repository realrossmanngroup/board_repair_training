        "message":"Hello,\ni have problems with an 820-3115-B. The board had bad water damage and no green light. I cut off the bad damaged Thunderbolt area, replaced the SMC and a lot of other stuff. Now it has a green light and turns on again. The remaining problem is that it beeps if i take the ram out (speakers are ok) but wont chime. Also it has no Picture and no Backlight (missing LCD_BKLT_EN ; i already exchanged  LP8550 and the LVDS witch were damaged too) Could it be an SMC Issue (bad soldering or maybe bad SMC ; but it has a green light after the SMC exchange)? At this point i\u00b4m stuck.\nThanks for any help!"

        "message":"Yes, Vcore is there at 1.113V. With no ram installed it beeps 1x every few seconds. I tried with different ram sticks and every Slot on its own. While testing i noticed, that the HDD makes clinking sounds at the beginning and stays spinning after that and that after a minute or two if i leave it running the ODD makes its \"sound\" (the sound that it normally makes at the beginning of every Startup directly before the chime) but still no chime. Could it be one of the sensor issues, where the cpu is running incredible slow? I set it aside and let it run now for a few hours and look if it chimes later maybe..."

U4910 is missing 11 pads including the groundpad (the chip looked like a ball as i opened the machine the first time). So i thought that there is no hope for TB and that it would be better if no voltage is going in this circuit anymore. I did this after i restored the green light. After i \"cut off\" T29 the fan starts to spin."
