If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",

When track pad is touched it seems to lose connection or drop before pointer can be moved one place to another across the display.  Replace trackpad?  Board problem?  A nudge in the right direction is appreciated."
