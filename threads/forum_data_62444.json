Tried multiple screens but no difference.\n\nTook the board out and it seems that <TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR> is getting its 12.9v PPVIN on pin 4 but the hate voltage is also 12.9v on pin 3 so isn't opening.\n\nI can't seem to figure out why pin 3 isn't dropping.  The resistance between pin 4 and 3 is 80k so seems fine there.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated"

I just sorted it thankfully.\n\nIt tested as low ohms on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> so I decided to inject 5v into that line and have a look on FLIR\n\nThe issue was with capacitor <CAPACITOR>C8470</CAPACITOR> shorting.\nReplaced and now works fine.\n\nI was having an off day obviously for not just doing this sooner.\n\nThanks again"
