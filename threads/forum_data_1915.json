Maybe a little corrosion on <CAPACITOR>C3897</CAPACITOR>,\n\nI cleaned the whole board. After I dried it I attached the power cable and it turned on.\nI attached the speaker and I heard the dong sound. I put it back to the macbook and it didn't turn on.\nI disconnected all the cable except the LVDS cable. It still didn't power on. After I removed the LVDS cable it turned on.\nI tried with a different LCD same thing. I replaced the LVDS connector. Still nothing. It won't even try to turn on.\nIt doesn't do anything. Fan is not spinning. Nothing at all.\n\nI pulled the backlight fuse. I thought maybe something with the backlight circuit. No luck.\nI pulled [/FONT][/COLOR]L9004 and it turns on. Has backlight, but of course no picture. I checked everything for short or low resistance.\nI replaced L9004 and <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>. These didn't solve anything.\n[COLOR=#222222][FONT=arial]I pulled <CAPACITOR>C9011</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C9012</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C9015</CAPACITOR>. Same shit.\nI pulled <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> again and solder a wire from Pin 2,3 to Pin 4,5. The 3.3V rail is jumping up and down and it does not turn on.\nI know my test LCD is good. I just used it yesterday. Anyway I would believe something is wrong with the LCD.\n\nAny thoughts? [/FONT][/COLOR]\n\nThanks!"
