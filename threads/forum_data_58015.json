It did light up some alien lights only once when I first tested it but not anymore.\n\nI have been unable to get the correct schematic for this LA-C912P board, however the power circuit on previous model LA-B753P is very similar so I have been getting by so far.\n[url]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ETL3b2ZBRwC4uHk0IwFnCJj-Hap5TDwV\/view?usp=sharing[\/url]\n\nDoes anyone here have the LA-C912P schematic?\n\nThe main power supplies, 19V, 5V on PL102 and 3.3V on PL101 are present.\n\nPU300:\npin1, does not have 3V\npin7, 5V is present\npin10, has 4.59V\n\nU18:\npin1, 3VALW is present\npin2, 3VALW is present\npin3, 0.7mV\npin4, 5VALW is present\npin13,14, no output\n\nSo the BIOS UH4 is not getting it's 3V_PCH even after pressing the power button.\n\nThe other Winbond chips are getting 3.3V on UT2, UE2, UT5, these three Winbond chips ARE NOT ON THE LA-B753P board nor the schematic I've provided.\n\nThere does not seem to be any chips getting hot at all.\n\nWhat should I be checking next?
