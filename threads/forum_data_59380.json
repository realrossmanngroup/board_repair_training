I have taken some readings see below - Any idea.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12.61 Volts  -\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> - 12.61 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_GPU</SIGNAL> - 12.61 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_OTH5V</SIGNAL> - 12.61 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_3V3G3HRTC_X</SIGNAL> - 12.61 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCIO_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3_CPUDDR</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S0SW</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP2V5_S3</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_PRIM</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_T</SIGNAL> - 3.35 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> - 1.8 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> - 5.14 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL>-X - 3.3 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3S_T</SIGNAL> - 3.3 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3S_X</SIGNAL> - 3.3 Volts\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_TBT_X</SIGNAL> - 0 Volts\n\nI do notice on the below however when testing for a short to ground I get the below, the rest is fine.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_GPU</SIGNAL> - 12.61 Volts - 0.002 Ohms\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_OTH5V</SIGNAL> - 12.61 Volts - 0.002 Ohms\n\nWould this stop the MacBook Pro from powering on or taking a charge?\nI did read it could potentially be a faulty <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> Chip but my charger is negotiating 19.9v so surely this would not be the case?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this & reply."
