I have taken some readings see below - Any idea.\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.61 Volts  -\nPPBUS_HS_CPU - 12.61 Volts\nPPBUS_HS_GPU - 12.61 Volts\nPPBUS_HS_OTH5V - 12.61 Volts\nPPBUS_HS_3V3G3HRTC_X - 12.61 Volts\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 0 Volts\nPPVCCSA_S0_CPU - 0 Volts\nPPVCCGT_S0_CPU - 0 Volts\nPPVCCIO_S0_CPU - 0 Volts\nPP1V2_S3 - 0 Volts\nPP1V2_S3_CPUDDR - 0 Volts\nPP1V2_S0SW - 0 Volts\nPP2V5_S3 - 0 Volts\nPP1V05_PRIM - 0 Volts\nPP3V3_G3H_T - 3.35 Volts\nPP1V8_G3S - 1.8 Volts\nPP5V_G3S - 5.14 Volts\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC-X - 3.3 Volts\nPP3V3_G3S_T - 3.3 Volts\nPP3V3_G3S_X - 3.3 Volts\nPP3V3_S0SW_TBT_X - 0 Volts\n\nI do notice on the below however when testing for a short to ground I get the below, the rest is fine.\n\nPPBUS_HS_GPU - 12.61 Volts - 0.002 Ohms\nPPBUS_HS_OTH5V - 12.61 Volts - 0.002 Ohms\n\nWould this stop the MacBook Pro from powering on or taking a charge?\nI did read it could potentially be a faulty CD3215 Chip but my charger is negotiating 19.9v so surely this would not be the case?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this & reply."}
