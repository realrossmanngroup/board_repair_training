Is this the case for all caps?\nI only had Louis' video ( [url]www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/43322-2010-15-mbp-boots-but-fans-running-on-high-after-doing-<CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR>-kernel-panic-repair[/url])  go by, in which he scraped the negative terminal to make it larger.\nI must have a noob-type mental block here , since I simply cannot make sense of this: The 330 uf caps have 3 terminals, one positive and 2 negative: the 2 negative ones internally connected. So if positive goes on the left, as seen in the video, then why did he have to scrape the negative pad to enlarge? The negative terminal on the cap lands quite easily on the negative pad as it is? \nSo before I go and remove the cap, and replace it with a new one via iron, can you shed some light into my confusion here?\nMeanwhile my EFI test may take another 2 hours to do the DMA Full Read Scan at 1250."

That produced no change, so I switched out the trackpad cable as well. Then it booted , with normal fans, but some flicker on screen, which was caused by the display cable being a little dislodged. Fixed that by pushing it in all the way. Ran a partial ASD test , checked only the components which had shown error before, and it all came out PASSED. Humble bow into your general direction.
