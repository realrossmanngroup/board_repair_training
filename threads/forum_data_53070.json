Maybe the CPU survived.\nI checked all the CPU power rails resistance against my two answer keys \"working boards\" and they were similar.\n\nAfter replacing Q7900 I now have PPBUS_G3H back. \nHowever I am missing my P5S4_EN at U7650\n\nOnce I get into U7800 I am pretty much lost. \nThis is not a water damaged board.   Initial failure was Q7900 so I am guessing I have a PCH problem here!\n\nPMIC_SHUTDOWN_L 3.3v\nPP3V1 _RTC 3.1V\nSMC_LRESET_L 0.0v\nPM_SYSRST_L 3.3v\nS5_PWRGD 3.2v\n\nI am really kind of lost here.\n\nRTC_RESET_L 3.1v\nSYSCLK_CLK32_PCH \"nice square wave\"\nPCH_SUSACK_L 3.2\n\nyea...
