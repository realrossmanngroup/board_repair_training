        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",

Maybe the CPU survived.\nI checked all the CPU power rails resistance against my two answer keys \"working boards\" and they were similar.\n\nAfter replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q7900</TRANSISTOR> I now have <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> back. \nHowever I am missing my <SIGNAL>P5S4_EN</SIGNAL> at <CHIP>U7650</CHIP>\n\nOnce I get into <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> I am pretty much lost. \nThis is not a water damaged board.   Initial failure was <TRANSISTOR>Q7900</TRANSISTOR> so I am guessing I have a PCH problem here!\n\n<SIGNAL>PMIC_SHUTDOWN_L</SIGNAL> 3.3v\nPP3V1 _RTC 3.1V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LRESET_L</SIGNAL> 0.0v\n<SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL> 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL> 3.2v\n\nI am really kind of lost here.\n\n<SIGNAL>RTC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> 3.1v\n<SIGNAL>SYSCLK_CLK32_PCH</SIGNAL> \"nice square wave\"\n<SIGNAL>PCH_SUSACK_L</SIGNAL> 3.2\n\nyea...
