        "820-2915": "What is 820-2915? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "U9701": "What is U9701? a CHIP.",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "R9704": "What is R9704? a RESISTOR.",
        "R9693": "What is R9693? a RESISTOR.",
        "C9704": "What is C9704? a CAPACITOR.",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

Upon removing the several wires that are involved in the bypass, I was able to reprogram the gMux using DosDude's firmware update but now the display is not showing a backlight.\n\nLooked at <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> fail and I've checked <RESISTOR>R9704</RESISTOR> is 33ohms, <RESISTOR>R9693</RESISTOR> is 100k ohms, <CAPACITOR>C9704</CAPACITOR> is not shorted to ground.\n\nAlso checked Pin 2 on <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> (<CHIP>LP8550</CHIP>) that enable is 3.3V\n\n<SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> is only 8.8 mV, so I hard wired <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> to 3.3V and still no backlight\n\nAlso checked Output on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> is only set to 12.5v,\n\nI've reballed <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> hoping to resolve some poor connection on the pads but no difference, should I assume the Backlight IC is toast?"
