Does boot, but green light on charger.\n\nI disconnect battery, and try with just charger no luck.\n\nI investigated the other side of the board and found corrosion on <CHIP>U7840</CHIP> which I removed. \n\nSuccess! Computer now boots with battery and charger connected. BUT the keyboard does not work (I have to disconnect both charger and battery then reconnect to get a boot)\n\nand the Caps Light on Keyboard is always on.\n\nSimple case of keyboard replacement or trouble ahead?"
