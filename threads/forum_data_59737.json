But then <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> was then missing. Replaced SMC and i now have <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>. The board still isn't power up. I'm missing <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL>, with <SIGNAL>P5VS4_EN</SIGNAL> also at zero. But after about 2min or so of the MagSafe being plugged in, the board finally powers up and chimes. Any suggestions"
