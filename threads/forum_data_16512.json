This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
