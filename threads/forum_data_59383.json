        "message":"Hi, I have this mid 2012 13\u201d non retina here for repair. It initially wouldn\u2019t power on no green light or anything but it works using a charged battery. If I plug in a charger there is no light, although it does show the little symbol on the top menu bar under System profiler it detects a Charger but says not charging. Anyone got a clue what to look out for on these?"
