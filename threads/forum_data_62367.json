        "message":"Hey there :)\n\nI got this board with no liquid spill or any other signs, no knocked off components.\n\nInitially it used to start with 20v 150-300mA, staying for a few seconds and then bootlooping.\nI tried DFU mode, which it successfully enters, however it failed every single attempt to recover with \"Failed to restore device in DFU mode\"\n[ATTACH alt=\"PXL_20220221_114336114.jpg\"]60431[\/ATTACH]\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, it started giving a different error:\n[ATTACH alt=\"PXL_20220221_114800906.jpg\"]60432[\/ATTACH]\n\nThen I placed it back on the bench and now it only uses 40-70mA without any bootlooping.\nI already took some voltage measurements, please lemme know your thoughts.\n\nBig coils are at:\nL7670 - 5V\nL7690 - 3.3V\nL7030 - 8.6V\nAll other big coils at 0V\n\nPP1V_PRIM                                          0V\nPPVCORE_S5                                       0V\nP5VG3S_PGOOD                                1.7V\nP3V3_S5                                               0V\nPP1V8_S5                                             0V\nPPVCCSA_S0_CPU                               0V\nPPBUS_HS_CPU                                   12.6v\n\nPP_SSD0_S4E2_VPP                             1.30-2.60V (pulsing)\nPP0V9_SSD0_S4E2_VDD_PLL             0.90V\nPP2V5_NAND_SSD0                            2.50V\nPPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0                             1.80V\nPP1V8_IO_SSD0                                   1.80V\nPP0V9_SSD0                                         0.90V\nSSD0_S4E2_ANI1_VREF                       0.90V\nSSD0_S4E2_ANI0_VREF                       0.90V\nPP1V8_SSD0_S4E2_AVDD18_PLL      1.80V\nPP1V8_SSD0_S4E2_PCI_AVDD_H       1.80V"
