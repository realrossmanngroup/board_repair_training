        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP1V8_S0": "What is PP1V8_S0? PP1V8_S0 is a power rail that is present when the machine is in an S0 state, meaning it is fully turned on, not sleeping or hiberating .",
        "PPVCORE_S0_AXG": "What is PPVCORE_S0_AXG? This is vcore going to the CPU’s integrated graphics processor for CPUs that have an integrated GPU. When this is missing on a device that has an integrated GPU and no discrete GPU, it usually means either no screen is detected, or the GPU integrated into the CPU is dead..",
        "PP3V3_S0GPU": "What is PP3V3_S0GPU? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "PP1V2_S3": "What is PP1V2_S3? PP1V2_S3 is a 1.2v power rail present when the machine is in an S3 suspend to RAM state.",

        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
