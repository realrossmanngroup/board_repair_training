            "message": "Hi got this <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1534</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> 12\" 2015 Retina MacBook in for repair after a small spill over the Keyboard. My first ever 12\" Retina I've worked on. The Keyboard is completely unresponsive as well as the Trackpad. I was first tempted to replace the top case as these are absolutely notorious for their Butterfly Keyboards failing, but all Keys dead and a dead Trackpad seem to me like it could be a board level issue.... Don't have a second machine to swap the to case with for testing at the moment.\n\nAnyone ever seen this before?"
