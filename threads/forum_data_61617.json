            "message": "Got a bit of a strange one here <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00430</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> iMac 21.5\" Logic Board. \n\nWe have replaced the PSU in this iMac previously a few months back but it has been brought back in with no power - no lights on the logic board but the PSU is outputting 11.85V and <SIGNAL>PP12V_G3H</SIGNAL> is present. <SIGNAL>PP12V_S5</SIGNAL> is not however. \n\nI'm using the schematic for the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00034</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board as I cannot find one for the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00430</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> - would I be correct in assuming that <TRANSISTOR>Q6970</TRANSISTOR> is a likely culprit? My only confusion is that <TRANSISTOR>Q6970</TRANSISTOR> on the schematic is a 3 leg IC but on the board itself the IC in this position appears to have 8 legs?"
