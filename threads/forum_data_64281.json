It had prior liquid and prior board repair.. the work was done on UB300 area.. and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> cap CB300 was removed completely.. I suspected the liquid damaged that cap and Mr. repair man just popped the cap and it worked.. for a while at least and now its stuck at 5v.. \n\nI removed both and replaced both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> on that side to be sure 100%.. what's weird is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> on all board reads normal around 0.350ish on board.. except for CB300 where it's 0.550... \n\nWhat am I missing? help?"
