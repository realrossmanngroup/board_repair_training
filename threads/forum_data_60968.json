When i connect magsafe fan doesnt spin but board pulses all s0 rails for a second than stays in s5 state.\n\nIn SMC bypass fan spin and stop twice and than nothing happens.\n\n\nThe only rail not present when plug is  <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> (pulsing twice to 5V and goes to 0). Already checked and changed <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> with no result\n\n\nAny idea?"
