        "message":"Can someone shed some light on this. For some reason 8 out of 10 times after a board comes out of ultrasonic, it seems to be in worse shape then it was. Meaning, its clean and looks the same. Nothing missing. Just doesn't work. No fan spin. Most of the time after about a day it might start working again. Makes be crazy. For example, last night I took it out after 10 mins and let it sit in alcohol for about 20 mins. Then I dried it with my hot air station and let it sit overnight. When I came in this morning and tried to power it on, it was dead. After about a half hour, now the fan spins. No chime... just spins. Im guessing in about an hour from now it will start working again. Maybe not. \n\nIm using 4oz of EC to 1 gallon distilled. \n\nThanks. Have a good day."

What I do now is fix what has to be fixed, run it through, alcohol bath for 2 minutes or so, heat it with heat gun since I don\u2019t have small oven BUT keep it away from CPU\/GPU, and then take air can and blow out remainingalcohol underneath BGA chips. Haven\u2019t had one issue since I started blowing out the alcohol under chips"

Just brush corrosion away manually if you don't want to pay it, but don't break boards with bad cleaners. Personally I always just brush manually, the only reason why I would get a cleaner is to easier get rid of the flux on the board, but thats mostly just cosmetic..."
