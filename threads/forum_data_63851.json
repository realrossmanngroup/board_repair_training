            "message": "Hi,\n\nMy wife's 2019 MBP died a couple of weeks ago and I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with it. I took it to Apple who diagnosed a logic board failure and quoted me around £700 to replace even though it's just a few months outside AppleCare warranty... I have an electronics background and equipment (microscope, hot air, soldering iron, oscilloscope etc) but never tried to diagnose a modern MBP before. I have the board view and schematics already and have been climbing the learning curve steadily! [IMG]https://www.badcaps.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif[/IMG]\n\nInitial fault was no power with USB ammeter showing 5.19V @ around 12 to 35ma. I won't go into all the initial debug I did because ultimately I found <RESISTOR>R7900</RESISTOR> to be high resistance when it should have been a 0ohm link. I'm using a genuine 96w Apple charger and cable which works fine on other MacBook Pros. The logic board is fully extracted from the chassis with USB-C sockets attached.\n\nSo, going from the power sequence chart in the schematics I get:\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.29V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_GPU</SIGNAL> = 12.29V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_SSD0_SNS</SIGNAL> = 3.38V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_T</SIGNAL> = 0.02V (this led to <RESISTOR>R7900</RESISTOR> being diagnosed as o/c)\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X</SIGNAL> is also 3.38V which feeds the upstream side of <RESISTOR>R7900</RESISTOR>.\n\nI linked out <RESISTOR>R7900</RESISTOR> with some wire wrap for now and that now causes the USB ammeter to power up and shut down continually and I can't get a reading. I measured <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> with my oscilloscope and the voltage is ramping up from 3.7v to 12.6v over the space of 170ms and then sustaining 12.6v for 70ms before dropping rapidly to 3.7v again.\n\nI tried removing the <RESISTOR>R7900</RESISTOR> bridge and injecting voltage to the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_PMU_VINRTC_R</SIGNAL> line which <RESISTOR>R7900</RESISTOR> feeds and it takes 3.65A at 3.3V. I only ran at this level for a second because the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> Power IC starts to warm up even at 2A current draw at 2.65V injected. When injecting power I didn't see any voltage on the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> outputs.\n\nI checked the T2 power rails as per logi.wiki and got the following. Took resistance measurement plus diode mode in brackets (red lead on ground):\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVDDCPU_AWAKE</SIGNAL> = 15.9ohm (0.021)\n<SIGNAL>PP0V82_SLPDDR</SIGNAL> = 34.5ohm (0.032)\nPPVDDCPUSRAM_AWAKE = 212ohm (0.637)\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> = 7.8kohm (0.402)\n<SIGNAL>PP0V9_SLPDDR</SIGNAL> = 57.3ohm (0.054)\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> = >20kohm (0.390)\n\nGeneral observations - no signs of liquid damage and no corrosion. <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> has a somewhat \"mottled\" appearance under the microscope but no signs of burns. The <SIGNAL>PPGFX_S0_GPU</SIGNAL> line is very low resistance around 1.6ohm but not sure if this is normal. \n\nSo, my guess is that <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> is faulty but I'd appreciate a second opinion. I have a Quick 861DQ hot air station and Hakko FX-888D solder station and have some experience at using hot air but would appreciate nozzle size, airflow and temperature guidance for removing <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>. I would also appreciate any help in finding a source of a new or used/reballed chip. It says it's a 338S00267-A0 (1939PHGU) but I don't know if these are generic or specific to each individual MBP model.\n\nLooks like the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1989</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> chip might be the same. From a quick check of the respective schematics, the BOM details are the same and the pin assignments seem to be the same from what I've checked so far (mostly the LDO section). Even the neighbouring passive components have the same designations and values. I also checked <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2159</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01598</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) but it has a different <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> chip with part number 338S00466 which has different pin assignments, and from checking a BGA stencil from see-ic on eBay, this chip has a different stencil to the 338S00267. The stencils are both 18x18 (324) pins but the pitch on the 466 is very slightly larger than the 267 it seems.\n\nI'd really appreciate any help you can offer.\n\nMany thanks,\nCraig."

This is with my link wire still attached between <RESISTOR>R7900</RESISTOR> pin 1 and 2. Do you want me to do the same readings with the link removed?\n\nThis reading seems okay to me but I don't have a good board to compare against. I wondered if it was an output from the PMU that was shorted but I tried checking all the inductors to ground in diode mode and couldn't find any obvious shorts. When I said the PMU was getting hot, I didn't let it get \"ouch!\" hot but it was certainly warming up once more than 1.5A was flowing into it. \n\nYou mention the PMU's internal firmware - is this coded on the PMU itself or does it come via an external ROM?\n\nI have ordered a BGA reball kit with a clamp, a selection of solder balls and universal stencils which should be here tomorrow. I've also bought an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01041</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board from eBay as a potential donor. The board has already had NAND removed so was quite cheap and appears to still have the PMU installed so I'll give it a try. I can hopefully also salvage <RESISTOR>R7900</RESISTOR> from it to replace it properly and any other passives.\n\nNo worries about the hot air advice, I understand. I'll practice on the donor board before attempting the PMU swap.\nThanks again."

I inspected the solder balls along one edge of <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> and it was clearly not melted so I did a reflow at a higher temperature with more flux added.\n\nIt took a lot of heat and honestly I'm not 100% sure if I did it correctly without damaging the chip but after cooling I tested it again and I get the exact same symptoms I had before I replaced the chip. My ammeter is cycling and never gets to show a voltage or current, and my LDO outputs show no voltage except for LDO3 which briefly pulses up to 160mV or so on the multimeter each time the USB-C ammeter cycles. I still get 12.29V on PPBUS.\n\nAs I mentioned, I used the new PMU chip rather than the one from the donor board but I have extracted the one from the donor board and have manually reballed it with leaded solder balls and could try installing it. But before I do that, I wanted to update you and ask how likely it is to have the exact same symptoms after a PMU replacement? If I installed it badly or overheated the chip during installation, would it show the same symptoms as before?\n\nMany thanks,\nCraig."

I think I was just not prepared for the amount of heat required by lead-free solder, especially on a power chip with presumably large ground planes etc. \n\nIt definitely flowed this time but spat out some solder balls along the bottom edge which I cleaned up. The balls on the top edge now look like they have settled down and flowed and the chip is closer to the PCB surface. But I fear that repeated heating may have destroyed the chip. In particular, prolonged heating at temperatures just not quite hot enough to flow the lead-free solder. I didn't have this problem when I practiced on the donor board by installing the PMU from my good board because it was using leaded solder.\n\nI'll do some diagnosis of <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> to see if I can find out why it is cycling but unless you have any better ideas, I think I should probably remove the PMU again and try installing the one I recovered from the donor board, with leaded solder this time. Failing that I might just have to admit defeat and send the board off to someone in the UK who does board level repairs. Recommendations welcome.\n\nHave a nice weekend."

This line should not be taking any significant current and if you look at the PMU pinout it is surrounded by ground pins on 6 of 8 sides.

Are these too large for the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> PMU or should they be okay? I think my mistake was not using enough heat initially for lead-free solder and then when I started to really ramp up the heat and got a bit desperate to see the chip float, I tapped it from above too hard and caused the solder balls to be ejected from the bottom edge. The shorted pin is 4 rows from the bottom edge so might have got a bridge at the same time.\n\nAre we having fun yet! 😂"

It looks quite similar to the 01700 board I'm repairing but if there is firmware on the chip then you could be right, it might be incompatible. I didn't think there was any firmware on the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> because it's not listed in the \"Programmable Parts\" section in the schematics (page 3) but it makes sense that there is firmware.\n\nI also bought a new chip from see-ic on eBay and it was described as:\n[QUOTE]power Supply  IC Chip  338S00267 reball 338S00267-A0 338S00267-AO BGA IC for repair MacBook PRO A19** Logic Board 338500267 BGA IC for repair for Macbook  pro A17** repair <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01041</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>  MacBook PRO A19** Logic Board Repair[/QUOTE]\n\nNote it mentions the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01041</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> so maybe it's a better bet if I just reball it with leaded solder this time.

As you know, the 01700 board is hard to get at a good price as a donor. But iff anyone can supply a <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> chip from one to me here in the UK, ideally already reballed, then I'd be happy to buy it. Or maybe I just pay a high price for the donor board and then sell it on afterwards.\n\nThanks."

            "message": "Hi, I just wanted to provide a final update and to say that unfortunately I'm going to have to abandon the repair.\n\nI reballed the chip I bought from see-ic which is supposedly compatible with the 01041 board, and this time the reball was good. However, after installing it on the board I went back to the same pulsing PPBUS which I had last time this chip was fitted and a short from L7810 to ground. At that time I postulated that maybe I had a short between the BGA solder balls but this time the soldering went really well with leaded solder so I think maybe the chip itself is faulty. That could have been caused by my original attempt at installing it where I didn't use a high enough temperature to melt the lead-free solder but probably applied the heat for too long.\n\nAs a last ditch attempt, I decided to try to reball the PMU chip I recovered from the 01814 board but the solder mask was starting to break down due to repeated repair attempts and it was just bridging all over the place. There was no way I could apply solder balls again because the balls were just flowing into what should have been masked. I hate to give up on anything but sometimes you just have to call it a day! I've got too many other demands on my time to keep going. \n\nI've learned a lot and I want to thank you for your help and patience. I have no doubt that the fault was with <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> which subsequently blew <RESISTOR>R7900</RESISTOR>, but I took too many attempts to gain the skill required to complete the repair successfully.\n\nPlan B is unfortunately to get Apple to replace the logic board and after that I'll probably sell the machine and buy a MacBook Air instead. I don't really want to continue to be the owner of a 01700 board now that I know how many issues they have!\n\nKind regards,\nCraig."
