        "message":"Define exactly what you originally repaired here, and what the original damage was.\n\nRipple on PP3V42_G3H will be most damaging to the SMC. In machines prior to core i5\/i7, ripple on PP3V42_G3H would be most damaging to MCP clock circuit and the SMC. So my only guess is something SMC related, or corrosion that you missed if this was originally liquid damage.\n\nOur job is not to be psychic, but rather to be detectives. We figure out what is wrong based on original issue, and what the board tells us. There's a story there you need to beat out of the board and convey in your post to get to the root of your problem!"

(under the micrscope.)\n\ntoday i took out the board, to check for waterdamage, after putting it back and pluging in the charger i got nothing. no green light no fan nothing,\n\ni took my multimeter on volts, and measured pp3v42_G3h. at the moment i touch the probe next to u7000 pin 1 probe 422 R7002 i got green light and it booted.\nafter the boot again the screen went black. and back on again and off."

The screen on\/off thing makes me suspect it goes into sleep mode.\nThe no green light issue could very well be that there is corrosion under the SMC. Put some flux under it and heat it up to 150C, don't melt the solder just apply some good heat to clear the crap under it."
