        "message":"Hi, I have this computer which was working fine after I replaced a blown component R7609, it worked fine for a few days (I left it on and working for around 4 days), but when I left it off for 2 days and it doesn\u00b4t turn on again. When I connect the charger to a USB C with the USB C tester it goes directly to 19.63v, las time I was checking around U7650 and PM_SLP_S5_L was low at .280mv. I replaced U7650 and it turned on again, but left it off for a day and now it is the same 19.63v and not turning on... need help on this one to make some sense out of it! I just don\u00b4t understand why when I leave it off for a day it just dies. Thanks for the help!"

When consumption goes to 0 for a couple seconds I get .029 A consumption and the voltage comes down to 5v at .029 A, it makes the transition to 19.6v and around .600 A and shows the apple and starts, but when I try to get into the test user, it is slow as hell!! Any idea over this?\n\nThe voltage sequence that happens can happen 2 times before it starts, is that normal?\nRight now it seems to be stuck at the user loading bar with 19.34v and from .490 to .510 A"

I dont feel like returning it to the customer like this even tough that it came off. Any clues on what to check?\n\nI didn\u00b4t try safe mode, but today it loaded fine, nor the USB Macos boot.\n\nupdate: I put it to sleep by closing the lid and this morning, when I connected it to usb c, it was 19.6v and .029A, pressed the ON button and the fans whent to full speed inmediatly (consumption is still the same .029A and the battery is connected), it is turning on, but I don\u00b4t think is ready to get back to the owner, any help on this on what to check?\n\nI disconnected the battery, and connected the usb c and it is only getting 5v and 0A it is not making the transition to 19v"
