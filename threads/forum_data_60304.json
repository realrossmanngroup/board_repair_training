The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

When I connect the charger to a USB C with the USB C tester it goes directly to 19.63v, las time I was checking around <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> was low at .280mv. I replaced <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> and it turned on again, but left it off for a day and now it is the same 19.63v and not turning on... need help on this one to make some sense out of it! I just don´t understand why when I leave it off for a day it just dies. Thanks for the help!"

When consumption goes to 0 for a couple seconds I get .029 A consumption and the voltage comes down to 5v at .029 A, it makes the transition to 19.6v and around .600 A and shows the apple and starts, but when I try to get into the test user, it is slow as hell!! Any idea over this?\n\nThe voltage sequence that happens can happen 2 times before it starts, is that normal?\nRight now it seems to be stuck at the user loading bar with 19.34v and from .490 to .510 A"
