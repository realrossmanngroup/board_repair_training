            "message": "I don't even know where to start at this moment anymore, I've been working on this device most of my day and It just doesn't want to work.\n\n[B]Story:[/B]\nCustomer handed me his macbook. Told me he got the motherboard replaced at company *X* for $700 a year ago, but now it keeps rebooting, is unstable or doesn't want to power up at times. He checked and said there was lots of corrosion but company *X* told him it was his fault and not theirs.\n\nAfter opening up the macbook and inspecting the motherboard it looked like absolutely trash underneath the microscope. Flux everywhere and it just looks like all the parts were resolderd atleast once. On every single part of the board where the pads would usually be nostuff there is solder now, indicating someone went past it with his iron.\nThey also used this annoying thick flux which is just surrounding most of the chips, its not solid but its definitely hard to remove at room temperature, it also makes it hard for me to probe points.\nAfter some good inspection the most screwed up part was around the SMC, quite the bit of corrosion. I cleaned most of the corrosion up with 99.9% 2-Propanol and checked but it didn't solve the issues (When will it ever be simple? haha), the system was still acting rather oddly and most of the time wouldn't even power on..\nI expected corrosion underneath the SMC, since its the logical explanation why power management is acting weird. I de-soldered the SMC and placed on a new one. Well this is where the bigger issues started, now the system always powers on.. But there is no Chime and No display.\n\nOften the system stays on for about 8 seconds before it shuts down completely, if you quickly reconnect the charger it will power on again and stay on (But still no Chime and display).\n\nVCore is 1.15V and the CPU gets warm, if I power it on without any ram modules installed the system would start beeping, indicating an issue with ram.\n\nI then replaced the SMC chip with another new one (You never really know what kind of crap china sends you), however the issue stayed exactly the same.\n\nI also checked the data going in to the SPI Chip (<CHIP>U6100</CHIP>), the CLK is there and it seems like data is both going IN&OUT. The clock and data looks pretty odd compared to a working <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, in the start there is about 1-2 seconds of 0.5 second long high/low pulses before actual data is being sent. Also sometimes these long pulses happen while also data is going over it.\nIt might not be relatable to this issue, though.\n\n[B]Short Version:[/B]\n\nMacbook had issues with booting at times, very unstable. Corrosion on the board and just a lot of flux everywhere from someone else. Cleaned corrosion and decided to replace SMC chip due lots of corrosion around that area. After new SMC the light on the charger shows, the fan spins but there is no Chime and no Display or backlight. Replaced with another SMC chip (from the same batch), same issues.\nCPU VCore is 1.15V, CPU gets warm and when booted up without RAM memory it will beep.\nSystem often shuts down after about 8 seconds, but when booted up for the second time in a very short period it will stay on.\nChecked <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> (SPI Chip's clock and data, looked a bit off compared to a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. I however don't have another <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> to compare.\n\nAll major power lines are up as far as I checked\n\nI got a digital oscilloscope, its not state of the art technology but good enough to see clocks and data over non-high speed chips. If you want me to check some part with the oscilloscope I can post screenshots of its output.\n\n[B]Questions:[/B]\n\n- Where to look? What could be causing this issue?\n- Might the second SMC also be bad? Is it worth a fair try to replace it a 3rd time but with a totally different seller's stock?\n- Is it possible I toasted the chipset (<CHIP>U1800</CHIP>) while soldering the SMC back on? (I doubt it, I didn't use /insane/ temperatures. I can't exclude it either though..)\n\nThanks in advance, let me know if there are any questions."

I had the assumption the chime would sound from both speakers, however it only does from the speaker next to the wireless module. My bad\n(And since it posts the USB mouse indeed did light up)\n\nIt runs unbearably slow though. I ran AHT and it came back with (4SNS/1/40000000: VD0R-19.314)\n\nWhich if I'm correctly indicates a sensor issue (4SNS), with the DC voltage sensor. I think the 19.314 number might be a voltage, but even without the charger plugged in this number stays above 19V so its not likely <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>. When it runs off the battery its slightly lower though (3 tests, ~19.01-19.19 on battery, 2 tests >19.3 on charger). Maybe its noting like a voltage though and I'm just speculating too much\n\nSince the SMC (If I recall correctly) processes the sensor information, is it still perfectly possible I didn't solder the SMC back on properly or the replacement SMC is damaged?\n\nThanks again for the support"
