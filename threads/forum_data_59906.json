This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

It looks like it’s been tossed around parts are knocked off and <CHIP>U2940</CHIP> is cracked. I don’t have this size caps or a donor board yet i need to order one is the TPS22920YZPR from digikey compatible ? Also Same question for <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> from digikey\n\nAt L7095 Before removing cap\n5 ohm\nDiode mode\n.06v\n\nafter removing\n\n47k Ohms\ndiode mode .313v\n\nCan I power it on without this cap ? Is it critical?"
