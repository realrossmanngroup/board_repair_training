There is obviously no image, no CPU activity, just the fan spin for 3-4 seconds at the beginning. After a close inspection, I can tell there is no presence of liquid and it seems there is no apparent damage on component.\n\nMain S5, S4 and S0 rails are present. \nHowever PPVCCCPU_S0G is missing (6omhs to ground, same as a good working board). U7210 and U7220 are well supplied by PPBUS_G3H and PP5V_S0, CPUVR_PWM are presents (2.5V), but CPUVR_FCCM are not. I don't know what FCCM means, but on the U7100 where it comes from, schematics says it's critical. So maybe a problem with U7100. \n\nU7100 looks brand new, well supplied by PP5V_S0 and PPBUS_G3H. Also, PM_EN_CPUVCC_R = 3,2V. I have no clue how this U7100 works and what to mesure...\n\nI also have noticed some SMC rails are missing. Here is what I mesured for main SMC rails :\n- SMC_LRESET_L = 0V ---> PLT_RST_L = 0V too\n- SMC_ONOFF_L = 3.3V\n- PM_SYSRST_L = 3.3V\n- SMC_RST_BTN_L = 0V\n\nI have tried to clean the ME Region with Medusa, no change.\nThank you to everyone who will take time to read this thread, and help me to sort this out ! Bye ;)"}
