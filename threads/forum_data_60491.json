            "message": "Hi Rossmann's repair group crew,\n\nHere is the behavior of the board : when I plug the charger, it ramp to 20V 150mA, stay there for 10 sec, then 20V 0A for a few seconds, and finally goes back to 20V 150mA and stay there. There is obviously no image, no CPU activity, just the fan spin for 3-4 seconds at the beginning. After a close inspection, I can tell there is no presence of liquid and it seems there is no apparent damage on component.\n\nMain S5, S4 and S0 rails are present. \nHowever <SIGNAL>PPVCCCPU_S0G</SIGNAL> is missing (6omhs to ground, same as a good working board). <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7220</CHIP> are well supplied by <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>CPUVR_PWM</SIGNAL> are presents (2.5V), but <SIGNAL>CPUVR_FCCM</SIGNAL> are not. I don't know what FCCM means, but on the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> where it comes from, schematics says it's critical. So maybe a problem with <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>. \n\n<CHIP>U7100</CHIP> looks brand new, well supplied by <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. Also, <SIGNAL>PM_EN_CPUVCC_R</SIGNAL> = 3,2V. I have no clue how this <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> works and what to mesure...\n\nI also have noticed some SMC rails are missing. Here is what I mesured for main SMC rails :\n- <SIGNAL>SMC_LRESET_L</SIGNAL> = 0V ---> <SIGNAL>PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL> = 0V too\n- <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n- <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n- <SIGNAL>SMC_RST_BTN_L</SIGNAL> = 0V\n\nI have tried to clean the ME Region with Medusa, no change.\nThank you to everyone who will take time to read this thread, and help me to sort this out ! Bye ;)"
