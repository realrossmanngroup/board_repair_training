            "message": "Originally came in with liquid damage and a damaged trackpad connector and cable. I replaced the cable and trackpad connector and repaired a trace for the keyboard on pin 6 and that worked fine. It was sent back working, customer (who is another shop) was responsible for putting it completely back together, sent it back a week later saying it didn't work. There were more traces broken this time on the connector. Traces for pins 1,3,5,7,9 were broken so I repaired those but still no trackpad or keyboard. Unable to verify whether either work in recovery mode due to the customer breaking the power button so I'm waiting for a replacement to test that. Here are the voltages I took. \n\n1 - 1.8v\n2 - 1.8v\n3 - 1.8v\n4 - 1.8v\n5 - 0v\n7 - 1.8v\n9 - 0v\n11 - 0v\n12 - 3.3v\n13 - 0v\n14 - 1.8v\n15 - 5v\n17 - GND\n19 - 1.8v\n21 - 1.8v\n23 - GND\n\nIPD_SPI_EN - 0V\n\nThese voltages are with the trackpad connected.\nTried with another trackpad and cable. Also verified the traces from the connector to the components are good. \n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks."
