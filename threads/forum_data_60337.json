            "message": "hello guys, have got n <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that would not power on charger but works 100% on battery . I do not seem to fully understand the 2018 model of operation , I measure 12.30V on PPBUS with charger only connected and 5V in PPDCIN, I have checked for a short to ground but no short, the only thing I could notice is 0V at <SIGNAL>CHGR_RST_IN</SIGNAL>, I don't know if that's suppose to be high like <SIGNAL>CHGR_RST_L</SIGNAL> signal . I believe when any of the CD3215s are faulty , the machine wouldn't power with the battery either, please correct me on this , as I could be wrong"
