        "message":"This 820-3437 powers on when charger is plug , works normally no problems etc , just 1 detail power button don't work  , and sometimes after power off becomes dead , and don't want to power on , unless board is take out battery remove , and all plug back in , then when charger is plug works again normally battery holds charge , this board was test on diferent bodys , and keyboards , the only odd thing I find was SMC_ONOFF_L is 2.1v\n\nplz how I can start to trouble shoot this?"

        "message":"I have absolutely no idea what \"6 of temp\" would be in reality. Usually you'd put the air on something reasonably low so the flow doesn't come flying of the board the moment you get the hot air station near it.\n\"6 of temp\" does that usually make the lead free solder melt?\n\nUsually if I really want to thoroughly reflow a SMC I heat it up like I would do with any kind of chip and slightly tap it from the side (not from above as this will ruin the balls possibly) which should make it move and then align again due the flux guiding the chip. I do this on all sides I can reach very softly so the SMC has moved to all the sides a little bit. This also helps the solder to attach to pads that might look less then pristine. Don't tap it hard, you don't want it to get off its pad and attach to the ones next to it. Also keep in mind that this is a pretty aggressive reflow which I only recommend doing when your other last hope would be completely replacing the SMC.\n\nI can also recommend you getting the feel for reflowing SMC's with a dead board first though, I messed up times before I got 'alright' at it.\n\nDo not just replace U5110 and C4834, remove them first and see if the resistance to ground gets above 1kohm before putting them back on"
