            "message": "Hi people !\n\nI have a very clean board there, no liquid damage, that doesn't turn on. It seems it overheated around T2 Chip, on the back of it some resistors are kind of brownish (maybe it's just baked dust, IDK). I tried to restore T2 Chip but it is not enable to complete the process, always end with an error (tried with different host Mac, different OS, and official Apple cables).\n\nI made some mesurements :\n[LIST]\n[*]PPBUS : 12.7V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> : 5.1V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> : 3.4V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> : 1.8V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3</SIGNAL> : 0V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PP0V6_S0_DDRVTT</SIGNAL> : 0V\n[/LIST]\nAfter that I guessed the RAM was not supplied, so I check around his buck controller <CHIP>U8100</CHIP>. It is well supplied by 5V, but nothing comes out because it's not telling to (0V on pin 16 and 17). As these signals comes from the PMIC, I think it is the culprit, but I am not used to work on these models at the moment, so not really sure.\n\nI'd like to know if I missed something and if there is some steps to check before I remove the PMIC and try to replace it.\n\nThank you for your time, Bye"
