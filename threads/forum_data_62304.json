I could only find some videos taking about <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> which apparently is not the same. I peeled off protective varnish from the cable to expose the traces and ran jumpers from them., but the video I found on YouTube shows 9 traces, I have 10 here and don't know exactly where to solder them on the other side. Anyone have a wiring diagram for this?"
