(not like the mux kind color distortion,but like the whole image got twisted or something)\none specific board has no output on the display port, not sure if it's related.\n\nthinking problem should be laying around the video circuit, I actually replaced the GPUs previously but that didn't solve the issue, so thinking on the GPU power circuit now.\ncan't find any capacitor similar to <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>... so really no clues, anyone solved this problem yet?I think it's pretty common, I came across about 5-6 boards these few months of this problem already( this specific model)\n\nthanks"
