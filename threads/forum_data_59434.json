        "message":"Got a 27inch Imac in today which has no power. Customer says it was working fine until it was knocked off the table (screen is broken also but that's a separate issue)\n\nI've opened it up and appear to have 12V coming out of the PSU to the motherboard and LED1 for standby power is on. When I press the power button nothing happens at all  - i've checked the power button for continuity when it's pressed and it appears to be working. \n\nI'm leaning towards maybe a PSU fault but I don't see many of these issues so would appreciate any guidance as to where I should check first as I would have to order a new PSU!"
