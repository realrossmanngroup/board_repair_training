Found that <CAPACITOR>C6913</CAPACITOR> was getting molten hot so replaced it and now the machine gets to 20v and comes on, but it only gets to a \"charge battery\" screen for a few seconds and then shuts off. This happens with both battery + charger as well as charger alone. What should I be checking next in this case? Replaced <DIODE>D6902</DIODE> on a whim as well."
