A Macbook Pro A1990 (820-01814) from 2018. It has no image \u2013 or backlight for that matter.\n\nNo history of liquid spills or anything. It's fully functional on external monitor - and the webcam works.. But it doesn't seem like the internal display is even detected in the settings.\n\nThe backlight has been lighting up a few times when entering recovery-mode.\n\nI tested the panel on another Macbook, and the display worked perfectly. So, I know it\u2019s well and working.\n\nI get 0 volts on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT. Tried diode-mode on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT and got a reading of about 1950. I\u2019m not I entirely sure what that tells me.\n\nI really can\u2019t figure out what the problem is. Can\u2019t seem to find any defect components or anything.\n\nAll the best\n\n-R"}
