A Macbook Pro <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1990</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01814</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) from 2018. It has no image – or backlight for that matter.\n\nNo history of liquid spills or anything. It's fully functional on external monitor - and the webcam works.. But it doesn't seem like the internal display is even detected in the settings.\n\nThe backlight has been lighting up a few times when entering recovery-mode.\n\nI tested the panel on another Macbook, and the display worked perfectly. So, I know it’s well and working.\n\nI get 0 volts on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>. Tried diode-mode on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> and got a reading of about 1950. I’m not I entirely sure what that tells me.\n\nI really can’t figure out what the problem is. Can’t seem to find any defect components or anything.\n\nAll the best\n\n-R"
