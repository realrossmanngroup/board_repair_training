        "message":"Hello all,\nso I have an 820-3332 that had it's screen break off. The client still used it for a few months untill it started to cut in and out (no hinges to support it). I recieved a replacement lvds cable but still no image. Checked on our ol friend and Mr. Shoe rubber was installed... So he got new solder and looks great now, but still no image.\n\nWhat would be the next course of action, what would a shorted lvds line potentially do?\n\nUnfortunately, I do not have a test screen to see if this one was damaged from not being structurally connected for so long."
