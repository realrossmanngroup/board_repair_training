Trackpad & keyboard definitely worked.\n\nI found corrosion all around <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>, which was badly damaged at Pin 5 (<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB</SIGNAL>). I replaced the driver which fixed the backlight, but now the trackpad/kb are completely inop. I have checked for damage to the cable and the connector. The rest of the board looks clean as well, like a single drop of water went straight to the backlight driver and killed it."

Do trackpad & keyboard work here in this screen? Can you hit left & right to select other boot devices and move the cursor around and click them? If so, I leave this for duke. :D\n\nI'm also assuming you already tried another flat cable/trackpad/keyboard at this point that are known good."

Tested arrows, wifi login, etc\n\nI have not tested another cable, trackpad, or kb due to lack of testable parts. Seems these are probably OK though since they work in the Option boot menu?\n\nEDIT:\n\nOK since measuring the kb connector pins and letting it sit in the option menu to think about its life for a few minutes, I rebooted it normally and everything works. Mark this one solved i guess? This one [I]definitely [/I]won't come back. Nope. Not a chance."
