CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",
        "CHGR_AMON": "What is CHGR_AMON? CHGR_AMON provides DC current sense information to the SMC(System management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip). It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",

This one is dead.\nSo I replaced it with another one now it's charging normally.\n\nAgain thanks for your support and patience\n\nYou can set this Topic as Solved. but i you could just answser to the question regarding the battery logos......thanks\n\nBest Regards"
