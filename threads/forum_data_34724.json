Other than that nothing looked damaged and the board is very clean. It has Magsafe light, 3V42, ACOK. I replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> twice. No change either time. I replaced all 4 sense resistors and <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR>. All traces are good in those circuits. All components around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> are good. All pins on <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> are measuring normal voltage-drop to ground. If I plug in a battery and then plug in the adapter it will stay turn on. But without the battery, it stays at 1.4V. This isn't adding up for me. Any idea what I'm missing?"
