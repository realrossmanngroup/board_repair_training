        "message":"Hi, I have a 820-01700 with corrosion on U5620 and C9580\/C9581. Additionally, there is a burn mark between RX2- and VBUS on the USB-C connector with a diode reading of 0.127 between the pins when the power jack board is disconnected.\n\nThe board draws 5.18V @ 46mA with PPBUS_G3H at 0V and a diode reading of 0.001 to ground.\n\nWe have quite long shipping times where I come from so, I would like to debug as much as possible and then order all likely defective parts. Are there any components that usually fail together with U5620. Anything I can test regarding the short on the USB-C connector?"
