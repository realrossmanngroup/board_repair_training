Additionally, there is a burn mark between RX2- and VBUS on the USB-C connector with a diode reading of 0.127 between the pins when the power jack board is disconnected.\n\nThe board draws 5.18V @ 46mA with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> at 0V and a diode reading of 0.001 to ground.\n\nWe have quite long shipping times where I come from so, I would like to debug as much as possible and then order all likely defective parts. Are there any components that usually fail together with <CHIP>U5620</CHIP>. Anything I can test regarding the short on the USB-C connector?"
