Liquid damage ? its very uncommon to have that on the 2015 15 inch :: Tha MacBook Air you did a reflow I suppose was a 2011, which was most likely the PCH  and the reason why it came back .. Please confirm you have 1.5V Supply for the RAM \n\n[IMG]https:\/\/boards.rossmanngroup.com\/core\/blob:https:\/\/boards.rossmanngroup.com\/54160494-053a-494f-92b2-7640ffd67b79[\/IMG]"}

If voltage is present, reflow RAM and pray. If RAM doesn't fix it, bad CPU, bad internal trace etc and waste of time."}
