I've been probing all around the CPU's supplies and the CPU itself and nothing seems to be very out of order.\nThe motherboard does have close to no signs of any water damage, the customer confirmed it has not been in contact with liquid. Other then it being a bit dusty it looks good.\nQuick ADT came back without issues\n\nBehaviour:\n\n- Macbook always starts with the chime (It does always POST)\n- Usually after letting it cool down it boots into the system and is usable for 5-30 minutes until it crashes\n- Once it crashes, directly rebooting it will most likely let it crash in just a few minutes (Possible issue due heat?)\n- It doesn't always kernel_panic, usually the cursor\/system just locks up showing no sign of life. I've also had it happen that the screen just went black while browsing and it started blasting the fan on full speed even though the CPU wasn't warm.\n\nWhere to even start looking with something like this? Any help is much appreciated :)"}
