UB300 and UB400 were replaced and there was still dried flux around them and UB300 was replaced with a CD3215B chip instead of a C00 version. I was getting 5v cycling on 2 ports, nothing on the port for UB300, and surprisingly I was getting 20v 1.5a from the port that corresponds to <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>. When it does take 20v, the fans start spinning on high immediately and the board does not seem to post. No USB activity or caps lock reaction. I found shorts on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_TA_LDO</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4_T_USBC</SIGNAL>, and <SIGNAL>UPC_T_5V_EN</SIGNAL>. I removed both UB300 and UB400 and all those shorts were gone. Before replacing UB300 and 400, I connected the charger to <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> again and it was still giving me 20v even with 2 <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s missing from the board, which I thought was impossible. I have since replaced UB300 and 400 with new chips but its still the same. Most of the time <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> will still give me 20v and the other 3 ports will only go to 5v and then cycle on off. Sometimes I will get 5v steady on all 4 ports now also. Do you think I should try and replace <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> or could this be a SMC issue?"
