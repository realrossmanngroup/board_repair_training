    "definitions": {
        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PP5V_SUS": "What is PP5V_SUS? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PM_DSW_PWRGD": "What is PM_DSW_PWRGD? The \"PM_DSW_PWRGD\" signal in a MacBook stands for \"Deep Sleep Well Power Good” and is required for the machine to power on & post..",
        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",
        "PCH_INTRUDER_L": "What is PCH_INTRUDER_L? PCH_INTRUDER_L is a signal that tells the machine the case has been opened by an intruder when it is low, the _L means it is present when it is low. This signal should always be high in a Macbook since it doesn’t use intrusion detection. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",
        "PCH_INTVRMEN": "What is PCH_INTVRMEN? PCH_INTVRMEN is an Internal Voltage Regulator Enable: When pulled high, this signal enables\nthe internal 1.05 V regulators for the Suspend well in the PCH. This signal must\nremain asserted for the VRMs to behave properly (no glitches allowed).\nThis signal must be pulled-up to VCCRTC on desktop platforms and may\noptionally be pulled low on mobile platforms if using an external VR for the\nVCCSUS rail.",
        "R1802": "What is R1802? a RESISTOR.",
        "C1802": "What is C1802? Capacitor to ground on PCH_SRTCRST_L on machines from 2009-2012, PCH_SRTCRST_L needs to be high for PCH to not be in RTC reset mode, this capacitor can become corroded or leaky and result in this signal being pulled low. ."
