        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",

            "message": "Hello all! I have yet another MacBook that is sad.  ?  It is an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> that does not have a backlight (and possibly no image) going to the display. The laptop was brought to me because water was split on the laptop.\n\n[LIST]\n[*]The first thing I checked was to see if the MacBook would take 20V and it does reach 20V through both chargers. It typically takes about 500mA at first then settles between 150-300mA.\n[*]After opening, immediately noticeable was some corrosion near a few PPBUS _G3H caps, the area near <CHIP>U3890</CHIP>, and a couple other places. However, I did not find any shorts near those areas.\n[*]I checked for warm spots on the board and I noticed the area near the display connector was getting hot. I thought this was just the CPU at first, but the heat seemed too focused. I then removed the display flex cable and saw more corrosion near J8500. The worst of it was near the 5V camera line (<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_ALSCAM</SIGNAL>). L4010 was burnt and the line was reading somewhere between 0.3V-0.5V. I replaced. the burnt filter and <CAPACITOR>C4013</CAPACITOR> for good measure. This resolved the short on that line and 5V was returned to that line.\n[*]I checked the resistance on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> and I recall it being lower than expected (somewhere around 500-2K ohms). I removed J8500 along with a couple of capacitors near the connected. The connector looked corroded/carbonized near <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_ALSCAM</SIGNAL> &<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> so it needed replaced anyway. Once this was done and the pins were cleaned up with fresh solder, the resistance on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> was restored to about 0.5MΩ.\n[/LIST]\nThe computer does turn on and boot to an external USB drive. I saw the activity light and I was able to remote into my copy of macOS while booted to this laptop. I also checked the continuity between the end of the display flex cable and some of the lines on the logic board to check the connections. All of the ones I tested seemed to work just fine. There is no corrosion near the area of <CHIP>U8400</CHIP>. I guess I'm just a little stuck on what to check next as everything else seems to be working.  ?‍♂️\n\nVoltage Table:\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]13.05V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]5.10V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0.01V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0.08V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>BKLT_EN_R</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0.0V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_F</SIGNAL> @ F8400[/TD]\n[TD]13.04V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_R</SIGNAL> @ <TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR>[/TD]\n[TD]13.05V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL> @ <TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR>[/TD]\n[TD]12.93V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> @ <TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR>[/TD]\n[TD]0.10V (Resistance: 0.45 MΩ)[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_BKLT</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]5.10V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nThanks in advance for reading this! ?"
