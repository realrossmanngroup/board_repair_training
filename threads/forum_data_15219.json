We actually did not detect any corrosion on the mobo but just in case we put it in ultrasonic machine and dry it.\nAfter first boot, OS is running very slow. \nASD test shows all pass. All sensors show normal reading.\nDisconnected everything unnecessary from the board to eliminate possible component problems.\nStuck. Please advice how to proceed.\n\nThanks."
