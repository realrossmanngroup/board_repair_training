        "message":"hi friends.\n\nthis mainboard is running good but sometimes the fan is spinning full speed.\n\nin asd no errors.\n\nsometimes, in asd, or in osx the fan beginns to running very fast. took a look at the temperatures cpu temps are over 100C.\nat first i thought a defect in the sensors but touched the mainboard its realy very hot under the cpu.\n\ni tryed new thermal paste and another heatpipe already but nothing.\n\nsometimes its cooling down to 66-70C, sometimes it runs a time without problems\n\nanother time it starts to going hot after minutes.\n\nany idea where to look what problem that could be?"
