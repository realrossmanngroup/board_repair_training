Logic board sometimes doesn't turn on (only first led turns on the board) when that happens, I have to unplug power cable for fa while and then iMac start to work normally.\nWhen imac turns on, it works perfectly, I have already tried with other working power supply on both.\nCould be an SMC problem?"

It could be a power rail or smc issue. \nHonestly this forum is becoming useless, most of the answer I read in all topic are useless, superficial and obvious. Only Louis' answer are always useful, but he reply rarely, maybe he hasn't enough time. Why Why Louis doe not make a video of iMac board?"
