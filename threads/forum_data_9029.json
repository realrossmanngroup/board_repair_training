Seconds away from giving up and this post is my last resort. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is not holding and is always changing values. From around 8v to 12.6v. \nF7040 is fine and I even changed <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> off a working board. Same result. \n<RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> are those sense resistors. I don't quite understand how they work although the readings seem fine. Can't find any shorts.\nPossible for some nudges in the right direction??\nThaks again."

This board doesn't work either. Has no green orange light. \n\nTook 3 weeks to arrive and really don't have time to send it back and wait so I thought I'd diagnose. Found <SIGNAL>CHGR_CSI_R_N</SIGNAL> between <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR> missing. Jumped it. Got a green light and laptop powers up and all works bar an x for the battery. \n\nSo the smc is not seeing the battery I'm guessing.. And pins 4 and 6 on the battery connector are the lines that tell the smc there is a battery?? Am I on the track?\n\n<CHIP>U4900</CHIP> creates <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL</SIGNAL> and goes to battery then to <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>\n\ni cant find any other tracks not present. Is this a dead <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>? Proper brain stuck now."
