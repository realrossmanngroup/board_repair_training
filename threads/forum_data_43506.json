    "definitions": {
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the backlight on the LCD screen, this is necessary to get the screen to light up..",
        "R7704": "What is R7704? a RESISTOR.",
        "C7704": "What is C7704? a CAPACITOR.",
        "LCDBKLT_BOOST": "What is LCDBKLT_BOOST? LCDBKLT_BOOST is connected to the SWITCH(SW) pin of the LED driver and is switched to ground quickly after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit that boosts PPBUS_G3H to backlight voltage for the screen. .",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "EDP_BKLT_PWM": "What is EDP_BKLT_PWM? EDP_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

Thanks Louis !\n\nHere, I'm coming with a Macbook Air 2013 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> A with no water damage (really, I never seen a computer as clean) !\n\nI take some measures with my (very very bad) multimeter around <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> : <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> was about 0.06V so I shorted to <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> and is now 3.3V.\n\n\n[IMG]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/filedata/fetch?filedataid=2109&type=thumb[/IMG]\n\nAll measures are shown. <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> looks a little bit low but I think it's my multimeter because I won't measure 8.46V as <SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> but boost won't work, I agree.\n\nI can't probe feedback track without removing <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> because I don't find any via... (They don't exist on my pcb version ?) Ho may I do ?\n\n<DIODE>D7701</DIODE> isn't shorted.\n\nPRAM reset is done.\n\nWhat I'm wrong ?\n\nSorry for my English, I'm a little Belgian guy !\n\nRegards,\n\nCol\n\nBonus : the ugly short\n\n[IMG]https://scontent.fbru1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/48366529_2331679290399558_4218892713539403776_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&_nc_ht=scontent.fbru1-1.fna&oh=c4a86bada68aa28324086d492a0ae787&oe=5C9CDA66[/IMG]"
