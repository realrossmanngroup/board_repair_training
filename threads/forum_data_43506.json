        "message":"Hello guys,\n\nFirst thanks for all videos, it's fabulous to give a second chance to a lot of Apple products. Thanks Louis !\n\nHere, I'm coming with a Macbook Air 2013 A1466 820-3437 A with no water damage (really, I never seen a computer as clean) !\n\nI take some measures with my (very very bad) multimeter around LP8550 : BKL_PWM was about 0.06V so I shorted to PP3V3_S0 and is now 3.3V.\n\n\n[IMG]https:\/\/www.rossmanngroup.com\/boards\/filedata\/fetch?filedataid=2109&type=thumb[\/IMG]\n\nAll measures are shown. BKL_EN looks a little bit low but I think it's my multimeter because I won't measure 8.46V as PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT but boost won't work, I agree.\n\nI can't probe feedback track without removing LP8550 because I don't find any via... (They don't exist on my pcb version ?) Ho may I do ?\n\nD7701 isn't shorted.\n\nPRAM reset is done.\n\nWhat I'm wrong ?\n\nSorry for my English, I'm a little Belgian guy !\n\nRegards,\n\nCol\n\nBonus : the ugly short\n\n[IMG]https:\/\/scontent.fbru1-1.fna.fbcdn.net\/v\/t1.15752-9\/48366529_2331679290399558_4218892713539403776_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&_nc_ht=scontent.fbru1-1.fna&oh=c4a86bada68aa28324086d492a0ae787&oe=5C9CDA66[\/IMG]"
