            "message": "I have this equipment that I have reviewed everything and I do not have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> that is not shorted and comes from the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>, but I have a doubt if the equipment is in dfu, does the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> not generate that voltage? I say this because if the voltage in <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.6v it would be in dfu. it has something to do with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> having 12v, 12.3v or 12.6v. When connecting the by-3200 device with a voltage of 20v and 2 amps, it gives me a source consumption of 0.092 and it stays there. Thank you"
