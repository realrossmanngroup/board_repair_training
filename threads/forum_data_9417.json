            "message": "Hi.\n\nI got this one in with a good amount of coffee inside. I UC it but it did still not turn on. \n\nFound a short in the <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> (PHASE 2 / CPU VR12.5 VCC Power Stage). I removed the chip and computer now boots without it. Battery does not charge but it is because of the battery itself is damaged. Charging a new battery works fine.\n\nMy question is how important is this one chip? Because it has some thin almost invisible horizontal lines on the screen and the computer is with integrated graphics so I am unsure if these thin lines is due to this chip or the screen itself is also damaged. I dont have a 2015 display for testing this at hand and I am unsure if the customer wants to pay for repair if the screen also needs replacement. So before finding a replacement <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> chip or a replacement display I would like to know if the display symptoms could be caused by this or not. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is 1.78V\n\nThanks"
