I believe it could become corrupted after a failed upgrade or something.\nSymptoms are we can't do a PRAM reset nor access the EFI boot menu.\nScreen stays black though we have backlight.\n\nCan someone share a Clean dump of a 820-3462 bios please?"}

I will try your Bios anyway just to confirm.\n\nIs there a list of banned EDID screen codes somewhere to compare please?"}
