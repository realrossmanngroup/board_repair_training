            "message": "Hello,\nthis <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> was waterdamaged. I fixed all the corrosion and now it works again. The only problem is that its working slow and fan is spinning full speed. I run ASD and got 1 error: TC0C \"unable to read sensor\". I Already changed <CHIP>U5510</CHIP>, <CAPACITOR>C5511</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C5512</CAPACITOR> and verifyed <RESISTOR>R5510</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R5511</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5512</RESISTOR>. I also measured every Pin of <CHIP>U5510</CHIP>:\n\nPin 1: 5 V\nPin 2: 1.1 V\nPin 3: 0.56 V\nPin 4: 1.03 V\nPin 5: 0.6 V\nPin 6: 0 V\nPin 7: 5 V\nPin 8: 5 V\nPin 9: 3.3 V\nPin 10: 3.3 V\n\nThat seems fine to me so far. Also the vias connecting <CAPACITOR>C5511</CAPACITOR> to the other side of the board look fine and a broken trace would lead to a \"to high\" or \"to low\" reading if i am right.\nSo i dont really know what to do at this ponit. I am kinda expecting it to be the CPU (as other sonsor readings this chip provides can be read by the SMC) but hoping that there is anything else i have missed..."
