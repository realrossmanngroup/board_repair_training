I fixed all the corrosion and now it works again. The only problem is that its working slow and fan is spinning full speed. I run ASD and got 1 error: TC0C \"unable to read sensor\". I Already changed U5510, C5511, C5512 and verifyed R5510, R5511 and R5512. I also measured every Pin of U5510:\n\nPin 1: 5 V\nPin 2: 1.1 V\nPin 3: 0.56 V\nPin 4: 1.03 V\nPin 5: 0.6 V\nPin 6: 0 V\nPin 7: 5 V\nPin 8: 5 V\nPin 9: 3.3 V\nPin 10: 3.3 V\n\nThat seems fine to me so far. Also the vias connecting C5511 to the other side of the board look fine and a broken trace would lead to a \"to high\" or \"to low\" reading if i am right.\nSo i dont really know what to do at this ponit. I am kinda expecting it to be the CPU (as other sonsor readings this chip provides can be read by the SMC) but hoping that there is anything else i have missed..."}

R4910 was bad. I was hoping for exactly something like that that i missed. \nSo thank you anyways for the support and the possibilitys that this forum offers."}
