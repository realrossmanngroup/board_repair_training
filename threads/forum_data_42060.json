        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U5750": "What is U5750? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "SMC_TPAD_RST_L": "What is SMC_TPAD_RST_L? SMC_TPAD_RST_L is a signal that comes from the trackpad that can reset the SMC when it is low.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. The trackpad having corrosion from liquid damage is a very common cause of no light on the magsafe charger & the system not turning on, when the trackpad or trackpad cable is corroded and holding this line down. .",
        "U5701": "What is U5701? this is the keyboard controller chip that takes the keyboard and trackpad input and turns it into a USB device signal for the machine to process. If replacing a keyboard doesn’t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. ."
