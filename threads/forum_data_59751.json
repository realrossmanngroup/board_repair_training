Any suggestions?\n\n\nSomething I have never come across before. One of the CD3215C chips I have replaced has different ID under the printed part. Have anyone seems anything like this?\nCannot make up the ID, but seems like TPS series used for usb-c controllers on laptops.\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59343[\/ATTACH]"}
