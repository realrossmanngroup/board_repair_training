        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "U8510": "What is U8510? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

( no short )..\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> 2.8v\n<SIGNAL>BUF_SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> 2.2v , removing <CHIP>U8510</CHIP> make both of that voltage 3.3v.. does all this symptom pointing to bad smc ? ( I have tried replacing <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> )"
