        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
