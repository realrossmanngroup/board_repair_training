Remember there is a lot on the system side such as PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS and all the derivates of PPBUS. It could be any of the big caps, little caps, backlight fuse area, thunderbolt, etc. The one thing you don't want to be shorting it to ground is Q7310 because if it's shorted, then RIP."}

Crank up the voltage until you have 2-4 Amp current draw and then something must heat up. It could be the CPU so remove the heat sink and check that too."}

The reason you start low is to avoid sparking the CPU if it's dead. Don't put the fuse on until you find the short. Check all of the big caps for holes in the sides of them or any smoking."}
