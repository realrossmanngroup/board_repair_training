Put back original chip, those Ebay ones are probably a dump from another board and will give ME region problems.\nConnect a USB mouse and see if it lights up."}

I put back the original chip and it does the same thing. It seems like the ebay chip has done something to the logicboard. The chime was present when i had the original efi chip in there once I put the ebay efi chip it displayed the no chime black screen issue. The mouse lights on then turns off every 10 seconds."}
