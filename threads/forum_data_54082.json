            "message": "This macbook turns on with no backlight and soon after the backlight tries to turn on and then goes back out. It boots up to the login screen and then whole computer shuts down. I notice the computer only turns on by itself and not when I press the power button. Except when I do an SMC reset the keyboard seems unresponsive. For example if I hold down the power button to try and shut it down, nothing happens. Same goes for when I try to do a hardware test holding down the D key and PRAM reset. Trackpad also seems to not be present as far as I can see when I hold a light to the back of the LCD. I also tried powering up without the keyboard in case it's liquid damaged but the computer still shuts down after the login screen. LCD back light circuit reads normal, replaced driver IC as well. I can't see any signs of liquid damage or corrosion, just cat hair at first."
