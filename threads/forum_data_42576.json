After that the board don't turn on and i noticed that U9480 was hot.. i found u9330 shorted replaced and short gone!! Now, the board start up normally but without image.. Not light on PENDRIVER!!\n\nQ9425 + Q3880 replaced and i have a working board and test in diode mode all pin's and have same values compare with a working board!\n\nPPBUS = 12.67V\nPPVCCSA_S0_CPU = 0.9V\nPP1V05_SUS - 1.05v\nPP1V05_S0 - 1.055v\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU 1.151\n\nalready replace a bios for new one with clean me no changes.. I don't touch in original one!\n\nany suggestion ??\n\nthank's"}
