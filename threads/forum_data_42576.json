    "definitions": {
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U9480": "What is U9480? a CHIP.",
        "U9330": "What is U9330? a CHIP.",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "PP1V05_SUS": "What is PP1V05_SUS? The PP1V05_SUS signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that supplies 1.05 volts, typically used in a suspended (SUS) state of the laptop. This state is a low-power mode where essential system functions are maintained, but the majority of the system is powered down..",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",
        "Q3880": "What is Q3880? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "Q9425": "What is Q9425? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "RAM_MODULES": "What is RAM_MODULES? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PPVBAT_G3H_CONN": "What is PPVBAT_G3H_CONN? This is the where the battery’s power rail connects to the motherboard. .",
        "SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL is another way to say SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL, look at the definition provided for SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL as it applies to ."

After that the board don't turn on and i noticed that <CHIP>U9480</CHIP> was hot.. i found <CHIP>U9330</CHIP> shorted replaced and short gone!! Now, the board start up normally but without image.. Not light on PENDRIVER!!\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q9425</TRANSISTOR> + <TRANSISTOR>Q3880</TRANSISTOR> replaced and i have a working board and test in diode mode all pin's and have same values compare with a working board!\n\nPPBUS = 12.67V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> = 0.9V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_SUS</SIGNAL> - 1.05v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> - 1.055v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> 1.151\n\nalready replace a bios for new one with clean me no changes.. I don't touch in original one!\n\nany suggestion ??\n\nthank's"
