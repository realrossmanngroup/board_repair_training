Its an 820-3437-B that looked to be in good shape except it was missing its BIOS chip and termination resistors. For grins I pulled a BIOS chip from another board and put the missing components back on. It posts and seems to run fine except it has symptoms of a bad ME region as it sits on the loading bar when trying to boot to a drive. Is it possible that the 3437-A I pulled the chip from is not compatible with the 3437-B?"}
