During visual inspection i found that it was missing <CHIP>TPS51980</CHIP>. I replaced this chip and i still not getting the fan to spin. Could the isl be causing this issue? I checked my voltages and I'm getting the following\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 0.10v\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 16.98v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 0.25\n\nThanks,"
