If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",

The board had some minor liquid-damage, nothing in the area of the keyboard or <CHIP>U5750</CHIP> or <CHIP>U5701</CHIP>. <CHIP>U5750</CHIP> has 3.42V at pin 10 and 3.3V at pin 4 and 6. I haven't seen this issue before so I'm not sure what's happening. It appears that <CHIP>U5750</CHIP> must not be doing what it's supposed to. Not sure though. Let me know if you anyone has any ideas about this."
