This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad. Each CD3215 in the system needs to be functioning in order for any of them to speak to the charger and negotiate receiving 20v from the charger rather than the default 5v that a USB-C charger puts out before communicating with the system. ."

I have yet to hear the fans spin fast though.\n\nWater damaged.  Someone has attempted to clean the board so corrosion is hard to find, but it's obvious water did hit near one of the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> ICs.\n\nThree of the four USB-C ports work fine, and will charge the machine with 20v and 2A.\n\nHowever the port in the back left does not work properly.  If I plug tester in one direction I get 5v and 0A, and if I flip the connection over the tester fails to even power on.\n\nEverything I have read says if one <CHIP>CD3515</CHIP> is bad, all USB ports will stop functioning.  If this is accurate information, does it rule out <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> problem here?"
