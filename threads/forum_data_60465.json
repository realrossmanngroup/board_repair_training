        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "U6903": "What is U6903? This chip is responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H in 2016-2018 model Macbook logic boards.",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_R": "What is PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_R? This is a power rail between the battery and a current sense resistor before the battery power feeds current to the rest of the machine. .",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",

Should I inject voltage on that line to see if there is something wrong?\n\nUPDATE: waited a few minutes and connected it to the usb c port which worked the first time, it went to .700A, connected it to the other usb c and goes to .025A and 0A repeatedly. If I go back to the usb c which worked right away it starts doing the same behavior..."
