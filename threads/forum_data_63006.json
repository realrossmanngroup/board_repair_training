            "message": "Hello. Got this board here that shuts itself down when stressed. I thought initially it was bad battery because it was indeed bad. So I replaced it three times and same thing. Decided putting in an original battery that's working perfectly on another machine and problem persists, so I discarded battery issue. I then started digging for the problem. As lots of these boards have GPU issues, I decided to flash GMUX with DOSDUDE method, but problem persists. ASD detects no issues with any sensors. The machine has problems with power connected and just on battery. Using genuine(bought directly from apple) 85W magsafe charger, so charger is not the issue here also. A strange thing I noticed is that when running on battery, if I launch coconut battery, even with GPU disabled, it gives some peaks of more than 60W of consumption, probably an error on sensor readings... I verified <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR>/21 and <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR>/51 and they read ok. Replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/35 and <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> just in case. Same issue, although read consumption lowered in average after replacing them, but still having random shut downs, also no matter if original battery or replacement one and no matter if it's on charger or on battery. I'm going nuts with this machine, it's a rabbit hole to hell..."
