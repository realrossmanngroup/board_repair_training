        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

See picture. Does anyone have any novel way of dealing with this type of thing? I need to get 3.3V to pin 10 but there's nothing I can tap in to. All I have is the 5V (then 20V) USB power line. I was thinking about trying to throw a couple resistors on there for a voltage divider but the problem is the line goes from 5V up to 20V so the voltage would be way to high on the enable once it bumps to 20V."
