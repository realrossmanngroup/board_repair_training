(actually is being sent to me)\n\nIt runs and displays fine to an external monitor. My sister said she shined her phone led into the back of the apple logo and doesn't see anything (while it is displaying on the external.)\nThere is no backlight and what seems to be, no image on the display as well.\n\nCould this be something crazy to fix, like a bad SMC, or is this most likely a combo of no backlight and something else that could cause video to go to an external, but not on the built in?\nOr what would cause the computer to not detect the screen at all (to not know to activate backlight and not send video...?)\n\nI'll get it in a couple days from her, but I wanted to get an idea before I got it.\n\nShe says she has never spilt liquid on or near the Air... and it has always been used with a legit OEM Apple original charger...\n\nThanks!"}
