        "message":"Hi guys I have a 820-3437 that came in working, but occasionally it would reboot itself. A quick check with the microscope revealed corrosion on one of the pins of U7501 was corroded\/burned (5v in). After removing the IC and scratch the dirt away I was able to fix the line as it was still there under the crap. Replaced the IC and now I got 3.3v on L7560 and 1.1v on L7520. It seems to powercycle, goes to 0v and then back to 1.1v stays there for a while and cycles again. Tried another IC same issie. Just because it looked crap, replaced Q7520 as well but still only get 1.1v on 5v line, seems something is pulling it down but if I check for short to ground I do not get a beep. I get 0.407 resistance to ground on both pins of L7520, any ideas?"
