            "message": "Hi guys I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that came in working, but occasionally it would reboot itself. A quick check with the microscope revealed corrosion on one of the pins of <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> was corroded/burned (5v in). After removing the IC and scratch the dirt away I was able to fix the line as it was still there under the crap. Replaced the IC and now I got 3.3v on L7560 and 1.1v on L7520. It seems to powercycle, goes to 0v and then back to 1.1v stays there for a while and cycles again. Tried another IC same issie. Just because it looked crap, replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR> as well but still only get 1.1v on 5v line, seems something is pulling it down but if I check for short to ground I do not get a beep. I get 0.407 resistance to ground on both pins of L7520, any ideas?"
