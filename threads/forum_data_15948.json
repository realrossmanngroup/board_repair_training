            "message": "Hey guys, I have this rabbit hole of a liquid damaged <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3435</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B board I'm working on. Initially, I started out replacing <RESISTOR>R5100</RESISTOR> -- it was so burnt, it basically fell off the board. Also, the board had a couple broken paths by traces I was able to repair easily by <CAPACITOR>C5001</CAPACITOR>/L5001 (TP[1]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA</SIGNAL>), and <CAPACITOR>C7503</CAPACITOR> to TP[1]<SIGNAL>P5VP3V3_VREG3</SIGNAL> by <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>. Both of these areas were visibly corroded, and besides some semi-burnt looking trace points, which I checked for continuity (they passed), these seem to be the only issues I can visibly detect after many sweeps of the board.\n\nWhen I started with this board there was no light of any kind. I went through the rails, and decided to replace <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, which restored charger light. Moving on, I decided to replace <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>, because of its proximity to <CAPACITOR>C7503</CAPACITOR>/TP[1]<SIGNAL>P5VP3V3_VREG3</SIGNAL> and because of heavy corrosion in that area. However, I'm reading 0.0 voltage on <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>, and for some reason <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> is reading 0.2V. Consequently, Pin 4 of <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> is only reading 0.2V (I think it's supposed to be ~3.4), which I believe is causing <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> to not generate .\n\nAdditionally, after measuring all my power rails for shorts, I discovered a fluctuating short on <SIGNAL>P3V3_S5</SIGNAL> (the short is usually 38Ohms, but sometimes it goes to 80Ohms or 100Ohms, and occasionally it reads a solid 90Ohms on the meter, while beeping at me like morse code). Weirdly enough, the voltage I read on <SIGNAL>P3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is 3.34V. I've actually gone through every component on the board which is connected to the rail, and nothing visibly jumped out as a shorted component. However, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC</SIGNAL> are NOT showing a short -- this is an area where I repaired a broken path and replaced <RESISTOR>R5100</RESISTOR>. Thinking the short could possibly be in the SMC, and because I couldn't figure out how those two relate to <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, I decided to reflow the SMC, however no voltages changed.\n\nThe relevant voltages on <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> read as following:\nPin 4 - 0.2V\nPin 21 - 3.419V\nPin 12 - 3.419V\n\nPin 3 - 1.254V\nPin 13 - 2.006V (Is this right? Isn't it supposed to be ~3.3V, or is that only after <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL>?)\nPin 23 - 8.63V\nPin 29 - 5.05V\nPin 22 - 3.314V\nPin 14 - 5.05V\nPin 12 - 3.419V\nPin 24 - 3.459V\nPin 2 - 0.0V\n\nAnyway, I've hit the wall on this one, and it's to the point where I HAVE to fix it, just for the principle of it. Any advice is appreciated. Let me know if you need any other voltages.\n\nEdit: Also, I did an SMC reset, and the charger turned green and then back to orange."

After that I might take the SMC off and see what's going on underneath -- hopefully the pads are still there.\n\nThat said, shouldn't <SIGNAL>SMC_CLK32K</SIGNAL> be showing the right amount of voltage on <RESISTOR>R5112</RESISTOR>, or could an SMC short be pulling that down? Also, is it possible any of this is caused by that weird short on <SIGNAL>P3V3_S5</SIGNAL> that doesn't effect the voltage, or could the SMC cause that as well?[/QUOTE]\n\nyou must be either tommy or colin. expect something to arrive by tuesday-wednesday latest!"

With resistance that low, shouldn't the rail be a fraction of what it should be?\n\n\n\n[QUOTE=\"larossmann, post: 15982\"]\n\nyou must be either tommy or colin. expect something to arrive by tuesday-wednesday latest![/QUOTE]\n\nGood guess!

That measurement has had me scratching my head for a bit.  I'm just getting started out, so I thought anything that didn't read 0L was passing current to ground.  When is it considered a short, then?  Does that just come with more experience with certain rails, or is there some baseline you would look for?  Also, does that mean a connection to ground is built into the rail somewhere?  I measure with red on ground and black on the lead.  \n\n[QUOTE=\"2informaticos, post: 15999\"]\nAt this moment, does your board try to start at least; with charger, battery, or both?[/QUOTE]\nNo fan spin. Just orange light on charger.\n\n<CHIP>U7501</CHIP> isn't getting the proper voltage on pin 4, because the sleep signals aren't present.  So <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> isn't generating.\n\nThanks for the help so far!"
