Initially, I started out replacing R5100 -- it was so burnt, it basically fell off the board. Also, the board had a couple broken paths by traces I was able to repair easily by C5001\/L5001 (TP[1]PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA), and C7503 to TP[1]P5VP3V3_VREG3 by U7501. Both of these areas were visibly corroded, and besides some semi-burnt looking trace points, which I checked for continuity (they passed), these seem to be the only issues I can visibly detect after many sweeps of the board.\n\nWhen I started with this board there was no light of any kind. I went through the rails, and decided to replace U7100, which restored charger light. Moving on, I decided to replace U7501, because of its proximity to C7503\/TP[1]P5VP3V3_VREG3 and because of heavy corrosion in that area. However, I'm reading 0.0 voltage on PM_SLP_S5_L, and for some reason PM_SLP_S4_L is reading 0.2V. Consequently, Pin 4 of U7501 is only reading 0.2V (I think it's supposed to be ~3.4), which I believe is causing PP5V_S4RS3 to not generate .\n\nAdditionally, after measuring all my power rails for shorts, I discovered a fluctuating short on P3V3_S5 (the short is usually 38Ohms, but sometimes it goes to 80Ohms or 100Ohms, and occasionally it reads a solid 90Ohms on the meter, while beeping at me like morse code). Weirdly enough, the voltage I read on P3V3_S5 is 3.34V. I've actually gone through every component on the board which is connected to the rail, and nothing visibly jumped out as a shorted component. However, PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA and PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC are NOT showing a short -- this is an area where I repaired a broken path and replaced R5100. Thinking the short could possibly be in the SMC, and because I couldn't figure out how those two relate to PP3V3_S5, I decided to reflow the SMC, however no voltages changed.\n\nThe relevant voltages on U7501 read as following:\nPin 4 - 0.2V\nPin 21 - 3.419V\nPin 12 - 3.419V\n\nPin 3 - 1.254V\nPin 13 - 2.006V (Is this right? Isn't it supposed to be ~3.3V, or is that only after PP5V_S4RS3?)\nPin 23 - 8.63V\nPin 29 - 5.05V\nPin 22 - 3.314V\nPin 14 - 5.05V\nPin 12 - 3.419V\nPin 24 - 3.459V\nPin 2 - 0.0V\n\nAnyway, I've hit the wall on this one, and it's to the point where I HAVE to fix it, just for the principle of it. Any advice is appreciated. Let me know if you need any other voltages.\n\nEdit: Also, I did an SMC reset, and the charger turned green and then back to orange."}

I actually went through every single connection on the P3V3_S5 line, which was over 50 measurements on both sides of the board -- no power attached -- and the drop to ground was steady on every component in the line.
