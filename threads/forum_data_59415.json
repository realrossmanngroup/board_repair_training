This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present.

            "message": "TLDR - Early 2015 MBP Retina was dropped and had liquid damage as well. When plugged in it turns itself on until manually forced off. No display and no external on hdmi as well. \n\nLong story, bought a 13\" <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> Early 2015 and figured it had been dropped based on the listing. Little did I know it was dropped and had liquid damage in the corner near the lcd connector. The indicator in the middle of the board wasn't triggered. It arrived and I plugged the power in and it turned on by itself. \n\nI'm assuming a short somewhere, but the screen stayed pitch black. I should have tried the flashlight trick to see if the backlight was out, but already had the board out by the time I remembered that as I wanted to try a known working board I had in it. The other board worked fine with the magsafe and also the screen obviously. \n\nI've checked the board and the only thing I can come up with so far is a faulty FDC638APZ IC but still waiting for the chips to come in. So, I'm not sure where to go from here on the magsafe triggering the laptop on. Was considering putting it in my ultrasonic to clean it up before I get started again tracking down the issue. \n\nWhat do you guys think?"

I think they said non-retina too, but any one I see on ebay always are retina. \n\nBy the way, I'm pretty positive that one of the issues, if not the main issue is the LCD connector. I say that because when I went to look at the video cable as you told me to do I noticed that on one side it looked like some plastic was missing. I looked inside the connector and a chunk of it had melted together inside the connector. Probably when the water hit it I think. I'll order a couple just in case something sets it off again to melt it. \n\nSo, going to order the connector now to get it here the fastest. Going to be later this week that I post an update at the soonest.\n\nThanks again for all your help so far. I'll talk to you later this week or early next week."
