Already replaced <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> with poly-film cap.\n- Pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> is 1.5v.\n- Fans will spin in SMC bypass mode, but no chime or boot.\n- Unsure of clock signal--it seems to be called something other than <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>? Is it the XOUT pin of <CHIP>U2700</CHIP>?\n- Green light consistently takes several seconds (5-8) to turn on, but once it does, it stays on and is steady. Tried several known-good DC-in boards.\n- CPU/GPU both get warm (normal-warm, not blazing hot), as if they're active, but vcore is not present (0v).\n\nAny ideas? Since I have <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> at the fan, but no fan spin, does this mean the SMC isn't communicating properly? Since it controls the fans, etc. No idea how <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> can both be present, but no fan spin? SMC? Sort of a weird one, but it's a 2850, so I'm not surprised...probably a dead CPU or GPU."
