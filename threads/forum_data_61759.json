        "A1707": "What is A1707? A1707 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3072, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00281, 820-00928..",
        "820-00928": "What is 820-00928? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "R8432": "What is R8432? a RESISTOR.",

        "Q8400": "What is Q8400? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with ‚Äú_EN‚Äù , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says ‚ÄúBKL‚Äù before ‚Äú_EN‚Äù. ‚ÄúBKL‚Äù sounds short for ‚ÄúBACKLIGHT‚Äù, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The ‚Äú_R‚Äù suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the ‚Äú_L‚Äù  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",

        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see ‚Äú_EN‚Äù, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, ‚ÄúEDP_BKLT‚Äù which stands for ‚Äúembedded displayport backlight‚Äù is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
