            "message": "Hello, I have here a MacBook Pro 13\" <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00239</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that does not turn on. The owner says it happend after he has plugged a fake charger. One of the USB-C ports is dead, the other three draw 5.12 V and 0.4 A.  Under the thermal cam I can see three components getting warm: UB300, <TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> and <DIODE>D6902</DIODE>. My guess is, that UB300 might be the problem, as it is close to the broken port. As it seems to be an underfilled chip I do not want to remove it unnecessarily. How should I proceed?"
