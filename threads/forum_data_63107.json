The owner says it happend after he has plugged a fake charger. One of the USB-C ports is dead, the other three draw 5.12 V and 0.4 A.  Under the thermal cam I can see three components getting warm: UB300, Q3200 and D6902. My guess is, that UB300 might be the problem, as it is close to the broken port. As it seems to be an underfilled chip I do not want to remove it unnecessarily. How should I proceed?"}
