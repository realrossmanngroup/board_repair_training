If this sensor is included, that is how you will know if it is on the trackpad. If not, connect trackpad back and repeat same procedure but this time disconnect webcam cable."

That is Heatpipe 2!\n\nI have been keeping track of HWmonitor sensors and their locations adding to my text file but had nothing for Heatpipe 2.   Now I know!  Very hard problem to figure out.
