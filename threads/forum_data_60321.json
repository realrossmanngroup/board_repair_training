And initially was stucked at 120mAmp. After cleaning replacing <RESISTOR>R8185</RESISTOR>, It stopped taking 120mAmp but now when power on takes 180-220mAmp for 1 second only then goes to zero. i also check at same time it produces S0 rails and Powergood signals just for 1 Sec.  I didn't found any other liquid damage or short circuit. check SPI Rom and related signal all are present and normal. when it is in off state, only have S5 rails. <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWORK</SIGNAL> goes off.  I looked for some other stuffs but i have admit i don't know where to look?"
