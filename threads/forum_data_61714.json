It had a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> specifically <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> was burned and I replaced it, but also before that as i was following the short i took out <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and then resoldered it. Now the short in gone but it's stuck on 5v. I have all the LDO lines on <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>(CD3215A)... Any ideas?\n\nThanks  ðŸ––"
