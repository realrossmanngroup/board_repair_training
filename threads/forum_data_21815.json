            "message": "Working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board with no audio; headphones do work, but when headphones are NOT plugged into the board, the audio icon is greyed out and I get the prohibitory sign when attempting to adjust volume. I've had this issue (or a similar one) before, and removing <RESISTOR>R6895</RESISTOR> resolved (or bypassed) the issue.\n\nI removed <RESISTOR>R6895</RESISTOR> on this board, and it did not resolve the issue, but instead made it more odd; now, I get no audio (still), however when I plug the headphones in, I DO get audio through the speakers but NOT the headphones. No audio whatsoever through the headphones when they are plugged in. As soon as I unplug the headphones, then I get no audio through the speakers again. So, I've replaced <RESISTOR>R6895</RESISTOR> and I'm back to square one.\n\nAll surrounding resistors are measuring fine, and there's no sign of liquid. Does this sound like a bad <CHIP>U6201</CHIP>? Headphone jack is part of a known-good test case, so I don't think that's the issue. All help appreciated."

            "message": "I got this one solved; I removed <RESISTOR>R6895</RESISTOR>, but needed to remove <RESISTOR>R6896</RESISTOR>. Once I removed <RESISTOR>R6896</RESISTOR> (and replaced <RESISTOR>R6895</RESISTOR>), all is well. Disabling SPDIF works again; but I am curious--what is the ultimate cause of this specific failure, where disabling the SPDIF works to resolve the issue? Is it <CHIP>U6201</CHIP> that's faulty, or one of the transistors on that circuit? Is it better to repair the actual root cause (one would think yes), rather than simply disabling a feature (albeit used by hardly anyone)? Just curious.\n\nMark this one as solved!"
