        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

Got steady <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, steady <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, pulsing DDR Voltage and pulsing PCH VCORE, no pulsing on CPU VCORE though. Replaced RTC chip just in case, still same. Steady 3.3V on PPVRTC. There was a little bit of corrosion near J5100, which I cleaned. Still same. Where should I start?"
