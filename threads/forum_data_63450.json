I reflashed the bios with a clean me bin that I downloaded from this forum no difference.\n\nL7211, L7221, L7231 on boot: 1.112 then 0.700 A\n\nPCH and other chips get hot but not really hot (please see pics)\nThe videos are the amperage behaviour while booting, the first is with the battery attached, the second is without battery attached. When the battery is connected doesnt make one reboot cycle. I think the battery is already charged because before with the battery connected it was using like 1Amp more. Both videos are with the board connected (everything connected) I tried disconnecting one by one trackpad, keyboard, touchpad, etc and same problem.\n\nBattery attached\n[MEDIA=imgur]a/SO7Fh0y[/MEDIA]\n\nNo Battery attached\n[MEDIA=imgur]a/0enoGKa[/MEDIA]"
