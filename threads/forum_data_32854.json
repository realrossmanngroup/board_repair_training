After ultrasonic cleaning it turned on and appeared to be normal. The trackpad got hit and the trackpad connector on the board needed pins 44, 46, 48 and 50 resoldered. Everything works fine, but just slow. Online test gave no errors. Battery is good. I'm including pre-ultrasonic pics. Any ideas what might be causing this?"}

PP3V0_G3H_AVREF_SMC was measuring about .735 to ground in diode mode. A good board is around .535. I pulled U5165 and pin 8 was charred. Cleaned it up and replaced U5165 and all is well. Thanks for the tip."}
