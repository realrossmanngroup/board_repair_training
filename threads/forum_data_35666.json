        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

            "message": "This board has thoroughly kicked my ass. I'm pretty comfortable with this type of issue, but this one I fear may have a CPU issue...\n\n1. No video, no backlight. I do think the board had liquid at some point based on the eDP connector, but it must have been minor because no corrosion on any caps or anything.\n2. 5v at L8300 for about 6 seconds, then it goes straight to 0v\n3. Boots to external just fine; when I view displays in system prefs, nothing shows except the external display.\n4. Diode on my eDP connector all match a working board. Voltages don't of course.\n5. <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is high (3.3v)\n6. Known-good 2015 display; tested with 2 other boards, display is definitely working fine.\n7. Didn't find any shorts on <SIGNAL>5V_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>5V_S0</SIGNAL> or anything.\n\nWhen I do have 5v on L8300, there's no LCD activity at all, not even briefly. No panel shifting or data of any kind. Replaced <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> and <CHIP>U8330</CHIP> out of frustration because they do resolve a ton of these backlight/video issues, but no change at all. Replaced eDP connector because it had scaling from the board being cleaned, and it didn't look \"perfect\" (not damaged, but not A+). \n\nAny help or direction appreciated...this one has me baffled."
