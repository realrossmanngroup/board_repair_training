        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",

Also possibly <RESISTOR>R6950</RESISTOR>, which looks is the path for the battery to ground for it to detect it is connected to a computer, maybe if that isn't there it won't talk on 4/5. Just speculating from the schematic."
