Have cleaned it up and fixed the following issues:\n1) <CAPACITOR>C7136</CAPACITOR> completely exploded and burned <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR</SIGNAL> to ground inside the board - have done some digging around where <CAPACITOR>C7136</CAPACITOR> was and cleared this short\n2) Backlight feedback to <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> was broken next to L7701/<DIODE>D7701</DIODE>- have repaired this with a jumper wire. \n\nThe issue is board will start fine without the left i/o board connected, it runs gives backlight etc. If the left i/o board is connected I get the orange light and it wont start - tried with known good i/o board, known good connecting cable and known good battery - it wont start at all. \n\nIf I were to connect the Left I/O Board after the fan starts to spin after applying power from charger with battery connected I just get the display with the battery charging symbol then it powers back off and no reaction to power button - power button is working normally when left i/o board isn't connected. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is giving 8.6V as I would expect when the orange light is lit. \n\nI know these boards wont normally start without the battery being plugged in so I'm thinking maybe this is an issue with the battery circuit."

            "message": "Thats a good question - i'm not 100% sure it is original but it certainly looks it - it's an 85W one. \n\nFound out why it wasn't starting eventually - it was <RESISTOR>R5501</RESISTOR> not connected on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> side. Now i've got another issue that the board appears to start but after I shut it down and leave it for a bit it won't start up again and gives the \"I need charging\" symbol (on battery) or the \"charging\" symbol on the screen (on charger) - battery is at 100%. If I do an SMC reset it'll usually then start up and shows the battery at 100%. I've got a battery on order to test so i'll report back if that fixes it."
