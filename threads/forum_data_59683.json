No water damage or visible corrosion. Tested with other power board.\n\nGetting 3.47 V (instead of 3.42 V) on PP3V42_G3H, 15.1 (possibly instead of 18.5 V or at least instead of 14.85 V) on PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL using 45 W charger. I'm a bit new to this - are these values normal for these lines?\n\nSince it seems like the onewire circuit is likely fine and just a multimeter precision thing, perhaps the issue lies with the battery circuit? I can't find much info about the specific conditions that make the orange light show up. Which general circuit should I be looking at?"}

Sorry for the misunderstanding. No water spill, just a few bits of dirt and hair. Customer report:\nPlugged laptop in and left it for a few hours, came back and it had turned off completely. Pressed power button and machine didn't turn on. Charger light remained orange even after hours of charging.\n\nJust made a mistake - the multimeter touched R5501 pin 1 (PPBUS_G3H) when testing PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL on R7005 pin 1. There was a spark and R7005 seems to have damage on its solder pad on board. Still has an orange light, though. Is it likely that I can just replace that resistor?"}
