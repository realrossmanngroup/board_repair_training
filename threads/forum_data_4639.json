            "message": "I have a 2013 13\" Macbook Air that had beer spill damage. There was corrosion around SMC and wifi card and a little on DC in-board. It was not turning on at all and no light on the charger. After putting it in the ultrasonic it worked but the fan spins on high even though the trackpad and everything necessary is plugged in. The machine boots up and everything and I am able to log in but if I push spots around the board (such as I/O board cable ) it will just shut off or if I plug in a USB or something while logged in it will shut off.\n\nThe I/O board connector(J9500) that is on the logic board is missing the gold pin(49) which connects to ground. I tried soldering a small piece of wire in there to solve this problem but that didn't help anything. Could that bad connector be causing these problems? I have a donor board that has this connector but I don't know how I would replace it without burning the connector from the donor board like when removing an lcd connector.\n\nI have tested with a different power board and cable.\n\nI am trying to run ASD but I am waiting on the password from the owner.\n\nHere are images of the connector where I put the small piece of wire on the top left pin [URL=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4isuqcas6rnfg3i/AACCRxIRetDGY5JQL5ugJoMua?dl=0\"]https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4isuqcas6...L5ugJoMua?dl=0[/URL]\n\n\nUpdate: After putting the back cover on the machine and using it for about 10 minutes I didn't have any random shutoffs after inserting a usb or hitting the back cover but the fan is still spinning on high."

Do you think that missing ground pin of the connector could be causing the fan to spin high. I just don't want to replace that hard component if it won't be the cause.\nAlso, I don't have a preheater so would putting the heat on max damage the components on the bottom side of the board? Should I try putting the board in the oven for a little while to help it come off easier?\n\nLast question. What preheater do you use? Hakko?"
