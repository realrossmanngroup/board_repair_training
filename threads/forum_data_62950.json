Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

This is on external display, nothing on recovery and nothing on diagnostic.\n\non the LCD i get nothing(known good LCD), i'm not getting <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> for backlight enable, i do have 5v and 3v3 going into the tcon.\ni'm not sure if the no boot symptom is causing no display.\n\nupdate** SMC bypass mode gives me low battery sign"
