        "message":"Hi guys I have an 00165 that came in with a tiny bit of corrosion on C7615 and R7611, replaced them. Also customer broke the battery connector, so replaced that as well. Now the mac gets an orange line, fan starts to spin, all voltages come up for DRAM and also CPU Vcore 1.2v, 1.3v and 1.8v, then after a few seconds it shuts down. I do get a ALL [U]SYS[\/U]PWRGD signal as well at 3.2v. Could this be ROM related, or when the fan starts to spin it means not a ROM issue? I also have clock signal for the cpu present and USB mouse activity, until it shuts down. Any ideas? Board looks very clean."
