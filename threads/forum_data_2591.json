        "message":"This is a new one for me. Everything seems to be working fine, but it gets stuck when the progress bar hits 100%. It takes a little while for it to get there, so it's moving slowly as it tries to boot. I've tried multiple SSD's, external drives, different operating systems and nothing changes it. The board was obviously spilled on but it's getting to me after it's already been cleaned. I don't think any components have been switched though, just the board cleaned. Any ideas or insight would be greatly appreciated."

The only issue is the startup time is long, about 45 seconds. It actually takes it about 19 seconds just to find the OS and show the Apple. Internal SSD is selected in System Preferences. I tried another SSD with the same result. Temperature on SSD is hitting around 55 degrees Celsius (measured externally by infrared.) That seems about 25 degrees too high compared to another Air. Booting from an external SSD takes about 2 minutes. Everything about the computer seems to be running great other than this."
