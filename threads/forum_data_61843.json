        "PP3V3_G3H_RTC": "What is PP3V3_G3H_RTC? PP3V3_G3H_RTC Is one of the first rails that has to come on in order for the USB-C mux chip to be powered in the T2 chip Macbook Pros..",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",

This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

The board was first taking 0v on left side and 5v 0.3amp on the right side ports. After opening up and inspecting, i saw that on the left side usb c cable was actually not plugged in and the connector on motherboard was damaged and i presume it was damaged in previous shop and not by the impact it self (they screwed the metallic clamp on top still). I tried to fix the connector(it was a bit bend) and plugged it back, got 5v on this side as well.\n\nHowever i didn't like how the connector was looking i removed in to be sure there is no shorts in it.. still 5v on the other side..\n\nMy understandings is that there is one of CD chips that is blown witch affect the whole system there fore i have multiple questions:\n\nBest way to get this chip? If its from a donner board then it does need reball? How to get the old chip out (compound around it).\n\nAnd also regarding the connector, is it possible to use from a donor board or must be new? My understanding is that it will have to be soldered on using hot air since no access to pins, how then i should menage it in sort to be sure everything is soldered right and also not melt it?\n\nEdit: Forgot to check <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>, will do that tomorrow, but have a feeling its not related to charger ic..\n\nThank you!"
