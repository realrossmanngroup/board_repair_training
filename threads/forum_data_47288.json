CPU isn't getting very warm (oh no), and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is at 12.67v, but should be closer to 13.1v I believe. I'd normally suspect a CPU or BIOS issue with these symptoms, but aren't so sure on newer models. Would like some confirmation here before getting that far.\n\nNo liquid, no drop or any other damage. I'll gather measurements now and will add them in, but wanted to ask first if <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> being ~12.67v is \"too low\" for this model? I know ~12.26v on the older boards means SMC is not turning on (or isn't communicating with ISL), but typically that would result in no fan spin. On these newer models, would they be able to have fan spin if SMC is bad? I'd not think so, but wanted to check, as I've seen in some other threads that ppbus being 12.6v could indicate an issue.\n\nWill return with more measurements shortly, thanks in advance!"

The PCH does not get warm, no; nothing gets warm really at all--CPU has a very, very, very slight warmth (5% of normal), but not much at all.\n\nJust to confirm: <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> on this model should definitely be 13.1v, correct? And it being 12.6v indicates an SMC/<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>/Comms/Trace issue (similar to 12.26v on older boards), correct? So I should go ahead and replace <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, then the SMC, and see if it resolves? I just want to confirm that ppbus should be 13.1v on this model before assuming the issue is a low ppbus and wasting the time; I know on some other models, the schematics are wrong, and ppbus actually differs from what's written (i.e. on the older 17\" boards, for example).\n\nCan you please let me know if there's anything else I should check prior to replacing <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>?

            "message": "OK, a bit of an update, as behavior has changed:\n\n1. I think ppbus being 12.6v is fine. I think this might be acceptable, and have found threads previous with the 15\" Touchbar boards having ppbus at 12.6v. I'm going to assume this is unrelated to the issue. Also, I don't believe I'd see any sign of fan spin if ppbus were not correct (or sufficient), and it isn't running on 5v, so all seems well with SMC-->ISL comms.\n2. To be sure there was no crap under SMC (even though this wasn't a spill unit), I went ahead and reflowed the SMC, <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and USB-C controllers.\n3. I noticed the CPU actually DOES get very, very hot for a very short time--i.e. ~1 second--right when I hit the power button (or connect charger). I didn't notice this at first, because CPU spikes in heat and then cools off within just a few seconds. I thought it wasn't getting hot at all, but it is.\n4. I got the board installed back into the unit and it now charges/powers/boots--hooray!\n\nMight have just been a case of crap under SMC or USBC controllers. Who knows, but we'll see if it continues to work without issue. I've seen similar behavior on units with failing SMCs (inconsistent power over days/weeks, etc). Will be interesting to see if that issue extends to the newer models, so will update thread if anything changes."
