It also turned off and did not turn on again\n\nfirst I had a short in C7900 and C7901. I have removed both capacitors and now there is no short and I can measure PPBUS_G3H 12.5v but it still won't turn on. If I try to connect the charger with the battery, the battery symbol appears in red but the fan does not turn and does not turn on.\n\nis it necessary to replace the capacitors to test? or can it be tested without closing the circuit?\n\nPPBUS_G3H 0v\nPP3V42 G3H REG 3.39v\nPP5V S4 0v\nPP5V_S3 0v\nP5VS4_ES 0v\nPM SLP S5 L 0v\nS5 PwrGd 3.36v\n(P5VP3V3_VREF2) 1,96v"}
