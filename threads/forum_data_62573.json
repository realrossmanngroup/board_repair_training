            "message": "This board is similar to the one in the other post but it has different current measurements. It also turned off and did not turn on again\n\nfirst I had a short in <CAPACITOR>C7900</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7901</CAPACITOR>. I have removed both capacitors and now there is no short and I can measure <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.5v but it still won't turn on. If I try to connect the charger with the battery, the battery symbol appears in red but the fan does not turn and does not turn on.\n\nis it necessary to replace the capacitors to test? or can it be tested without closing the circuit?\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 0v\nPP3V42 G3H REG 3.39v\nPP5V S4 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>P5VS4_ES</SIGNAL> 0v\nPM SLP S5 L 0v\nS5 PwrGd 3.36v\n(<SIGNAL>P5VP3V3_VREF2</SIGNAL>) 1,96v"
