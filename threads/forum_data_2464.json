The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off.."

Only problem when I set the brightness it's not smooth, it's not continues.\nIt's \"flashing\" laggy when I set the brightness. I didn't really have this problem before.\n\nOnly blacklight problem I had it was no backlight, or I could see the leds at the bottom of the LCD.\nChanging the backlight sense resistors always solved that, but this is different now.\n\nThe second problem is that when it goes to sleep mode, it won't come back, if I press any button on keyboard.\nIt just comes back if I press the power button. I have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL>. \n\nThank you."

I was hoping it's not the PCH. I changed SMC and the sleep problem was resolved.\nI changed the LED driver(it came from digikey) from another board and that solve the backlight problem.\nI tried to make a video, but I can't really see the backlight problem on the video.\n\nThe macbook runs ok now, little bit hot but it's working.\n\nSolved.\n\nThank you!"
