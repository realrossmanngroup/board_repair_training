I dont use it for gaming or graphic rendering.\n\nI have reflowed the GPU twice as it has died. I'm aware reflowing is not a permanent fix. It's a bad bandaid.\n\nanyway.. I reflowed it today, and now it won't boot.\n\nproblem..\nwhen I plug in the mag, it's the genuine 85w mag, the light remains green.\nand upon plugging the mag in the fans try and spins, like jerking every 1 to 2 seconds.\n\nI have checked rails\n\nppbus_g3h is good\npp3v4_g3h is good\npp5v_s0 is not there\npp1v05_s0 is not there and its shorted.\non pp3v3_s5 I'm getting 2.707v unstable, moving from 2.703 to 2.762 correct me if I'm wrong.
