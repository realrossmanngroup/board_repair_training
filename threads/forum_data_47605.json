I used tweezers. But I totally understand that it is good to make these clear. Thanks for that and sorry if my English is not that precise. Not my native language.\n\nWhat does the rise in the <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> mean or could you please tell what should I check next?\nThis board should start up when the power (USB) is connected or do I remember wrong from Louis videos?\n\nI saw voltage fluctuation on <SIGNAL>CPUCORE_PHASE1</SIGNAL> from 0.2-1.2V but went back to 0V soon. This happened when I just measured after leaving it on the table with the charger connected, before shorting the <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL>.\n\nAny tips or suggestion would be great as the customer is coming to pick up the device tomorrow, repaired or not.
