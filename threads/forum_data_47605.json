(This is atleast how the story goes :)\nNo signs of liquid damage.\n\nCharger voltage 15v and it is not taking any current. (Don?t know if the battery is full).\nDon?t know what should I measure for you, so just tell me what values you want and I will gladly get them.\n\nHere are some measurements from the board:\n\nQ3100 Pin-8 = 14.7V\nPPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H = 14.7V\nPPBUS_G3H is 8.7V\n\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS = 8.7V\nPP5V_G3H = 5V\nPP5V_S5 = 5V\nPP5V_S4 = 0 V\n\nPP3V3R3V0_AON = 3.3V\nPP3V3_G3H = 3.3V\nPP3V3_S5 =  3.3V\nPP3V3_SUS = 0V\npp1v8_SUS= 0V  (pulsing?)\nP1V8SUS_PGOOD= 0V\n\nAny help or suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!"}

Nice to know, that there is no voltage on the display connector. And the panel type.\n\nAll measurements are done with just the board and PSU. I took the board out before doing anything.\n\nI might have wrong word for pulsing, sorry. My multimeter has a line that makes pulses and that what I have tried to describe. Other S3\/4 voltages are not \"pulsing\" when I measured them.\n\nPM_SLP_S4_L rises to 0.06V when SMC_ON_OFF_L  is shorted to ground."}

I used tweezers. But I totally understand that it is good to make these clear. Thanks for that and sorry if my English is not that precise. Not my native language.\n\nWhat does the rise in the PM_SLP_S4_L mean or could you please tell what should I check next?\nThis board should start up when the power (USB) is connected or do I remember wrong from Louis videos?\n\nI saw voltage fluctuation on CPUCORE_PHASE1 from 0.2-1.2V but went back to 0V soon. This happened when I just measured after leaving it on the table with the charger connected, before shorting the SMC_ONOFF.\n\nAny tips or suggestion would be great as the customer is coming to pick up the device tomorrow, repaired or not. Don?t get me wrong, I really appreciate all the help and I don?t want to sound ungrateful.\n\nThanks!"}
