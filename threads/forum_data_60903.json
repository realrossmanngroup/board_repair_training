        "message":"Water damage around U1980.   Which is the PP2V5_NAND_SSD0 supply.\nHad to replace this chip to get 2.5V rail back.   But what is scary is it's supply was PPBUS G3H.   So it is safe to assume that 12V hit the SSD line.  I replaced the IC and cleaned up the damage and this supply is back up.  \n\nNow the unit appears to boot but will not display a image.   I don't see any hot spots so I am pretty sure the water damage is repaired.   Would it be safe to assume the SSSD's are toast?\n\nIs this repairable?"
