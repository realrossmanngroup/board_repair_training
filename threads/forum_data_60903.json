But what is scary is it's supply was PPBUS G3H.   So it is safe to assume that 12V hit the SSD line.  I replaced the IC and cleaned up the damage and this supply is back up.  \n\nNow the unit appears to boot but will not display a image.   I don't see any hot spots so I am pretty sure the water damage is repaired.   Would it be safe to assume the SSSD's are toast?\n\nIs this repairable?"
