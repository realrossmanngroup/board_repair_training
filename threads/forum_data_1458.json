When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution.

Replaced them both. Near them were some corroded components that I replaced.\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> was corrosion underneath it, removed it and cleaned everything. Not sure if I replaced it, forgot to take note and the laptop sat for some time waiting for a new battery.\nNow the laptop runs almost normally except that it charges extremely slow and discharges quickly, and I felt some heat coming from <TRANSISTOR>Q7635</TRANSISTOR>, L630.\nTested the line between them and I got 13 OHM resistance to ground. I narrowed this low resistance to <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL>. Is this normal in any way? Never worked on this line before and have no idea!\nNote: <CHIP>U7971</CHIP> which I had replaced has nothing to do with it. Removing it doesn't change resistance to ground of <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL>."

By the time you replied I had reballed it.\nI can confirm also that it was not causing the interruptions because it is still doing it, though less. Heating may have reflowed something although I can't see what?!\nLD was around <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> and I found what seem to be oxidized pads on the chip, and the image did flicker sometimes so I hope I did not do useless work.\nBefore replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> as suggested by apprentiz, I had slow charging and orange light. After replacing \"no charging\" and only green light.\nFirst time I worked on it, via from <RESISTOR>R7052</RESISTOR> to <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> was corroded and I had to jump. So I poked around and found missing line between Pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> and Pin 16 of ISL. Must have failed during last rework. After jumping <SIGNAL>CHGR_BGATE</SIGNAL> the laptop is back to charging and orange light, BUT still restarts if I poke next to <CHIP>U9600</CHIP>. Not sure if this is something I need to address?\nI am going to test speed of charging now."
