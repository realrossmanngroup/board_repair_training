            "message": "Hi guys I have a macbook air that came in with liquid damage. Liquid at <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> and I replaced <CAPACITOR>C6100</CAPACITOR>. Also liquid around SMC replaced: <CHIP>U3710</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q5158</TRANSISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R5158</RESISTOR> and did a SMC reflow for good measure. When connecting power the fan starts to spin (not 3 times though) and I get only a green light. After about 30-40 seconds the board switches off. CPU gets hot, I got <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> on <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> and when I connect a mouse i do get a red light so it seems the SMC is doing something. PPBUS is at 8.17v though which usually indicates faulty SMC? Any suggestions?"
