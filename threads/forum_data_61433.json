        "A1932": "What is A1932? A1932 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Late 2018, 2019 with EMC 3184, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01521..",
        "820-01521": "What is 820-01521? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
