Do this by disconnecting all power sources (Battery + Magsafe) and having the power button pressed (or with R5115\/16) while plugging the charger in. Keep the button pressed until the device powers on, if it doesn't do that after 15 seconds you can give up because it should've started already. Make 100% Sure the power button (or eqv.) is pressed when any power source is applied or the SMC will be booted and you would need to disconnect all power again first"}
