        "message":"Hello!, got this touchbar board 820-00239 which has question mark. Board had no signs of liquid damage, P2V7NAND was not present so inspected J9600 and one of the pins seemed to be damaged, replaced connector, P2V7NAND came up, thought sorted, but after couple of seconds smoke came up from U9400, replaced U9400, but now P2V7NAND on C9421 not present again, but measuring C9402 i get 13V which is ppbus power rail. Which components should i inspect to find short? i suppose it is one of the lines from U9400? Thank you in advance! :)"
