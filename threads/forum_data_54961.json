            "message": "Hello!, got this touchbar board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00239</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> which has question mark. Board had no signs of liquid damage, P2V7NAND was not present so inspected J9600 and one of the pins seemed to be damaged, replaced connector, P2V7NAND came up, thought sorted, but after couple of seconds smoke came up from <CHIP>U9400</CHIP>, replaced <CHIP>U9400</CHIP>, but now P2V7NAND on <CAPACITOR>C9421</CAPACITOR> not present again, but measuring <CAPACITOR>C9402</CAPACITOR> i get 13V which is ppbus power rail. Which components should i inspect to find short? i suppose it is one of the lines from <CHIP>U9400</CHIP>? Thank you in advance! :)"
