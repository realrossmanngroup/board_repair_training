The board is immaculate, I've been over it several times and no signs of any corrosion at all, anywhere.\n\nSome readings:\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.58\nPPBUS_S5_HS_* - 8.58\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL - 18.19\nPPDCIN_G3H - 18.19\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.42\nPPVRTC_G3H - 3.33\nPP5V_S5 - 5.02\nPP5V_S4RS3 - 1.159\nPP5V_S0 - 0.00\nPP3V3_S5 - 3.33\nPP3V3_S4 - 0.00\nPP3V3_SUS - 3.33\nPP3V3_S3 - 3.33\nPP3V3_S0 - 3.33\nPP3V3_S4SW_SNS - 0.04\n\nPP5V_S4RS3 is the obvious one out here, but I can't find anything wrong on any components connected. Nothing that jumps out to me as a short to ground anywhere.\n\nAnyone able to give me a nudge in the right direction? Thank you!"}
