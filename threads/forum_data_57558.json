        "message":"I have this board, doesnt look liquid damaged, when i plugged in magsafe the fan doesnt cycle 3 times, but it turned on, loading apple logo and restart halfway, I suspect this is the bios and change it with mxic u6100 from 820-3023 (is this okay? Same size tho)..\nFan can cycle, sometimes 1 times sometimes two times, but it will turn on, chime, showing backlight, but before any logo popped up, it will restart and back to chime and backlight, and then restart again the process\nWhile poking around, I see that c7261 is shorted, resistance to ground os 3.5 ohm"
