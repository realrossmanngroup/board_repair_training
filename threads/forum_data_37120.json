            "message": "I dont have the schematics and boardview for this, can please someone send it to me?\n\nIt had a light water damage, around the wifi area and the lcd connector, i cleaned it and it powers on but there is only backlight no picture.\n\nThe water damage was pretty small area.\n\nI got a usb-c hdmi adapter and there is picture on the tv, though it wont boot to osx but the emergency? menu, where it say it could not boot, maybe i forget my password.... anyway i think that part is just osx reinstall, the trackpad and keyboard works and i can connect to the wifi (in that limited menu, maybe i will try to boot from usb enclosure later). so the only issue is the that is no picture on the screen. I suspect it needs new lcd, but what can i check before i order it?  (lcd connector had bit water on it, i cleaned it and looks good now, even on the board, i dont see corrosion, i see a bit around the wifi area on both side, but very small corrosion)"
