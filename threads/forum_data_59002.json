Cleaned the corrosion and board powers on w\/charger, but will restart after a few moments on the login screen and will not power on w\/battery at all.\n\nBefore I start poking around at rails in the affected area, would this strange behaviour correspond to a specific rail or power distruption? Since the machine fully turns on and then fully turns off, how could I measure a faulty line? Unless the machine decides to turn itself off after x seconds of improper voltage on a certain line.\nAnyway, glad to hear your thoughts!"}
