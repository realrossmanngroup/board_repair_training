        "message":"I'm working on a pesky 820-3437 that had light liquid damage near the SMC. Replaced the nasty resistors\/caps (isolated to the 3v42 areas near top of SMC), and got green light, but no fan. Tracked backwards and found that SMC_PM_G2_EN is pulsing quickly at low voltage (flipping from low-voltage to OL on multimeter quickly). My SMC_ONOFF_L is present (3.4v) and steady, but since SMC_PM_G2_EN was pulsing, I replaced the SMC, but no change. Still pulsing. I replaced U7501 and Q7520 just to make sure it wasn't causing issues, and no change--still pulsing SMC_PM_G2_EN.\n\nI also have fluctuating\/pulsing readings for rails further down, but it all starts back at SMC_PM_G2_EN. \n\nNot sure how to proceed; any ideas? Thanks!"
