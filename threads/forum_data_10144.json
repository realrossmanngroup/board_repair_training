        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",

        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on.."

Replaced the nasty resistors/caps (isolated to the 3v42 areas near top of SMC), and got green light, but no fan. Tracked backwards and found that <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> is pulsing quickly at low voltage (flipping from low-voltage to OL on multimeter quickly). My <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> is present (3.4v) and steady, but since <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> was pulsing, I replaced the SMC, but no change. Still pulsing. I replaced <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR> just to make sure it wasn't causing issues, and no change--still pulsing <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL>.\n\nI also have fluctuating/pulsing readings for rails further down, but it all starts back at <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL>. \n\nNot sure how to proceed; any ideas? Thanks!"
