This goes on forever.\nAccording to Apple's support site this indicates a RAM issue or RAM not being detected by the Mac.\nHave tried swapping out the RAM but no luck.\n\nThe initial repair I did was replacing <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> and the components surrounding it and rebuilt alot of the tracks around that area. I think this area may have had liquid damage or the charger used was a knock off one.\n\nAny help appreciated. Thanks"
