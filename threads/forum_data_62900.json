I've tried with the old screen (broken display but full working), and now it also dosen't have backlight with the old display.\n\nIt boots to the loading bar with normal backlight, but after a while, before the bar full loads, and just before the login screen appears, the backlight decreases.\n\nProbably something went wrong on the replacement, but I can't see nothing damaged.\n\nCan you help?"
