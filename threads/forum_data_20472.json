One of the resistor is <RESISTOR>R7225</RESISTOR> which has a hole in the board on pin 1 (<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_CPUVR_VDD</SIGNAL>). This is actually not a resistor I can replace it just shows two solder points. The resistor is 0 ohm, can i just jumpwire this or how to go about? Attached an image for reference with the location."

Dead CPU is of course very likely before you put any more time into this.\n<RESISTOR>R7225</RESISTOR> is no stuff on diagram, so it is probably not there. If <RESISTOR>R7224</RESISTOR> is present then <RESISTOR>R7225</RESISTOR> will of course not be there!"
