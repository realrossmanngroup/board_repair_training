            "message": "I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that had extremely light liquid to the top edge of the board (near <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>), and had no green light. Had a short on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, which ended up being the SMC (awesome). Replaced SMC, and got rid of the short, and got a green light, but no fan. Proceeded to check my rails, and found <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> was only 1.28v. Hmmm. No obvious short on the line. Checked all caps on that rail and none appear to be shorted, and all look great. and replaced <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> twice (with new/good chips), and no change. Cleaned the board well in the UC, and no change. All resistors along the circuit measure out well. The only other thing I can think of (and hope isn't the case) is a dead CPU/PCH, which is pulling down my vrtc line. Any way to confirm this? CPU/PCH does not get warm at all, of course.\n\nI'd assumed vrtc is always present, but maybe something is missing prior to even <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> being pulled up? Thank you for any assistance in advance."
