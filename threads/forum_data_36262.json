Only on the pads of r4808 and pin 1 on j4800 is it showing 1.8v while trackpad is connected.\nYou mentioned bad trace. Does that mean that the circuit leading to the pads on r4808 are bad?\nAnd if that's the case how does one fix this? Am I supposed to run a jumper from closest 3v3_s4?\nThank you for the help"
