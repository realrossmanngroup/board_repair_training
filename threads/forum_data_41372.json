The actual chip on the logic board is SiC635 but I can't find the datasheet for it and this one seems functionally the same. If I understand it correctly, the SiC chip (<CHIP>U7410</CHIP> etc) needs communication from the controller (<CHIP>U7100</CHIP>) on the PWM pin. The signal tells it how and when to switch the built in mosfets. When I measure the voltage on the PWM pin of <CHIP>U7410</CHIP> (pin1) I get 2.59V and it's just a straight DC signal. I double checked with the scope to see if there was a PWM signal and it's just a DC voltage.\n\nI replaced <CHIP>U7410</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7420</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> but it still has the exact same symptoms. I also checked that there is continuity between pin1 of <CHIP>U7410</CHIP> and pin 25 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>. So my guess is that the 2.59V I'm reading on pin 1 <CHIP>U7410</CHIP> is a result of the chip being put in tri-state mode by <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>.
