After taking the board out - the only place I found any corrosion was around the battery connector which I go through in detail below:\n\nBasically the Macbook would not turn on at all, I found corrosion around the '5-pin' battery connector at J100 (which connects from the battery pack to the battery PCB). A short obviously occurred in this area and the connector itself was damaged. I desoldered it and then ran some jumper wires back to the battery PCB. I also had to remove the connectors which connect the battery PCB to the logic board due to corrosion - and then run some jumper wires (all these jumper wires can be seem in the attached image).\n\nThe Macbook is now working and the battery is at 74% however it shows the battery as 'replace now' and 'not charging'. When I try and turn it on with the charger unplugged, it shows the flashing 'battery dead' symbol. Also, if I unplug the charger while it is on, it remains on for about 1 second, then turns off. However, when I plug the charger back in, the Macbook comes back to life as it were in sleep mode (i.e. it doesn't need to boot up into MacOS again).\n\nI am wondering if this might be an issue with the battery itself or with something on the logic board.\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"30%\"]56211._xfImport[\/ATTACH]"}
