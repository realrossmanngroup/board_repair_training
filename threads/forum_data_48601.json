        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
