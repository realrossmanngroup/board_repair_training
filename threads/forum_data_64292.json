I have different measurements.\n\nShe already pulled 0.260a, turned the cooler, but it didn't turn on. most of the time it pulls 0.020a and without a cooler.\n\nMeasurements change frequently. When I had 3.3v on PPVRTC_G3H, PP3v3_SUS was 0.\n\nAt other times, I have 2.8v on PPVRTC_G3H, PP3v3_SUS and PP3v3_S5.\n\nRTC_RESET_L - 3.26V\nPCH_INTRUDER_L - 3v or 2.8v(it was 1.5v, I replaced it with a 100k resistor)\nPCH_INTVRMEN - 2.5v\nPCH_DSWVRMEN - 2.4v\nPCH_SRTCRST_L - 3.26V\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.6v\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.4v\nPP5V_S5 - 5v\n\nPM_BATLOW_L - 0\nPLT_RESET_L - 0\n\nI'm thinking it's PCH!\n\nAny tips?"
