So I don\u2019t really get what you said,\n\nyou mean I should replace the nand chips.\nand how do I do the second boot device( boot from a flash ?)\n[\/QUOTE]\nYeah this is exactly why I stayed away from the A1 laptops. I bought a 2020 MacBook Pro used for $700 with the bottom bezel on the screen broken that I'm going to fix eventually but for now works all because it has cosmetic damage. And yes, I think it's one of the NAND chips or the A1 processor. Get Mac OS installed on a USB boot drive, or Linux (I recommend Mint Linux) and see if you can boot. Chances are you can't because nobody else supports the A1 chip like Apple wants, and they're trying to reclaim the Mac market share again by kicking Intel to the curb when they're done with them (again) but people like us remember. So you're either going to have to diagnose a chip fault, boot failure, RAM failure, or any other number of possible failures.\n\nMY BET! If it's the A1, they've locked out the security enclave and detected you swapped the screen. Now it's trying to lock you out for not being Apple certified repair. But that's just my guess from working on the days of when we swapped the fucking thumb button and it would stop reading finger prints and give you errors. Same shit different day."
