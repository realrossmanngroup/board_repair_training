Pin 1 for BKLT gives me 0v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> voltages:\nPin 4: 12.56v\nPin 3: 12.46v\nPins 1/2/5/6: 0.05v\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is a steady 3.4v\n\n<RESISTOR>R7701</RESISTOR>/02 have the proper resistance measurements\n<RESISTOR>R7742</RESISTOR> has 0v on both sides so I think that may be an issue."
