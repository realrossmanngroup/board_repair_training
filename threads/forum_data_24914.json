        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",

        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

            "message": "This was submitted as a liquid-damaged board although I'm not seeing any signs of it. I've attached pre-cleaning pics. It's cycling <SIGNAL>5V_S4</SIGNAL> along with <SIGNAL>5V_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> and every other voltage I can think to measure every few seconds. Nothing on Vcore. Vcore is measuring a short of 0.001 (1.1Ω) Is it more hopeful with a Vcore short if <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> wasn't shorted? (so the CPU didn't necessarily get hit with 12V) Either way, any tips for how to progress with this?"
