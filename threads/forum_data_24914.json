I've attached pre-cleaning pics. It's cycling 5V_S4 along with 5V_S0, ALL_SYS_PWRGD and every other voltage I can think to measure every few seconds. Nothing on Vcore. Vcore is measuring a short of 0.001 (1.1\u03a9) Is it more hopeful with a Vcore short if PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS wasn't shorted? (so the CPU didn't necessarily get hit with 12V) Either way, any tips for how to progress with this?"}

Did you check around U7400, R7402\/03?"}
