Are there any substitutes?\nAnd can I just remove it with hot air? was a bit concerned since it was next to cpu\n\nScrew hole next to the cap had the wrong screw in it, but it wasnt screwed down and doesnt look like they penetrated the copper layer. in some areas the solder mask is still intact\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"60%\"]17881._xfImport[\/ATTACH]"
