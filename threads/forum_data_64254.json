It has 5v on all 3 type c ports so opened it up to check and saw this chip on the board was destroyed alongside missing alot of the resistors. \nSo the first question is what does it do and can it be replaced?"}

Are there any other boards that have the same one other than the 14\" and 16\"? Otherwise i gotta think as to what i need to do with this machine"}
