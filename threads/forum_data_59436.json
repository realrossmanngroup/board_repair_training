    "definitions": {
        "820-3209": "What is 820-3209? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7600": "What is U7600? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PM_BATLOW": "What is PM_BATLOW? PM_BATLOW is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on.",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "CHGR_PHASE": "What is CHGR_PHASE? CHGR_PHASE is charger voltage chopped up into individual slices prior to smoothing where it becomes PPBUS_G3H.",
        "PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG": "What is PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG? This is battery power that flows to the system AFTER it has gone through a current sense resistor, before it goes through a fuse to become PPBUS_G3H power rail. .",
        "PPVCORE_S0_AXG_R": "What is PPVCORE_S0_AXG_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPDDR_S3_REG_R": "What is PPDDR_S3_REG_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU_PH1": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU_PH1? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW": "What is PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVIN_SW_TBTBST": "What is PPVIN_SW_TBTBST? a SIGNAL.",
        "P3V3S5_LL": "What is P3V3S5_LL? a SIGNAL.",
        "P5VS3_LL": "What is P5VS3_LL? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_REG_R": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_REG_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "CPUIMVP_PHASE1": "What is CPUIMVP_PHASE1? a SIGNAL.",
