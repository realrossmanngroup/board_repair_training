The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",

(can feel now taptic is clicking.)\ni did some voltage testing everything is normal excepts on <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SUS</SIGNAL> is missing did also diode testing is not shorted. \nalso tried replace <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> from donor board (same board model number)\nbtw:measured also <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SUS</SIGNAL> before i tooked <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> from this donor board is present.\n\nkinda no idea whats the next step. \nTIA"
