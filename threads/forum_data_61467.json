        "message":"Hello everyone.\n   Got this laptop yesterday, castomer says \"mac doesn't charging and external usb drives can not be recognized\"\nMac still powers on, everything works, exept usb-c potrs. With plugged in charger usb-c meter shows 5 volt steady on one of the ports, and 5 volt rebooting every 2 seconds on other port. No traces of liquid or corrosion on board.\n   I found out that PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO is shorted. After changing U3200 (CD3217) both ports has stable 5 volts with no rebooting. Then i changed U2980. Now Im getting 20 volts, 0.05 amps, board not booting, PPBUS_G3H 12.2, SLPS2R\/AWAKE signals present, PP3V3_S5 missing.\n   With battery mac still turns on, and external devices can be recognized now. But still not charging.\n\nChanged U7000, Q7030\/40, checked all resistors around u7000 and both CD3217, they are all fine.\n\nI'd appreciate any advice"
