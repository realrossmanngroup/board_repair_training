Or VSA, VSB, VSC, VSD all need to be good ?\nI assume VSx stands for Voltage Sense, and PGx stands for Power Good, so I'd expect PGD to turn on if VSD is good, but maybe there's additional logic that requires other voltage sense to also be good so that power rails turn on in sequence ?\n\nWhat about the STANDBY# pin of U7800 ? Can it have an effect on PMIC_EN_P3V3S5 ?"}
