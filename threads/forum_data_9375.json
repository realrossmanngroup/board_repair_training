Found the board had a shorted <TRANSISTOR>Q7320</TRANSISTOR>. Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7320</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7321</TRANSISTOR>, and the short is now gone and I have a good 8.56v on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, but I'm missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL>. <SIGNAL>PM_DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is present, but <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> and all my sustain signals are not present. No shorts found. <CHIP>U8020</CHIP> is covered in that protective conformal coating, and I didn't try replacing it yet, but if worth a try I will. I just figured since the liquid went near the CPU and shorted that MOSFET, that my CPU may be toast.\n\nShould I waste any more time on this?"
