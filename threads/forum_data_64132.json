            "message": "Got this board here completely dead with a little corrosion around <CAPACITOR>C5010</CAPACITOR>, which mad the trace between it and the pad passing through SMC to evaporate. I ran a wire to rebuild the trace and now the board has green light but only quarter fan and dies, no loop, just a single spin and dies until I remove power and reconnect and it does the same. Already verified classic sensors such as battery sensing circuit, <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>(even replaced it because diode mode on some pins were a bit strange and normalized after replacing) and verified PBUS sensors which are classic on this board to die too. Still no luck. Any ideas?"
