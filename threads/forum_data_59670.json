Under the microscope, I confirmed no liquid\/physical damage. This unit died on its own. Under further inspection, I found a short on PPVCC_S0_CPU. When I inject 1V to this shorted line the PCH on the CPU heats up. So I know that the CPU\/PCH BGA processor needs to be desoldered to see if the short goes away or is overlooked or if the short may be inside the PCB. If the short goes away after desoldering the CPU\/PCH then I will know that if I install a good CPU\/PCH then this Logic Board has the potential of working again to recover the data.\n\nMy main goal here is data recovery. I know this Logic Board is garbage however, I need to know if I am taking the right steps to recover the data potentially? Is there any other way to recover this data with another way besides replacing the CPU\/PCH?"}
