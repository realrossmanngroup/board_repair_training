The board was fucked up further by an idiot with a soldering iron.\nGot the board working, reassembled the MacBook and did a clean install.

No sighns of corrosion any closer to the SMC than edge bonding.\nIt was working, now it don't.\n\nTraces re-soldered:\nSMC_TMS from R5177 to SMC\nSMC_TDO from R5178 to SMC\nSMC_INT_L from R5193"}
