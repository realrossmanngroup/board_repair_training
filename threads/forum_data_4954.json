The board was fucked up further by an idiot with a soldering iron.\nGot the board working, reassembled the MacBook and did a clean install. SMC reset the machine and now does not power again.\nTried another trackpad and keyboard but still no power on. No sighns of corrosion any closer to the SMC than edge bonding.\nIt was working, now it don't.\n\nTraces re-soldered:\n<SIGNAL>SMC_TMS</SIGNAL> from <RESISTOR>R5177</RESISTOR> to SMC\n<SIGNAL>SMC_TDO</SIGNAL> from <RESISTOR>R5178</RESISTOR> to SMC\n<SIGNAL>SMC_INT_L</SIGNAL> from <RESISTOR>R5193</RESISTOR>"
