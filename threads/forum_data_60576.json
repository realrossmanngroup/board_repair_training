This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",

The backlight flickers and turns off, or stays on. <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN_R</SIGNAL> is 3.3V  and <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL> is 11V when computer is turned off but when I turn the machine on <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL> goes to 7-8V and stays, even if I close the screen down. Does this mean <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> is toast. The backlight will randomly go out, then come back on, then stay off. Can't say I have ran into this issue much."
