        "message":"On the bench I have an 820-00138 that has a strange issue. The backlight flickers and turns off, or stays on. BKLT_EN_R is 3.3V  and BKLT_EN_L is 11V when computer is turned off but when I turn the machine on BKLT_EN_L goes to 7-8V and stays, even if I close the screen down. Does this mean U7701 is toast. The backlight will randomly go out, then come back on, then stay off. Can't say I have ran into this issue much."
