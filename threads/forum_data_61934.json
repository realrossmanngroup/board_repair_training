        "message":"Hi,\n\nThis board has no signs of liquid damage. \n\nCharger was stuck at 5V 0amp. I had no PP3V3_G3H, found C7078 was bad,  replaced it and now I have PP3V3_G3H again. Only it's stuck around 2.1V. \n\nI removed R6999 (and replaced, just to be sure), and I have 3.3V on pin 1, so there shouldn't be an issue with my U6990 I think? I figured it was U7000 (ISL9232), replaced it, but  the problem remains the same. I do have 5V 0.05a on the charger at this point. So now I'm running in circles, I can't seem to figure out why I have this drop on PP3V3_G3H.\n\nDiode mode reading (red on ground) on PP3V3_G3H is 0.384. This is with R6999 back on the board.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is at 0.2V if that is any hint. Thank you in advance!"
