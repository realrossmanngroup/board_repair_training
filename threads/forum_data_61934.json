I had no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>, found <CAPACITOR>C7078</CAPACITOR> was bad,  replaced it and now I have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> again. Only it's stuck around 2.1V. \n\nI removed <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> (and replaced, just to be sure), and I have 3.3V on pin 1, so there shouldn't be an issue with my <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> I think? I figured it was <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> (<CHIP>ISL9232</CHIP>), replaced it, but  the problem remains the same. I do have 5V 0.05a on the charger at this point. So now I'm running in circles, I can't seem to figure out why I have this drop on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>.\n\nDiode mode reading (red on ground) on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is 0.384. This is with <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> back on the board.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is at 0.2V if that is any hint. Thank you in advance!"
