        "message":"Good evening 2informaticos,\n\nI dont have any 45W charger. Besides, I always use 85W for 15\" and 60W for 13\", and always the same chargers for all my mac.\n\nSince this is only the second logic board I'm working on, I've never tried to trigger anything directly on a board so far; \n\nSMC_ONOFF_L goes to U5110, but referring to the info available here : [URL]https:\/\/boards.rossmanngroup.com\/threads\/how-to-collection.60974\/[\/URL]\nI must solder a tiny wire on pin 1 of R5115, and then briefly touch the ground with the other side of the wire ? (Schematics, Page 39)\n\nSimultaneously, I must use both hands to check pulse at PM_PWRBTN_L, without any oscilloscope.\n\nWhat are we looking for there ? A defective keyboards\/power button ?\n\nI will update this post as soon as I can provide answers regarding SMC_ONOFF_L, PM_PWRBTN_L and PM_SLP_S4_L\n\nThank you for your help. Very much appreciated."
