This one was taking .026A so I traced it back to the SMC due to corrosion found in the area. I re-flowed the SMC and am now drawing .108A which means I assume I am missing <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>. its almost 4am but I do not want to go to sleep until I get this solved one way or the other. Would like some constructive suggestions."
