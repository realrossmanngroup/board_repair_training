If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

I replaced some caps and the board came back to life. Last week the costumer brought the machine back again with no VCORE. I replaced <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> as sometimes it's the culprit of that kind of problem and checked <RESISTOR>R7402</RESISTOR>. Same thing. Sometimes when I heat up <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> area VCORE comes back for a moment and dies again. I have 12.53V on Pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R7402</RESISTOR>, 0.54V on Pin 1 and 3.3V on Pin 2 of <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>, so I have enable signal and have VIN on <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>, but still no brain/vcore. What else can I look?"
