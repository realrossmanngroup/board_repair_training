I get 12.56v on ppbus_g3h with the battery unplugged.  Tried known good battery.\n3.17 ohms between pins 17 and 18 on U7000\n20.28 ohms between pins 27 and 28.\n\nwhen I connect the battery PPbus_G3h will read 12.56v for a few seconds, then drop to 11.6v for a few seconds, then repeat.\n\nThis one has me stumped."}

I don't really see how you could get 12.56V on PPBUS then. Disconnect battery indicator to rule out that is messing with the data bus. After that it could be the ISL or SMC"}
