            "message": "Hi guys i have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3476</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that runs off charger, orange and green light. As soon as I have the battery connected the light is off and PPBUS fluctuating between 8-4v. Did replace <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> just because its easy :P but that didnt fix it ofcourse.Im pretty bad fixing battery related issues, some guidance would be helpful. I did see some melted solder balls around <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> as well as <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR> but have not replaced those yet. Should I just replace them or is there a way to make sure these are OK?"
