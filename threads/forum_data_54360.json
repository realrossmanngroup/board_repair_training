Original issue was no power, which i resolved by replacing U7000. Then the left speaker wasn't working, replace U6400 and left speak works now. Finally, when headphones are connected, no audio is sent to the headphones, the audio remains on the laptops speakers. I've replaced the headphone jack will cable assembly, no effect. Any suggestions as to where to start on this?"}

So, i resoldered all the pins of J6600 and have full audio on the headphone jack. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. This is now fixed."}
