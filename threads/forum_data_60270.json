            "message": "I have a 3332 board that starts to boot normal but 10-20 seconds in it seems to semi-crash... not reboot but the screen goes black and external display (if any) quits. Still shows USB activity. I'm wondering if this is a GPU issue of some sort. I do get less than 1V on L3895 whether it looks to be booting or not. Also once it crashes or stops booting it doesn't seem to be able to stay running on battery power. If I let it sit for a while, it will boot off the battery initially or stay running with battery plugged in. After I've tried booting a couple of times it no longer shows backlight, display or any external display unless I let it sit for a while again.\n\nBasically at first boot, it appears everything is working temporarily but the display functions go away and ability to run off battery as well. I had switched the battery thinking it was bad, but then realized 2nd battery (I let it fully charge - light was orange for over hour or so and went green) it still has same problem"
