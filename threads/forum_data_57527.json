When connected to the charger, it shows 5v and 0.28a on all 4 ports. The board looks clean, with no signs of liquid damage or corrosion but someone ripped the keyboard connector and the right speaker connector off the board. Some of the pads for <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S_FAN_CONN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>GND_FAN</SIGNAL> were destroyed and <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground. Found that <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground inside the board right by the keyboard connector. I drilled a small hole in the board in this location and was able to clear the short, but it did not change anything. Still only getting 5v and 0.28a on all 4 ports. Can't find any other shorts.\n\nI replaced the keyboard connector and the flex cable and I tried to do the T2 firmware restore on this computer, but it does not seem to connect correctly. Every time I connect this computer to the the other working macbook (<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>), its comes up with a message in the top right corner of the screen that says \"Cannot Use Thunderbolt Accessory\". This error comes up no matter which port I connect it to. I did notice that when I connect the 2 macbooks together and connect the charger to this board, it show 20v and 0a instead, which I believe is DFU mode. The DFU icon never comes up in apple configurator though like it has for other macbooks I have fixed. Not sure if I have a <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> issue or not.
