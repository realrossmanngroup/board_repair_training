        "message":"Working on 3437, with a bit humidity!!  \n\nThis board initial it's working but without  image. i hear the post sound and the keyboard had a backlight.. \n\nAfter inspect the board i noticed R5177 + R5178 bought are corroded! i clean the pads and replace the components! But the problem remained. after a better check on board i found R7611 with a bit off corrusion and i noticed the pin 1 off R7611 not making a contact with the pad because the corrosion! The problem start here!! \n\nI clean the pads and replace R7611 but after that the machine when i plug the charger the fan only spin 1 time and stop!!! if i remove R7611 the fan always goes but don't work!!! \n\ni double check R7611 and R7612 bought have a certain values!! No short's! I noticed too when i remove the R7611 i have a unstable voltage on pin1 (2.6 - 2.8V). With R7611 i have 1.8V while the fan works! \n\nsuggestions ? thank you"
