            "message": "Working on 3437, with a bit humidity!!  \n\nThis board initial it's working but without  image. i hear the post sound and the keyboard had a backlight.. \n\nAfter inspect the board i noticed <RESISTOR>R5177</RESISTOR> + <RESISTOR>R5178</RESISTOR> bought are corroded! i clean the pads and replace the components! But the problem remained. after a better check on board i found <RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR> with a bit off corrusion and i noticed the pin 1 off <RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR> not making a contact with the pad because the corrosion! The problem start here!! \n\nI clean the pads and replace <RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR> but after that the machine when i plug the charger the fan only spin 1 time and stop!!! if i remove <RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR> the fan always goes but don't work!!! \n\ni double check <RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7612</RESISTOR> bought have a certain values!! No short's! I noticed too when i remove the <RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR> i have a unstable voltage on pin1 (2.6 - 2.8V). With <RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR> i have 1.8V while the fan works! \n\nsuggestions ? thank you"
