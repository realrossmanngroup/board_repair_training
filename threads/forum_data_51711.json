I'm a complete noob here.\n\nProblem: doesn't start. 3.42V and 11.89V present. Other voltages pulse when the power button is pushed.\n\nBoard is clean and no previous work has been done. Actually, I even managed to start it after pushing power button like 10x and it gave me one beep (RAM wasn't physically installed). \n\nAs far as I have researched, there are no leaked documents for Mac Minis?"}

It was just bare board.\nAs for the pulses, I believe pretty much everything pulses, including CPU coils."}
