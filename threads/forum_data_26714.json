The option to through this board in the thrush will not helps me understand more. To others the situation maybe it is not and I can fully understand.\n\nBack to my problem.\n\nAfter looking to the circuit around the <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>, I ve found the <TRANSISTOR>Q7403</TRANSISTOR> was short to GND. I ve replaced this one and <TRANSISTOR>Q7402</TRANSISTOR> and now the <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> is not hating anymore. \n\nBut still no image on screen.\n\nAfter doing some measurement I ve found that no <SIGNAL>PPBUS_SW_BKL</SIGNAL> is appearing on the <CAPACITOR>C9712</CAPACITOR>. This leaded me to look for where this has stopped. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR</SIGNAL> must be generated by the <TRANSISTOR>Q9806</TRANSISTOR> if <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_FUSED</SIGNAL> is present and the gate is low. After measuring <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_FUSED</SIGNAL> was present ~12V but the gate signal (<SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_DIV</SIGNAL>) was high ~10V. This is supposed to be ~4V.\n\n<SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_DIV</SIGNAL> to have that low value the FET <TRANSISTOR>Q9807</TRANSISTOR> need be activated by the presence of a high value of the <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL>. This signals is unfortunately coming from the MCP.\n\nAccording to my analyse above will this mean that this MCP has another problem then the original one?\nBecause before soldering it on the board I ve asured that the RTC cuircuit was not short to the GND by measuring.\n\nOr you guys you can see something else?"

I don't just want to get \"Bro\" solutions from this forum either. It does frustrate me when the people helping me are beating me down telling me that learning more in depth and experimenting/trying to come to a solution from beyond the normal level of repairs - Has less value than a trash can sitting next to me...\nKeep it up LaptopRepair, I hope you have success on this board.\n\nOn a side note, I do agree with a few thing said - All the MCPs that you can buy are pulled from another board. Why? Who knows... as Duke said, around 50% what you will receive will have an issue with them. There is an extremely high chance that the replacement you received is a bad one - and it might have failed/been failed in a way that could hurt other parts of the system.\n\nOnce again, good luck and keep sharpening the best tool there is! Your brain."

Its been YEARS since you could buy a MCP with some confidence it will work. \nTrust me we have tried.\nIf this was a backlight/usb/vcore problem there is some hope. But an issue like what your board has its truly hopeless. There is nothing to gain other than to learn when its time to stop."
