Most of the damage looked like it was around thunderbolt related stuff. Went through the ultrasonic, fired right up... no SSD detected. Tested the SSD externally on my iMac and it works fine.\n\nChecked <CHIP>U3740</CHIP>\nPin 1: 3.4V\nPin 2: 0.1v\nPin 3: 0.1v\nPin 4: 3.3v\nPin 5: Ground\nPin 6: 0.1v\nPin 7: 0v\nPin 8: 0v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_SSD_FLT</SIGNAL> I get 3.3v\n\n\nThings I replaced already... I started getting desperate.\n<CHIP>U3740</CHIP>\n<RESISTOR>R3741</RESISTOR>\n<RESISTOR>R3742</RESISTOR>\n<CAPACITOR>C3740</CAPACITOR>\n<CHIP>U3711</CHIP>\n<CHIP>U3710</CHIP>\n<CHIP>U8070</CHIP>\n\nBoth <SIGNAL>SSD_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SSD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> that are low appear to come from the CPU... which kind of worries me :(\n\nI'm not in front of the board anymore for the night but I will take any advice on where to go tomorrow."
