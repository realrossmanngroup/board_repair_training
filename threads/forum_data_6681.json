The computer chimes on startup and then when in the OS it will switch somewhat randomly between Internal Speakers, Digital Out and Headphones whenever you plug in and unplug headphones. Has anyone seen anything like this before? I find the audio switching circuit to be a maze so I'm not sure where this might be failing."}

I'm trying to follow where you're going, to realize the significance of this result, but I'm not there. I'm assuming this is to isolate whether it's the jack (or damaged jack circuit\/area) or the switching circuitry itself, but I'm not sure what this is telling me."}

Removing that resistor removes digital output in the switching process but should still switch between headphones and speakers. My guess is on the jack."}

If anyone has some basic concepts to share about the headphone circuit I would be greatly appreciative. I'm trying to figure out the paths but it's an absolutely confusing maze. Tips like the one above about removing R6805 to isolate the digital function go a long way to understanding the way this thing works."}

I could have speakers working, plug in headphones, they would work, unplug them, it says Digital Out. So I would lose speakers. But other times I could unplug the headphones and I would get speakers after. I cannot pick up a pattern and don't believe there is one.\n\nOnce I removed R6805 it stayed on Internal Speakers. Plugging in headphones changed nothing. I replaced the headphone jack again (from my boards, not purchased boards) and I'm getting the same thing. Let me know if you have any ideas. I just printed up those pages of the schematic and I'm going to try to sit and map this out. I need to understand this circuit."}

According to Louis's post above it should be switching between headphones and speakers with that removed. It's not doing that so apparently we're still having an issue with the switching."}

So appreciative. After seeing that pin 2 of Q6804 was off I went over to pin 5 and saw that it was lingering in a range around 1.7V. Checked R6802 and R6807 and found R6802 was open. Switched it out and we're back in business. Thanks again for working me through this."}
