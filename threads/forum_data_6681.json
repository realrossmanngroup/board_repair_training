The computer chimes on startup and then when in the OS it will switch somewhat randomly between Internal Speakers, Digital Out and Headphones whenever you plug in and unplug headphones. Has anyone seen anything like this before? I find the audio switching circuit to be a maze so I'm not sure where this might be failing."

I replaced the headphone jack again (from my boards, not purchased boards) and I'm getting the same thing. Let me know if you have any ideas.
