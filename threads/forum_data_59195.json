If it turns on, it would be totally fine, but if I leave it or if I press force shut down it would be unable to boot up again unless I unplug battery, unplug charger and connect again. Even then it would be intermittent.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 14 volts. Is this too high?\nI replaced the ISL, checked the Resistors R121/22/51/52, all checks out. Traces are good it seems. Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR>, but still getting 14 volts.\n\nI notice also when the computer does turn on, pins 5/6 of the BIOS is only 2 volts, is this normal?"
