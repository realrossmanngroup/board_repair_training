Voltage starts at .75V but drops to .54V after a few seconds on <SIGNAL>PPVDDCPU_AWAKE</SIGNAL>.\nBoard goes to 20v and drops to 19.95V drawing 1.4A but no USB activity or inclination that it is booting.\nResistance to ground at <SIGNAL>PPVDDCPU_AWAKE</SIGNAL> seems low compared to donor board I have: 4.5 ohms compared to 13.5 ohms but donor board quite possibly isn't a good reference.\nI cant get it into DFU Mode at all but because of that, I checked AWAKE and SLPS2R voltages and discovered what I think is incorrect with the PPVDDCPU line.\n\nVcore is at .975V. Thermal cam shows fair amount of heat at PCH. Power rails going show good values though."

            "message": "I don't have one to refer to but it looks like based on other threads it should stay at .75V. PUlling those components prevents the board from starting. It won't draw more than 5V. voltage readings on <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> side that circumstance is .3V. Just to see what would happen, I tried injecting .75V for the awake signal to see what would happen and it seems that it interferes with the commuications because the board just stays at 20V 0 Amps and won't then drop to just under 20V like normal.\n\nWith components back on and everything normal, board goes to 20V 0 amps then drops just under 20V and The USB drive light comes on for a few seconds board draws almost 2 amps and USB light shuts off then the board goes back to drawing 20V 0 amps, and lowers to just under 20V one more time draws 80 mA, and then just stays at 20V, 0 amps and doesn't change.\n\nWondering if the CPU is shorted. This board gets all the way through and sends <SIGNAL>PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL>. CPU goes to 95 degrees celsius in a few seconds when the voltage drop under 20. The heat sink is off. I know macs run hot but that has to be too hot, too fast, correct?"
