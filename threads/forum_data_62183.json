I have linked a video below from the thermal camera to show what is getting hot. The cpu is getting red hot, the first IC that appears to be hot is <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> and also L7210 is getting red hot. I'm not sure if <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> is bad, or if the cpu is bad and causing <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> to overheat or what the issue is. As I have looked over the board with the thermal camera and the CPU, <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> and L7210 stick out more than anything.  If I probe at L7210 I get 016.4ohm .\n[MEDIA=youtube]kh-<SIGNAL>P_5ZETMS</SIGNAL>[/MEDIA]"
