I have linked a video below from the thermal camera to show what is getting hot. The cpu is getting red hot, the first IC that appears to be hot is U7210 and also L7210 is getting red hot. I'm not sure if u7210 is bad, or if the cpu is bad and causing u7210 to overheat or what the issue is. As I have looked over the board with the thermal camera and the CPU, u7210 and L7210 stick out more than anything.  If I probe at L7210 I get 016.4ohm .\n[MEDIA=youtube]kh-p_5ZeTMs[\/MEDIA]"}
