Restarting equals high fans and keyboard backlight is off. Occasionally I could get it to start normal but not shut down and power back up afterward. If I shut down, the power button won't turn it back on. Can still do SMC Reset so power button is still working when it won't turn on. Plugging in without holding power button down acts like it is in SMC bypass as well. I tested holding down shift, control, option keys to see if light would change without power button but no, so it doesn't appear the power button is stuck on.\n\nTried reflowing then replacing SMC. Same symptoms."}

Replacing the SMC AGAIN oy fixed the high fan problem. As always... thanks for your help! pointing me toward the diagnostic and asking about the trackpad cable sent me down a road I wouldn't have guessed. I believe the trackpad cable was originally the only problem but having replaced the SMC I caused another either with a bad SMC or bad replacement job. *sigh*"}
