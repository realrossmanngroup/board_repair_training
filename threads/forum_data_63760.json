            "message": "Problem: Without battery any usb port pushes 20v  @.07mA then immediately drops to .05mA for about 20 seconds.  Reboots and repeats.  With battery, creeps up to 800mA and battery inductor \"lights up\" under thermal cam. Reboots after 20s again.\n\nI removed <CHIP>U4901</CHIP>, as it took a lot of damage. Still off the board for now. That's fine for now right? 20 seconds feels like a held down power button to me.  Like that's how long it takes to do an SMC reset right?\n\nAlso lifted and replaced plenty of caps around there, cleaned pads, traces good.  Found damaged caps around JB500, replaced, no shorts found on USB connector, or touchid connector.  DB505/501 took a hit, haven't messed with them.  They seem fine? I'll lift and check. Two TP pads near <CHIP>U4901</CHIP> have corroded away, <SIGNAL>PP17V0_MOJAVE_LDOIN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_MESA_SW</SIGNAL> specifically, no burning around them, no shorts on their lines.  Haven't found any shorts anywhere else.  I found the usual damage near the ssd controller <CHIP>U9080</CHIP> but it was surface seemingly, no shorts on inductors on either side, 2.5v when powered. I will be reballing immediately after this just in case."
