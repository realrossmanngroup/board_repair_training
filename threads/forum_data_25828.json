Shorts to ground on both of them. The other VCore rails are at their proper voltages. No obvious signs of liquid damage anywhere on the board. Because there are two separate VCore rails shorted to ground, my gut tells me the CPU is fried. But I'm a bit of a newbie, so I could easily be missing something obvious."}
