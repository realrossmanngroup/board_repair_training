        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "U7750": "What is U7750? a CHIP.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_EN_R_JERRY": "What is BKLT_EN_R_JERRY? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

When closed, no backlight!\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.42v or so when the machine is open, and 0-0.5v when the lid is closed. So if <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 0v, there are a few possibilities I will list in order of likelihood.\n\n1) J5250 area has corrosion on it, around <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> this is where lid sensor attaches that detects the magnet in the screen assembly to tell the machine it is closed. Remove and check.\n2) <RESISTOR>R5250</RESISTOR> is bad or corroded\n3) <RESISTOR>R5171</RESISTOR> is bad or corroded\n4) <TRANSISTOR>Q4801</TRANSISTOR> is bad(highly unlikely but happened once)\n5) You are measuring the machine closed, so it is giving 0v on <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> for good reason(please tell me you weren't doing this)."
