When closed, no backlight!\n\nSMC_LID is 3.42v or so when the machine is open, and 0-0.5v when the lid is closed. So if SMC_LID is 0v, there are a few possibilities I will list in order of likelihood.\n\n1) J5250 area has corrosion on it, around PP3V42_G3H this is where lid sensor attaches that detects the magnet in the screen assembly to tell the machine it is closed. Remove and check.\n2) R5250 is bad or corroded\n3) R5171 is bad or corroded\n4) Q4801 is bad(highly unlikely but happened once)\n5) You are measuring the machine closed, so it is giving 0v on SMC_LID for good reason(please tell me you weren't doing this)."}

Lid is of course open according to that Hall effects switch. However I did have a neo-d magnet that was next to it. It's for holding screws. I don't think I could replicate it again if I tried. Smc_lid is 3.42 now. (Palms face). R5250 and r5271 are fine... so 0v on p1 of LCD connector, smc_lid=3.42, q7706 p3:10.14, p4 10.5 and pin 5: 0v."}
