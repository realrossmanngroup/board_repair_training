        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",

I mean this thing is clean but has the usual dust and fuzz that most do have. i get a green/red light on the charger. noticed it is trying to do quarter fan spin. i can here the fan motor trying to turn over about every 3-5 seconds. i did some checking around with the multimeter and found that all of the s4 rails were pulsing from 0.347v to 3.3v. i also found that <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> is also pulsing the a same 0.347v to 3.3v. <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL> is also pulsing. \n\nnot sure where to go from here or if i should look somewhere else on the board first?\n\nany ideas?"
