Replaced a few damaged components around <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> fixed the power problem. Now no audio through speakers. Audio through headphone jack works. <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> had corrosion underneath it. Replaced <CHIP>U6400</CHIP>, problem persists. Can change volume, switches from headphones to internal speakers when headphones unplugged. \n\nI have traced everything I can think of following schematic and all components around <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> seem fine. \n\nDon't know where to go from here, any help is appreciated!"
