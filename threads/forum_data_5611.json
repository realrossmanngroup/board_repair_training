Do not have schematic so using and earlier model, but appear the same. Gets green and orang light, no fan spin. Some minor water damage.\nHit the U1950 area. Someone before me tried to replace U1950(Failed). I replaced it, Plugged it in and got fan spin. YEA!\nThen I reinstalled board and connected everything. Would not turn on. Took it back out, checked it all again. I am missing [FONT=Courier]PM S0 PGOOD, have [\/FONT][FONT=Courier]ALL_SYS_PWRGD[SIZE=9px] [SIZE=12px]and CPUVR_PGOOD\nAny, thoughts? Lost on this one.[\/SIZE][\/SIZE][\/FONT]\nCould the chip be bad?"}

So I tried to run a wire from the capacitor to the pin and replaced the U1950. Fans spun, then shut off and never turned back on. Not sure if its just the wire not connecting or what. There is only a small portion of the trace under the U1950 so I am guessing I am not getting a solid connection. Any thoughts on repair options?\n\nThanks G.Beard for the schematic! :D"}

Replaced u1950 and fans spin, put it back in the computer. It will power when plugged in. I can shut it off with power button, turn on with power button, but I get no boot, no screen, no keyboard caps lock. I know the track pad must be bad because it doesn't click. What could be keeping this thing from booting?\nThanks"}
