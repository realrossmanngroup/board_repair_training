With battery alone, it dosen\u00b4t power on at the firsts atempts  (even trigering SMC_ONOFF_L), but then, after a few starts with the charger, it starts to work normaly.\n\nSometimes it only powers on again, disconnecting the battery.\n\nI can\u00b4t see anything corroded, and i've already tried a know good battery.\n\nJ6950 w\/o battery connected:\nSMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL = 3.4V\nSMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA = 3.4V\nSYS_DETECT_L = 0V\n\nJ6950 with battery connected\nSMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL = 3.4V\nSMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA = 3.4V\nSYS_DETECT_L = 0V\n\nThe battery is recognized in macOS and is charging.\n\nCan you help?"
