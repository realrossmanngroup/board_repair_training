No damage visible - the machine is stuck at 5V on both ports. PPBUS is 12.31 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> is present. <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> and its associated enable is missing. Awake and Sleep voltages are also all missing. Not detected at all when I try to force DFU Mode. No visible shorts on any of the awake or sleep lines.\n\nStill very new at these boards but i've run through everything on the wiki but cannot see anything directly pointing to my issue other than possible dead <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>? Am I thinking along the right lines? Is there any good source for <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> or I just need to find dead boards?"
