There was a tiny amount of liquid damage around the mosfet Q43 and a 200k resistor R181. I was able to clean the corrosion off and replace R181, but still having the same issue? Any suggestions would be much appreciated, Here is a link to the schematic [URL=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B2UNwNtr3dVnVzV4NzZjbDlDSlE\/view?usp=sharing\"]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B2U...ew?usp=sharing[\/URL]"}
