            "message": "This is odd to me so I'm not understanding how the backlight in the display is designed. I have 69V at both pins 6 and 12 of J8200. I have image on the display but no backlight. I've checked for conductivity in the backlight cable that terminates at the bottom corners of the display and there is conductivity on all 12 pins. I've checked diode for FB pins on logic board and all are the same at 1.1. SOOO somehow there's voltage at bottom of display but no light? \n\nFrom what I know a power outage killed this Mac. there was a short to GPU on the logic board. I replaced that and now I'm discovering issue with display. The 4th LED status indicator is not lit. Is there something I could be missing related to the other LCD connector or something? I'm confused as to why there isn't backlight given my discoveries."
