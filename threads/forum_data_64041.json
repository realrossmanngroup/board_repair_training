        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "PP1V2_S3": "What is PP1V2_S3? PP1V2_S3 is a 1.2v power rail present when the machine is in an S3 suspend to RAM state.",
        "PP1V8_S3": "What is PP1V8_S3? The PP1V8_S3 signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides a voltage of 1.8 volts during the S3 power state. The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",
        "PCH_CLK32K_RTCX1": "What is PCH_CLK32K_RTCX1? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "AVREF_SMC": "What is AVREF_SMC? AVREF_SMC is a reference voltage provided to the SMC so that its sensors have a reference to work from, this should be 3.3v.",
        "PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC": "What is PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC? PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC Is a reference voltage for the SMC’s voltage sensors & other sensors..",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0."
