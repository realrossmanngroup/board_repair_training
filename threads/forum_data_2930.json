        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

            "message": "First post here, new to component level repair so feel free to dumb any answers down ;)\nThis machine has had some work done, not sure what but previously only working on external display. I found liquid damage around the <CHIP>U8000</CHIP> (looked like coffee, but maybe was flux) But I also found L9011 had been torn off the board, so replaced it and got an image on the internal. Cleaned the board and felt great as it all worked fine for a few hours, next day would not post. I found <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> all seem good but now has a dead short on <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>. No fan spin. Now I'm not sure what the best way to proceed is but hoping to learn (or move on if this is too stuffed)."

Is <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> present when you hit power?"
