It had liquid damage to only 2 components that I could see. C7671\/2 were both corroded so I replaced both of them.\n\nAfter plugging in the charger I keep getting a chime every few seconds and the machine keeps turning on and off. I can tell it is turning on and off because I can feel the trackpad when I click it while the machine is chiming. I tried unplugging the keyboard and trackpad but yet the issue remains.\nAlso, the board does get warm."}

When I feel around it seems like the entire board is getting slightly warm after about 30 seconds. I removed the CPU heatsink and felt the cpu and it gets warm but not extremely hot that would have me suspecting it."}
