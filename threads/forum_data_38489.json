It had liquid damage to only 2 components that I could see. <CAPACITOR>C7671</CAPACITOR>/2 were both corroded so I replaced both of them.\n\nAfter plugging in the charger I keep getting a chime every few seconds and the machine keeps turning on and off. I can tell it is turning on and off because I can feel the trackpad when I click it while the machine is chiming. I tried unplugging the keyboard and trackpad but yet the issue remains.\nAlso, the board does get warm."
