            "message": "I have the above board which had some water damage.  I've managed to get the board working and Mac OS loads fine. A lot of the liquid spilt onto the touch bar connector area especially J5100.\n\nI couldn't find a replacement touchbar in the UK for the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1989</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> but ordered one for the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> which I believe should be compatible (they both have the same connectors and ribbon cable reference numbers.\n\nWhen I attach the bar it lights up fine and I can adjust the settings fine from within system preferences>keyboard, however, it does not respond to touch.\n\nI noticed that pin 22 of j5100 had corroded and had a crack and literally fell off. Pin 22 on j5100 is called <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S_DFR_FILT</SIGNAL>.\n\nMy questions are is the fact that pin 22 is not connected the reason that the touch bar does not respond to touch or is it the fact that I'm using a touch bar from an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. Checking the pin outs for both logic boards in my eyes produces a match and considering visually the bar does what it's supposed to I'm thinking damaged pin 22 is the problem.\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\nThank you"

Yes the touchbars should be compatible between the 2 models. Your issue is the connection to <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> on J5100. Run a wire and it should fix it."
