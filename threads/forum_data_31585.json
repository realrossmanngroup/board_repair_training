        "message":"Hi Guys I have an 820-3662 that we repaired before, liquid damage. That time we fixed the SC-Card reader which was stopping the mac from booting, replaced a resistor and all was OK (also cleaned with ultrasonic cleaner). Now few month later both trackpad and keyboard dont work, mac boots to login screen. We tried all combinations of new KBD\/Trackpad nothing worked so assume its a logic board issue. HWT says there might be an issue with Mouse\/KBD\/Thunderbold. I checked the voltages on KBD and Mouse connector and all are present: 5V, 3.42v and 3.3v. Any idea what i should check more?\n\nEDIT:  WS_KBD_ONOFF_L = 3.3"
