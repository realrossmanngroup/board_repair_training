The hard drive thing seems like it could be a separate issue but maybe also related. IDK.  Where should I start to try to narrow it down? I have checked <CHIP>U7201</CHIP>. <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> drops when the fans do on AC power. All s3 rails drop. I have S5 rails steady. I just need a little direction. Thanks man."
