        "message":"A2141 came in taking 5v, 200-250 milliamps...\nI've taken some measurements and found PP3V3G3H_RTC reading a little lower than expected in diode mode.. I looked in the the thermal camera and found U6960 (PP3V3G3H_RTC VR) to be heating up.. I replaced it.\nBoard still taking 5v 200-250 milliamps.. I've taken another look into the thermal camera and found a USB-C controller (CD3217) one of them is heating up.. I replaced it..\nStill 5v 200-250 milliamps.. taken another look at the thermal cam and now it's T2 heating up\nI've put the board into its housing and put the computer in DFU and entered successfully, tried reviving the computer and its not showing any signs of life whatsoever.. giving me error \"4042\"\nIs there anything else I can look into it?\nCan it be a problem with the U7800 Calpe PMU? Can it be an issue with the T2 itself? I'm more than happy to troubleshoot it but never given the shot to dive deep.. I'm not sure on which rails should be present too.\n\nedit: one hint *might* help is that the trackpad does not click, usually when those computer in a certain state the trackpad clicks but does not show life.. this one does not show signs of life or clicking trackpad."
