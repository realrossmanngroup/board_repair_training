        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",

        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",

        "SMC_BATLOW_L": "What is SMC_BATLOW_L? SMC_BATLOW_L refers to a power management signal that indicates a low battery condition. The \"_L\" suffix suggests that this is an active-low signal, meaning that it becomes low when the battery reaches a low voltage threshold..",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",

        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "U5701": "What is U5701? this is the keyboard controller chip that takes the keyboard and trackpad input and turns it into a USB device signal for the machine to process. If replacing a keyboard doesn’t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
