No fan spin.\n\nPPBUS_G3H\n- with charger 16V (with or without battery)\n- without charger 6.5V (with flat batt), 7.1V (batt with 20% charge)\n\nIt won\u2019t charge when battery is flat.\nI connected battery with 20% and works fine, its charging battery as well but when battery is flat there is battery symbol on display.\n\nU7100\n17\/18 3.4 ohms\n27\/28 20 ohms (There was a few million ohms before. Duke suggested in other post to check trace between R7121\/22 and R7120 and there was not connected. Did jumper from pin 2 R7121 to pin 4 R7120 and pin 2 R7122 to pin 3 R7120).\n\nAny ideas?"}

This would indicate a shorted Q7130 or a bad ISL6259 or the traces to Q7130. Replace Q7130 and U7100 together as 1 may kill the other."}
