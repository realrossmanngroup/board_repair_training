            "message": "Hello everyone, I got a Macbook Pro <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3476</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) that was previously water damaged. Its running super slow. There isn't any corrosion on the logic board.  After running the ASD I noticed there was a problem with my camera sensor. I troubleshooted this circuit and found a short on <SIGNAL>CAM_SENSOR_WAKE</SIGNAL>. I have tried to remove most of the components in this line but i can't releive the short. Am I looking at the wrong place? I traced this line down to <SIGNAL>PP1V8_CAM</SIGNAL> and this line seems to be fine. If anyone can help out ; it will be greatly appreciated. Cheers!"

It needs to be replaced due to the corrosion. I have desolder J4002 to ensure there wasn't any corrosion underneath causing this problem but still the same thing. Duke can you enlighten me?"
