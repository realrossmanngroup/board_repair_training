        "A1398": "What is A1398? A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",

        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR": "What is PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR? PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR is PPBUS_G3H after it has passed through a backlight fuse and a transistor that allows power through when BKLT_PLT_RST_L and LCD_BKLT_EN are present. .",
