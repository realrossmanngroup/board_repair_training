I got a Mac a2141, with massive board damage by wine. PPBUS was shorted. Removed CA780, C9573, C9574. Short is gone, PPBUS is back to normal value.\n\nNow there is 20v on charging ports, 0.03 amps\n\nPPBUS 12.6V\nPP2V5_NAND_SSD0 2.5v\nPP1V8_G3S present\nPP5V_G3S present\nPP3V3_G3H_T present\n\nSLP2SR signals is present\nAWAKE signals is present\n\npp3v3_s5 is missing. Not shorted (0.33 in diode mode)\nChanged U7800 - no effect.\nTryed to restore with Apple Configurator in DFU - it ends up with an error\n\nThere was a bit of corrosion around U1200, just for case changed resistors R1530, R1511 and R1941 because it wasn't looks good.\nIs it possible that U1200 is damaged and pulling pp3v3_s5 to the ground? \nI don't have a stencil for that chip, so don't want to take it off the board for now..((("}
