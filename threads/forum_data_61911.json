Got this one from another store and who knows what have been done to it. <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> was bad and so were <CAPACITOR>C3508</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C3509</CAPACITOR> and board was obviously not negotiating 20V. When I plugged in charger it sucked 1.5Amps from charger and immediately shut down in loop. Replaced those components and now I get 20V on charger. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> is jumping up and down like hell and so is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. I get little pulsing on L8000 like if the board is trying to turn on. I have no shorts that I could find on big coils. Tried replacing <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> but no luck. Any hints?"

Gave a nice reflow on all <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> and board worked again. Working for 3 days now without a single issue. Will test it for some more time before giving it back to costumer."
