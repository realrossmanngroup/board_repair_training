            "message": "I'm working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that had liquid, and has no green light or signs of life *at all*. I'm missing <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> and even <SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_FUSE</SIGNAL> is 0v. There WAS liquid to the DC-In connector and pins 1 and 2 are corroded looking, but after scraping away a bit of corrosion and checking continuity through the connector, it seems fine. I ran a wire through the board to <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> just in case the through-hole was corroded, but no dice.\n\n1. No green light, no activity at all on charger. Board DOES power on from battery.\n2. Diode for J7000: 1: 1.89; 2: 1.89; 3: OL; 4: ground; 5: ground; 6: .588.\n3. 0V at F7005.\n\nI can't help but think I'm missing something obvious. I can pull the actual DC-In connector, but I don't think it's damaged enough to cause the charger to go into protection (I think is what's happening?). I don't detect any shorts on ppbus, 3v42, etc., but I don't think a short would prevent any voltage at all on the DC-In connector, right? Unless the short was on <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>, etc., but there isn't.\n\nI haven't checked much beyond the above because I don't think anything would matter this early in the circuit/power-on sequence. With 0v at F7005, I need to start here, correct?\n\nI feel like this will be an easy one, once I've figured it out (of course). All help appreciated!"

Didn't \"look\" too bad, but when I pulled it, there was a ~.25\" dried/hardened \"pool\" of delicious coca cola. Got it cleaned/replaced and green light returned.\n\nWill update thread in ~1 hour once I confirm board works, but initial issue is resolved."
