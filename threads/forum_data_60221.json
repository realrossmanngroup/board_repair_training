I will try.\nI also noticed that on internal display the image is ok, even with video playing; it starts to distort when I force dedicated GPU.\nWhen I look at the block diagram page 2, I understand that mini display port should also use internal and dedicated GPU, through <CHIP>U9390</CHIP> DP/T29 MUX. Why I don't have a clear image on external display then? Is it possible that this MUX is blocked to dedicated GPU?"
