I understand that they're worried about their files not getting deleted, but they're assuring me beforehand that the computer has been removed, and of course it hasn't, so I need to be able to check for iCloud locks before paying them. Let me know if you know of anyone in the U.S. that would be able to run checks, probably 5 or 6  times a week. I'm thinking I could pay them monthly or something like that. Or maybe for each check - whatever works."
