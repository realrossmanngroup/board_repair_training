Data already backed up before the issue started. \n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> was shorted and getting excessively hot. Removed <TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> but since it was welded to the board from the short replacing it is not possible.\n\nFans spin fast within couple minutes of power on. Previous shop ripped <TRANSISTOR>Q6000</TRANSISTOR>. Replaced and all traces are good however still fast fan. Resistors measure good.\n\nWhen trying to load os recovery the apple logo and progress bar will disappear within  a few minutes with the blinking question mark folder.\n\nDrive is visible when holding option. Windows section will crash within a few minutes. Mac os installer  goes to  question mark folder after the progress bar finishes.\n\nCustomer wants only mac os now. Changed bios as well but no change. Is this looking like bad SSD?"
