            "message": "Water damaged, no corrosion at all, battery shot. Someone worked on it previously for data recovery. Client claims it's not powering on. I/O cable broken at one end...\n\nkeyboard backlight on the logic board (J4915) shot/burned.\nConnector on the keyboard backlight sheet also burned.\n<SIGNAL>KBDLED_CATHODE2</SIGNAL> through hole burned.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_KBDBKLT</SIGNAL> was internally shorted so I decided to make a new route because this involved only 7 caps, <DIODE>D7720</DIODE> and feedback <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_BKLT_FB2</SIGNAL> to <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>.\n\nI restored <SIGNAL>KBDLED_CATHODE2</SIGNAL> through hole connexion.\nI replaced J4915 and got these diode mode values that look good to me:\n\n0.614 on Cathode 1 on pin 1\n0.613 on Cathode 2 on pin 2\n0.590 on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_KBDBKLT</SIGNAL> pin 3 and 4\n0.00 (gnd) on pin 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10\nOL (not connected) on pin 6\n\nProblem:\nEverything is working except keyboard backlight.\nWhen I boot during the progress Apple bar, when it switches and mouse pointer appears I can see one brief flash of keyboard backlight and then no more. As if there was no feedback after the first time keyboard backlight starts. Don't know though if it is supposed to stay on.\n\nDuring this process where the kbd bklt appears briefly I catch <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_KBDBKLT</SIGNAL> going from 5V to 35V and maybe more, Then it stays at 16V, witch is maybe not enough but is kind of boosting...\n<SIGNAL>BKLT_PWM_KEYB</SIGNAL> is 1.14V. When I use F6 key to higher the kbd bklt I can see on the screen the logo bar showing that it s going up. but still no backlit keyboard.\n\nI don't think it's a feedback issue, because when I disconnect it there is absolutely no boosting, <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_KBDBKLT</SIGNAL> stays at 4,88V and nomore backlight kbd briefly showing up.\n\nI checked values and continuity between <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> <RESISTOR>R7720</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7721</RESISTOR> (cathode 1 and 2) they measure 0 ohm, but schematics says 10.2ohms, same thing with good board I guess it's ok...\n<RESISTOR>R7747</RESISTOR> 0 ohm is also good for <SIGNAL>BKLT_PWM_KEYB</SIGNAL>.\nSCL and SDA 0 ohms resistors <RESISTOR>R7750</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7751</RESISTOR> are also measuring 0ohms.\n\nAny idea? I am thinking about J4915 but no way to make sure it is making contact with the backligh sheet pin connector replace <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>?"
