        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "PPVIN_S0_SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVIN_S0_SW_LCDBKLT? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

Connecting to an external monitor works and the blinking folder shows up on the external monitor.  F7700 has 8.57V on both sides but <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0_SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> at pin 1 of L7701 is 0V.  PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLTFET going to pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is 8.57V.   <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> at <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> is 0V.  <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> at <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> is 5.128V and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is 3.4V.\n\nI'm thinking that there may be a short to ground based on getting a small tingle while resting my arm on the chassis and taking a measurement.  The short might then be causing <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> to not turn on the display.  However, I can't find the short anywhere on the board.  Nothing is extremely hot.  Aside from measuring component to component, is there a good strategy for finding a short that would affect the display?\n\nSteve"
