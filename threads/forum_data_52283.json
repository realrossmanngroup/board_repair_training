        "message":"Got the board that's not booting up. It looks like it was clean, but I can find any signs of corrosion. When plugged to power, the fan spins (normal fan RPM when the board is installed in the frame).\n\nPM_PCH_SYS_PWROK is 3.4v\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 1.7\n\nReflashed EFI with clean file and also replaced EFI chip. Same outcome. \nInstalled EFI chip from another board to test and got the same outcome\n\nWhen the fan is unplugged, the cpu gets warm but never gets hot. \n\nAny suggestions?"
