I do believe the customer cleaned it up. He said he was \"looking at replacing the keyboard\", and \"accidentally touched metal on the board, shorting it out. Now it won't turn on\". So... sounds like the unit used to work until the customer fucked with it. \n\nI thank you for spoon feeding me in advance..."
