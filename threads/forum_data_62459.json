        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting.."

Battery lock up, but same case when using known good battery.\nwhen on only battery, ppbus is pulsing about 12v(can't get a good ready from osope) 2 short pulse within 1sec and 2/3 sec of no activity and loops.\n\nMeasure current sensing for ISL <RESISTOR>R7061</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7062</RESISTOR> and all is good, measured <SIGNAL>SMB_SMC_CHGR_SDA</SIGNAL> and SCL and i get normal communication with SMC(diode reading at 0.395)\nnot sure what else is wrong here"
