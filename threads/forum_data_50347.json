        "message":"I am working on a 820-4924-A \"I get to go to war with this one\" no time restrictions!\n\nthe PP5VS3_EN line is missing. So obviously PP5V_S3 is not turning on.\n\nThe PP5VS3_EN line is reading about 0.7V. I have seen this line shorted before so I checked resistance to ground it it was good. About 100k Ohms.\nI isolated U7501 pin 4 (EN) by moving R8179 off the pad and PP5V_S3 came on and there is 3.4V on pin 4. I now have 0 volts on the \"CPU\" side of R8179 which is PM_SLP_S4_L.\n\nThermal imaging shows heat in the processor area. Unit is pulling 130 mA. No other thermal hot spots that are out of the normal.\nI know that PM_SLP_S4_L comes out of the CPU directly. I get this sinking feeling that I am dealing with a bad CPU but am not confident.\n\nI am a little confused. the \"L\" means it should be low to enable? I really do not have a solid grasp on this circuit or the order of the S3 enable state. I would think the system would be trying to enter S3 just by giving it power. Then move on to S0 if the SMC is happy with what it sees. \n\nPlease give me hope :)"
