    "definitions": {
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "U8300": "What is U8300? a CHIP.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "EDP_PANEL_PWR": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S0SW_LCD": "What is PP3V3_S0SW_LCD? PP3V3_S0SW_LCD is a 3.3v power rail necessary to power the image circuitry on the screen. This is necessary to get a picture on the screen. .",
        "PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the backlight on the LCD screen, this is necessary to get the screen to light up..",

            "message": "Hi, I have an Air 3437 that came in with liquid damage, sometimes rebooting by itself but working. Some corrosion around <RESISTOR>R5100</RESISTOR>. Replaced <RESISTOR>R5100</RESISTOR> (<SIGNAL>RESET_L</SIGNAL>, maybe thats why it was rebooting sometimes), alsoY1915 had a tiny bit of corrosion under it, replaced it. I have orange and green light, the fan spins one time 12 seconds, reboots, and then keeps spinning high, no display. <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> area looks OK no shorts and all R measure OK. I also have 32 on clockchip.\n\nThe board seems to have all power lines, CPU got 1.75 and 1.5 and Dram power is also there. I also have <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>. Tried SMS reset and Bypass, reset did nothing, bypass gives me super high fanspin but no boot. Mouse has a light on USB and I also have <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL>. I have 0v on <SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> but both sides of the Fuse have 8.6v. Also missing is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL>, no shorts on <CHIP>U8300</CHIP>, 3.<SIGNAL>3V_5S</SIGNAL> is there but no <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL> which comes from PCH. I have <SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER_EN</SIGNAL> as well as <SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL> it seems SMC is running. Ideas?"
