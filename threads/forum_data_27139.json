Apple uses ASD2 for that which is not available for unauthorized stores :(\n\nSo like I said check the connector and <SIGNAL>WS_KBD</SIGNAL> signals. If thats all looking alright boot into something like Internet Recovery and see if you can use the shift key in there. Otherwise <CHIP>U4801</CHIP> might be damaged but this pretty much never happens"

I tried another keyboard and that had the same results. Usb keyboard works fine. after using the usb keyboard the rest of the keys started misbehaving, not showing the correct character or doing nothing. so i replaced <CHIP>U4801</CHIP>. After the replacement absolutely nothing has changed, so i have no idea how to proceed."
