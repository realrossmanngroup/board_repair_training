Apple uses ASD2 for that which is not available for unauthorized stores :(\n\nSo like I said check the connector and WS_KBD signals. If thats all looking alright boot into something like Internet Recovery and see if you can use the shift key in there. Otherwise U4801 might be damaged but this pretty much never happens"
