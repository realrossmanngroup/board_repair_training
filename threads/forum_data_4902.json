        "BATLOW_L": "What is BATLOW_L? This signal tells the system that the battery is low, when the signal is low. Anytime you see an “_L” after a signal, that means that the signal is present when it is a low voltage, typically 0 volts to 0.5 volts.",
        "U5000": "What is U5000? This is the System Management Controller(SMC) in macbooks from 2013-2015.",
        "U0500": "What is U0500? a CHIP.",
        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",

        "R1410": "What is R1410? a RESISTOR.",
        "C7050": "What is C7050? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for battery current sensing, you should measure around 2.202 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution.

This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

I'm not getting a <SIGNAL>BATLOW_L</SIGNAL> signal. The schematic says it goes from SCM (<CHIP>U5000</CHIP>) to PCH (<CHIP>U0500</CHIP>) with a pull up resistor in the middle.\n\nDoes it go like this?\n\n.........Resistor\n...............|\nSMC----------------PCH or SMC ------ Resistor ---- PCH\n\n[IMG]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/filedata/fetch?filedataid=418&type=thumb[/IMG]\n\nSo does the SMC short the signal to ground when the battery is low? I'm getting 3.3v from <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_PCH_GPIO</SIGNAL> on pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R1410</RESISTOR>, but nothing on the other side of it, so I'm not sure where I need to look for a short to ground.\n\nOn an unrelated note: On the battery connector J7050 I'm getting 12.3v on <CAPACITOR>C7050</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7060</CAPACITOR>, but then the voltage steadily drops to 4v and then jumps back to 12.3v. Bad cap? Or bad MOSFET? Should I be getting 12.6v or does 12.3v out of <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> mean something is bad?"
