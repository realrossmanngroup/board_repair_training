        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",

        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

After inspection  I found out:\n\n\n- small corrosion between <CAPACITOR>C7400</CAPACITOR> /<CAPACITOR>C7425</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C2951</CAPACITOR>/<CAPACITOR>C2952</CAPACITOR>\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> was completely shorted to ground, but it was caused by damaged <CHIP>U8000</CHIP> (no corrosion around). \n\nI've replaced caps and <CHIP>U8000</CHIP>. Now board is pulsing twice without fan spin and nothing other happens. All S0 rails are pulsing, including CPU and PCH VCORE.\n\nWhat I have done so far: \n\n- checked <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>/J6100 and all termination resistors \n- tried new SPI chip and known good BIOS with clean ME region\n- replaced <CHIP>U6101</CHIP> and <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>, area of <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> looks perfect\n- there are no broken/corroded traces or test points\n- checked current sensing resistors, even replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>\n- reballed and then repalced SMC (just in case)\n- SMC bypass gives me two short fan spins, then nothing. After pressing power button i get only one fan spin.\n\nIs it worth spending time and digging into this board or it's obvious behaviour for damaged of CPU/PCH?"
