Replaced <CAPACITOR>C6700</CAPACITOR> and what I believe is <CAPACITOR>C7234</CAPACITOR>. I don't have a boardview for this and not even sure if this is 01598 or 01958 board for sure as I can't find a F'ing part number anywhere. \n\nIt appears I have good voltages according to the power sequence chart I referenced up through  <SIGNAL>P3V3MAIN_PGOOD</SIGNAL>. I am not sure how to find <SIGNAL>P5VG3S_EN</SIGNAL> or <SIGNAL>PCHRTC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> as they don't seem to correspond to the 01521 boardview.\n\nBoard now takes 20V and eventually the wattage and amperage go to zero. If battery is plugged in the board cycles down to 5V and back to 20V every few seconds.\n\nI tried connecting to Configurator2 but the device does not showup on the host machine. I asked customer and believe the target device has Catalina and matched accordingly but I believe it should still see the device at least regardless.\n\nPlease help!"

I assume this means that the TOuch ID sent was not a pair for the board but wanted to see if it's possible that, because the battery is bad (waiting for replacement), if there are quirks to these new macs that would not allow things to be setup due to an existing fault somewhere else? I also ordered another audio board wondering if the original has also had enough liquid contact to fail and cause issue with Touch ID. Audio board was affected by the spill but doesn't visibly look like it would've failed.\n\nYour thoughts?"
