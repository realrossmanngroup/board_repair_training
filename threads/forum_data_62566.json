He said that first there was image issue when moving the screen, but he was able to use it with an external monitor. After that, he said that the laptop stopped powering on at all.\n\nWHAT WAS DONE : I disassembled the motherboard and spotted some corrosion around UB400 chip.\n\nSo I think in first place there was an issue with the flex from the screen, because it worked only in certain position - and I can fix it later if I manage to power it up ))\n\nMEASUREMENTS : \n\nI measured some pins on UB400 : \n\nPP1V8 LDO - 1.8v\nPP3V3 LDO - 3.3v\nPP1V1 LDO - 0v\nPP1V8 LDOA -1.8v\n<SIGNAL>USBC_TB_CC1</SIGNAL> - pulsing from 1V to 2V like a crazy\n\nAMP meter\n\non power it takes 20.41V from the wall and AMP go up to 0.8A and drops to 0.40A\n\nIs the UB400 - CD3215A dead ?\n\nYou'll find some pics around UB400 corrosion\n\nThank you for your support\n\nBest regards"
