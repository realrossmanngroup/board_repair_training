Schematic shows diode here so I expect to see .6 ish v drop.\n\nNot sure is maybe I messed up <TRANSISTOR>Q9560</TRANSISTOR> but can see how it would prevent turn on if no short present.\n\nI was careful to no allow mush heat near CPU, however its likely some flux/alcohol got under it, I applied a slight amount of heat so flow/dry anything under CPU but no where near enough to reflow the CPU.\n\nAny Idea's?\n\nBTW - Have been watching your utube vid's, great stuff, thanks\n\nBruce"
