        "820-3208A": "What is 820-3208A? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D6905": "What is D6905? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input on very old Macbooks(before 2011), can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",

        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."

Seems to have got everywhere and although it was non-conductive paint, the board had serious damage around the <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> area on both sides of the board.  the stop mask has evaporated in a number of places; but I have rebuilt the whole of that area from <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> to the voltage divider feeding <CHIP>U6990</CHIP>.\n\nalso blown was <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> and <CHIP>U3890</CHIP> was very crispy.  stop mask stripped from underneath.  <CHIP>U9410</CHIP> area nasty too.  Replaced <CHIP>U9410</CHIP>, <CHIP>U3890</CHIP>, <DIODE>D6905</DIODE>.\n\ngreen light on charger now.  But only 2.5v on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>.  resistance to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is 83ohm.  diode mode shows 4mv to L6995.  \n\n1.5v on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. and <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is being kept low.   <CHIP>U5010</CHIP> replaced just in case. \n\nvoltage injected on pp4v42 at <CAPACITOR>C6992</CAPACITOR>.  incrementally pushed it up to 5v with no excessive current use (10mA) and no heat at all on the board.\n\nany suggestions for this one would be welcome.\n\nthanks\nJustin"

I've removed all the paint from the board and lifted and cleaned all the components with trace of paint on them apart from the usb as thunderbolt ports. Not sure how to remove them cleanly so I've just cleaned them with a toothbrush as best I can."

Re the voltage on 3v42 - injecting 3.42v showed very low current draw and no heat in any of the circuits.  If there was a short (and it's measuring 83 Ohm whereas on other boards the 3v42 to ground is much higher, so there would seem to be something amiss,  then how would you recommend chasing down the short without increasing voltage and seeing what got hot?"
