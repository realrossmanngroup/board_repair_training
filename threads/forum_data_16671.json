They said their customer had this fixed by someone in Hong Kong about 18 Months ago. It turns on but runs slow, the fans spin high and the system is being used at 88%. I ran ASD for this and I got an error on the Th1h sensor and this is what the hardware profile page showed.\n\nTh1H Fin stack Error- SMC IO failed\nreaing -124C\nlow-limit: 10C\nHigh: 80C\nFin Stack Temp\n\nInspecting the board I see some very tiny spots of blue corrosion. I also saw a couple discolored points on the right side of the SMC but nothing much. I read through and followed this post from another similar issue but I still haven't been able to fix this.

It will show close to 0v and every second or so it will very rapidly pulse and show something like 0.21v, 0.35v, 1.7v. I wasn't sure what could be pulling CPUTHMSNS_ALERT_L down so I replaced U5511 but it still does the same thing.\n\nMy last resort was going to be to remove the edge bonding from the SMC and put some heat and flux under there."}

Now I get 3.3v on the VDD pin but when I tested in ASD it failed with the same reading.\n\nPin 1 of C5511 is fluctuating rapidly from 2.5v to around 3v and Pin 2 goes from 0.37v to 0.64v. Pin 1 of C5512 goes from 0.78v to 1.1v and Pin 2 is 0v. \n\nI have a working 820-3115 board and it meaasured around 0.85v on Pin 2 so I'm not sure if there is an issue with Q5515 or the donor board that I replaced U5511 with was already bad."}
