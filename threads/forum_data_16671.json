            "message": "I got this board sent in from another shop. They said their customer had this fixed by someone in Hong Kong about 18 Months ago. It turns on but runs slow, the fans spin high and the system is being used at 88%. I ran ASD for this and I got an error on the Th1h sensor and this is what the hardware profile page showed.\n\nTh1H Fin stack Error- SMC IO failed\nreaing -124C\nlow-limit: 10C\nHigh: 80C\nFin Stack Temp\n\nInspecting the board I see some very tiny spots of blue corrosion. I also saw a couple discolored points on the right side of the SMC but nothing much. I read through and followed this post from another similar issue but I still haven't been able to fix this.

It will show close to 0v and every second or so it will very rapidly pulse and show something like 0.21v, 0.35v, 1.7v. I wasn't sure what could be pulling <SIGNAL>CPUTHMSNS_ALERT_L</SIGNAL> down so I replaced <CHIP>U5511</CHIP> but it still does the same thing.\n\nMy last resort was going to be to remove the edge bonding from the SMC and put some heat and flux under there."
