        "message":"[COLOR=rgb(147, 101, 184)]Unfortunately [\/COLOR]to hopefully provide all crucial data I have to quickly run it from the beginning :sleep: (I'll try and give only highlights):\n                               Came in from other shop for \"only booting in safe mode\" with a fresh install of Big Sur. I confirmed this issue with my eyes several times, tried a repair install which didn't happen because it struggled to boot to any bootable installer\/OS; I [COLOR=rgb(84, 172, 210)]set the computer aside[\/COLOR] for a day or two before getting to it.  When I got to it- [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]lo [\/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(243, 121, 52)]and [\/COLOR][COLOR=rgb(41, 105, 176)]behold[\/COLOR][COLOR=#000000]: it magically worked properly, no issues at all; Big Sur in all its glory. It continued to work for about a week; turned it on and off and played YouTube etc. every day. After some failed SuperDuper clones from an older computer they wanted the clone from, we restore from a  Time Machine backup of that older computer via Migration Assistant to a working fresh Catalina install. After restore back to only booting in safe mode. This time able to go to recovery and Catalina is available- repair install\/data restore = SUCCESS ;) WELP let's go to Big Sur! It ran through a \"critical update\" for like two minutes then went back to normal update. It got too late, left it alone after restart initialized, plugged in, updating. Came back in the morning. [\/COLOR][FONT=courier new][COLOR=rgb(0, 0, 0)][I]Now its worse. [\/I][\/COLOR][\/FONT][FONT=arial][COLOR=#000000]Now its a combination of, spazzes out chiming repeatedly for a lot of times then shuts off or it goes to load the apple then loops or just stays black; chiming every time. Not able to select a boot device, no recovery, no Diagnostics. I tried plugging in an external monitor because something I read on another post while making sure I'm not posting something that's already been posted here. I tried with\/without battery, with\/without power plugged in. It does except SMC and PRAM resets on the times that it\u2019s not just \u201cspazzing out,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t fix anything. Google\/YouTube no help. I've repeatedly looked over the board under the microscope hoping to see something obvious, nothing catches my eye. I suspect EFI chip? But I'm aware I could be way off. I don't really know where to start poking around with the multimeter on this one or if its necessary. \n                               \n[I]                                             I hope that's not too long and explains the issue clearly.[\/I] I've never been a forum member anywhere I normally just read them, why? idk who cares. If there's anything I could do differently when presenting a topic that would benefit me and everyone who may share a problem, please let me know. [\/COLOR][\/FONT]"
