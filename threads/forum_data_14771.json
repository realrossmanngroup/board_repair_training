        "PP3V3_S5_REG": "What is PP3V3_S5_REG? PP3V3_S5_REG is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. .",
        "U7200": "What is U7200? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line..",
