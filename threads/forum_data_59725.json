            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nI have a 2017 13\" MBP  that is experiencing some weird issue with the trackpad.\n\nI have a video from the client here:\n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://filedn.com/lPS38dsR703kXD64HSq1OEk/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>%20TRACKPAD%20ISSUES2.mov[/URL]\n\nUpon inspecting his Mac there is no water damage and is a clean looking board. Im just about to put another trackpad in to see if that fixes the issue.\n\nIs there anything I need to be aware of for this board to react the way it is in the video? He is using a 3rd party cable (adata) however the brick is a genuine apple charger.\n\n*Another thing to add is that it was sitting for a few months and when it came time to give the client this Mac I turned it on and it gave me a weird \n\n\"Critical software update\" error. \n\nI was unable to access the internet to install this \"Critical software update\" and what I ended up doing was cloning his old 2016 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> to this 2017 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with a thunderbolt cable and I assumed the \"Critical software update\" happened after the 1st reboot from using Carbon Copy Cloner as it did take a long time to boot into macOS the 1st time.\n\nClient complained about the trackpad last week so I did a fresh instal with a USB stick hoping that would correct the issue but as you can see in the attached video sadly it didn't :(\n\nAny advice as to where to proceed to from here if replacing the trackpad doesn't work?\n\n\nThankyou, Karl."

            "message": "So after swapping in a new trackpad and cable. I have returned the Mac with a new charger lead(even though I gave him 1  but he gave it to his daughter) Hopefully this corrects the issue.\n\nI read all the links about the Critical software update error however I could find nothing that pertains to this situation. \n\nIn my case the Mac asked for the update, I tried it and was in the boot loop of it asking and no wifi. \n\nI circumvented the update by using CCC and the users old Mac with a thunderbolt to clone his Mac to the new Mac. I would have hoped the firmware for the Critical software update would have happened when I re installed macOS after that.\n\nIt's important to note the Mac is not asking for a Critical software update now. \n\nIs there a way to force this update? I see with apple configurator app a2018-20 Macs with the T2 chip connected with a thunderbolt cable now can force 2018-20 Macs with the T2 chip to do a Critical software update \n\n- This Mac has a T1 chip \n\nHow do you force this update even if the Mac *thinks it doesn't need it?"
