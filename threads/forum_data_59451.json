            "message": "Hello. I got a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> in that had some minor liquid damage and corrosion around the backlight output caps and the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> chips. When I plugged in the app meter, it would not even turn on for either port. Found short on <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS</SIGNAL> so I replaced <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> and the short was gone. Now when I connect the charger to the port for <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>, it goes to 20v 0.60a, but the port for <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> stays at 5v 0.01a and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is 0v when using this port only. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.3v when connected to the other port so not sure what is happening. I have replaced <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> 3 times now with the same result each time so <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> is not the issue. It seems like <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is being shorted to ground whenever I used the usb port for <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>, but it measures .329 in diode mode. Any idea what could cause this?"
