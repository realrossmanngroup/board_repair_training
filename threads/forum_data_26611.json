I replaced ISL, <TRANSISTOR>Q5300</TRANSISTOR> and resistors in that area as well as <CHIP>U9500</CHIP> and components in that area. Machine turns on but is very slow to boot into OS and fans throttle high shortly after it is turned on though it doesn't seem to be overheating. When it does boot into OS everything is very slow. It does this on battery and/or on charger & trackpad/KB connected or disconnected. Thank you, have a good day."
