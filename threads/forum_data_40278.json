            "message": "Hi all again, back to pick your brains. Now as I said before, I am new to the world of mac related repairs and there is a really good chance I may have got this wrong but here goes.\nCustomer has brought in an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-b logic board. As the title suggests the owner droped milkshake on the machine. Came to me with no power. Magsafe when connected went from green to orange but no fan spin. So, here is what I have done so far:-\n<TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> had corrosion around it as did <RESISTOR>R8151</RESISTOR>/52/54 so replaced theres with known good components as another <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-b board. I restored power as when connected to the magsafe the fan spins. Connected the screen ( after checking the condition of the cable and J8300 and the screen illuminates but no image or chime.\nAfter watching Louis video Macbook Retina no backlight NEW things to check ( [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH-mWAt0CDI&t=403s[/url]) I started following his line of trouble shooting.\nI have checked for <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> and I get 1.752v. The CPU is getting warm.\nChecked pins 3&4 on J8300 and I am getting 3.301v. I have checked pins 18 & 19 <SIGNAL>PP3V3S0SW_LCD_UF</SIGNAL>  and I am getting no voltage. Tracing back I have no voltage at L8304 and <CAPACITOR>C8315</CAPACITOR> appears to be working showing 998 pf with no short. Working back again along <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_R</SIGNAL> at pins 4&5 there is 0.003v, pins 2&3 show 3.301v pin 6 is grounding OK but pin 1 is showing 0.003v. working my way back even more along <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL> to I get to <RESISTOR>R1431</RESISTOR> which is 100 Kohm resistor. It shows 31.30 Kohms when on the board and 100 Kohms when off. Run a continuity check from pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R1431</RESISTOR> to pin 1 of <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> and it shows 0.001 Kohms. Pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R1431</RESISTOR> shows no voltage going to it when powered on ( 0.003v) but is going to ground. next step back is C6 on the CPU.\n\nSo long story short, should I be suspecting the CPU/ solder to be the culprit? Should I be looking elsewhere? I do not have the facilities to remove and replace the CPU or more to the point the confidence to do it.\n\nAs usual all advice is greatfully received.\n\nOne last thing, I can obtain a replacement logic board abeit 2nd user for Â£179 ( approx 200$USD), would I be better to go for that?\n\nThanks in advance.\nMarc"

Is it meant to do that? sorry for the simplton question. as for usb activity, i have not checked for that, but back in the workshop on monday so will have a look then.\nThanks for the points to check.\nMarc"

Just an update, the customer has requested i replace the logic board as ( in his words) he is not confident that other components will not fail in the future, and seeing as the logic board is not that dear he wants to replace. on top of that he found an i7 board with 8gb RAM so he opted for the upgrade. I got as far as full illumination but still not display. however, it has been put on the to do later pile as other work is piling up. thanks for all the advice but I will be revisiting this thread as and when i get time to go back to the board."
