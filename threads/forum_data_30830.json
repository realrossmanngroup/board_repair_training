Short on PPBUS was .1 in diode. C7341 was getting very hot. I removed and now have .132 in diode on PPBUS. Same goes for S5_HS_Computing. PPDCIN is 16.8V.\nHoping the CPU is not dead, please advise on finding this short so that, I myself dont fuck it up being so close to CPU.\n\nThanks"}

Injected power and found C7340 getting hot, though this was not the short I was looking for. Replaced C7340 and injected power again. This time the board is not drawing current. Voltage set to 3.5-5V and Amps stuck at 0. Only left it on for a couple mins. Any thoughts? Thanks, have a good one."}
