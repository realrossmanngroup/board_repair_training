        "message":"Hi guys, I have a 820-3115 water damaged that didn't have green light. PP3V42_G3H was shorted to ground. The short was on U7941, I replaced it, and green light came, but didn't turn on. Later I realized PP3V3_S3 was completely short to ground too, I found the short on U2700, I replaced it, and the short disappeared. But I don't still have PP3V3_S3 high. So I looked for more shorts, and I found PP3V3_S0 has low resistance to ground (300 ohms vs 8,75k ohms in good board). When I inject voltaje, there is a draw of 0,85A at 3.3V, and u1800 (pch) seems to become hot.. Does it means I can stop working in this board? I don't have tools to replace pch.. Thank you in advance.\n\n\nUpdate: I have tried to inject 3.3V on good board on pp3v3_s0 and u1800 seems to become hot too but only drawing 0,35A.. so maybe it is not the component that is shorted, but I can't find which one is the one shorted. And I don't have a flir cam!"
