        "A2289": "What is A2289? A2289 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2020 with EMC 3456, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01987..",
        "820-1987": "What is 820-1987? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "AUX_DET": "What is AUX_DET? a SIGNAL.",
        "P_IN": "What is P_IN? a SIGNAL.",
        "3V3_G3H_RTC": "What is 3V3_G3H_RTC? 3V3_G3H_RTC Is an abbreviation of PP3V3_G3H_RTC which is one of the first rails that has to come on in order for the USB-C mux chip to be powered in the T2 chip Macbook Pros..",
        "SMC_RST_IN": "What is SMC_RST_IN? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_RST": "What is SMC_RST? a SIGNAL.",
        "EN_MVR": "What is EN_MVR? a SIGNAL.",
        "C7050": "What is C7050? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for battery current sensing, you should measure around 2.202 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging.."
