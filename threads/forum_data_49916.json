We traced it back to the SMC, after replacement short is gone we get all voltages and the fan starts to spin high. We have CPU clock and vcore. After the fan spins a while very high, it reboots and repeats. Tried another rom (has a small solder ball beside it) and checked resistors they look OK. <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> has 3.42v and on pin 5 3.42v. pin 1 3.3v (<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>). ANything else i should be checking?\n\nEDIT = I have <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> at 3.42 so looks the SMC is ok now"
