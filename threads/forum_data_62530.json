        "820-00239": "What is 820-00239? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8500": "What is U8500? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PP5V_S0SW_LCD": "What is PP5V_S0SW_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP5V_SO": "What is PP5V_SO? PP5V_SO is a typo of PP5V_S0, which is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S0 working state. The person who typed PP5V_SO thought that the S0 in PP5V_S0 was SO, if you see PP5V_SO assume the user made a typo and meant to type PP5V_S0.",
        "SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SDA is a data line between the system management controller(SMC), temperature sensors, GPU, and ALS(ambient light sensor). If this line is pulled down the machine may run slow or have the fans run fast all the time because the SMC can’t tell what the temperature of parts of the machine like fin stack are. Usual problem is bad webcam, unplug webcam to see if it fixes problem. .",

        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN? EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is necessary to enable the power rail that powers the LCD screen image circuitry. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
