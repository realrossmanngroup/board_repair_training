The board looks fine - no evidence of water. The problem is that it chimes every three seconds as soon as i plug a screen into any port. This happens on the LVDS as well as n the thunderbold port. It also turns backlight on and an external monitor recognizes it permanently (no \"\"no signal\" message) but it\u00b4s not showing a image on any screen.I also tried two screens internally and both thunderbold ports - same thing. Without any screen plugged in it chimes only once. I measured all Rails with S0 in their name andt hey are all there. Now i am stuck.\nThanks for any help"}

You could try to swap the ROM for testing. Save to old ROM!!"}
