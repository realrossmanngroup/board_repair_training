I dropped it in the cleaning tank and cleaned it up thoroughly and when I put it back together it boots right up. USB mouse now has light.  The only strange thing is that now it's doing the fan spin 3 times and then starts.  What's that about?  Other than that, seems to be working. I'm letting it run overnight on my bench with grapher to put it through a workout.  Will let you know more! Thanks!"
