        "message":"I just got in a MacBook Air Early-2014 820-3437 that powers on but goes to high RPM fan spin and the light on the charger goes to orange. This happens with AC power adapter and with battery.\nNo image\/backlight on the screen, no chime. There was some corrosion at R8131. I cleaned it up and replaced it. There was also some corrosion at U3210. I cleaned it up and reflowed it.\n\nSMC_ONOFF Measures 3.37v at R5115\n\n\nSuggestion on where I should begin? Thanks!"

USB mouse now has light.  The only strange thing is that now it's doing the fan spin 3 times and then starts.  What's that about?  Other than that, seems to be working. I'm letting it run overnight on my bench with grapher to put it through a workout.  Will let you know more! Thanks!"
