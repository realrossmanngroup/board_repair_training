They were heating different controllers hoping it will power on. The main issue was a hole in the board on <TRANSISTOR>Q7065</TRANSISTOR> Pin 5 side. I dug up and solved that, no more short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. Also, I noticed that ''maybe'' on purpose they moved the Bios chip and no.1 to 4 pin were not in place and not making a contact. Also, they removed <CAPACITOR>C4202</CAPACITOR> and when just shorted it with solder  <SIGNAL>O_O</SIGNAL>  I got to a point where I'm getting 20V on the meter and all LDO lines on CD have proper voltages.\n\n Any suggestions would be appreciated"
