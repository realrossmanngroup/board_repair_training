        "A1706": "What is A1706? A1706 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3071, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00239, 820-00923..",
        "820-00239": "What is 820-00239? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U3100": "What is U3100? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "C7023": "What is C7023? a CAPACITOR.",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",
        "R7022": "What is R7022? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution.

SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED.
