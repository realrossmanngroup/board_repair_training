Board powers and chimes but only shows flashing folder. I have tried booting to USB. It will power USB but not read it. With OPTION held down with USB and SSD I get only the network option, no available drives. Is this thing EFI locked you think? Doesnt show pad lock on screen...\n\n\nUpdate - Not EFI locked and SSD works in another machine. 3.3V at L3700. CPU?..."
