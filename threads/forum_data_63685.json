I downloaded an update from Apple, and it did another BIOS update.\nI tried again to install High Sierra, this time the installation went deeper (I saw the progress bar with the countdown), and it finally crashes. I saved the report, see attached, in case it can help, also 2 photos attached.\nWhat can I try to solve this? Flashing a new BIOS?\nThe SSD is brand new."}
