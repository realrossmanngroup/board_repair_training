        "PP5V_G3S": "What is PP5V_G3S? PP5V_G3S is a 5v power rail present when the system is in a G3S standby state.",
        "PP1V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V8_SLPS2R? PP1V8_SLPS2R is a 1.8v power rail present when the system is in a SLPS2R state. .",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
