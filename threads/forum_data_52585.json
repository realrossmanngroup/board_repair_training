But this mba turns on works fine, charge battery. Already changed SMC and ISL and same thing. \n\n\nPPBUS is 8.4 when only battery is connected and goes to 8.6 when plug magsafe, but macbook boot and works fine. If only magsafe connected without battery PPBUS is 8.2. \n\nThe main issue that sometime the machine wont start. After some time it starts again. \n\nAny idea what does 8.4V ppbus means?"}

Sounds like possibly corrosion under the SMC or on the JTAG connector. Any history liquid drop etc?"}
