No liquid, but very dust inside.\n\nI found a short on PPBUS_G3H and it leads me to U9580 small burn mark on top. So removed and short on PPBUS_G3H is gone.\nNow it has the following shorted lines:\n- PP2V5_NAND_SSD0\n- PP1V8_SSD0\nBoth readings in diode mode are 0\n\nU9500 removed and no difference.\n\nWhen injecting 1V on PP1V8_SSD0 the NAND U9100 gets warm near pin 12. Also, I can see a warm area under U9400.\nI removed L9580, L9581, C9590, C9592, C9591, C9587, CC9F0, CC9F1. Still shorting on those lines.\n\nPlease can you advise me if this is a NAND dead case?\nIf so, is it possible to replace the Nand individually, or does it need all to be replaced same time?\nThanks in advance."}
