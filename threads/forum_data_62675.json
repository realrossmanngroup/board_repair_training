No liquid, but very dust inside.\n\nI found a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and it leads me to <CHIP>U9580</CHIP> small burn mark on top. So removed and short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is gone.\nNow it has the following shorted lines:\n- <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SSD0</SIGNAL>\nBoth readings in diode mode are 0\n\n<CHIP>U9500</CHIP> removed and no difference.\n\nWhen injecting 1V on <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SSD0</SIGNAL> the NAND <CHIP>U9100</CHIP> gets warm near pin 12. Also, I can see a warm area under <CHIP>U9400</CHIP>.\nI removed L9580, L9581, <CAPACITOR>C9590</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C9592</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C9591</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C9587</CAPACITOR>, CC9F0, CC9F1. Still shorting on those lines.\n\nPlease can you advise me if this is a NAND dead case?\nIf so, is it possible to replace the Nand individually, or does it need all to be replaced same time?\nThanks in advance."
