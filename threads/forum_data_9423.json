Thank you Duke!!!\n\nI am working on a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3787</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board\n\nWhen i start the machine i got no video. The backlight is there. The machine is booting but i cannot see a picture. When the machine boots i can hear a sound when pressing the enter key for example. This means that the machine is booting fine. There is no video on HDMI and no video on DP.\n\ni meassured all the voltages for GPU rails. They are all fine. Don´t know what to do next. I know that there are two graphic cards and that the Mux is controlling them. But no idea how to make the next step.\nI forgot to mention that the board is not water damaged and looks abolutely fine. No corrosion at all.\n\nAny ideas?"
