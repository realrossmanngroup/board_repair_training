If I leave the mac on it will work until the battery runs out but if you try to restart the mac you get a flashing folder icon and the drive can't be seen at all until you charge the battery above 30%. As soon as the mac is above the 30% battery level or charger is reconnected it works perfectly, \n\nThis behaviour is the same with these ssd drives in 2 different macbooks so it's deffinatly the ssd at fault, question is have you seen anything like this before? Are these drives salvageable or do I bin them and find replacements? \n\nAlso thorght this info was useful to anyone trying to diagnose an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> whe flashing folder problem,"
