            "message": "[FONT=Calibri]Hi,[/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri]I have a couple of 27? 2015 IMacs that have pretty much the same issue.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri]They both came in with 1 light illuminated on the logic board. Usually this can be a short somewhere, but what I found was <TRANSISTOR>Q8470</TRANSISTOR> being faulty.[/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri]There as a 1V drop across this FET, meaning [FONT=Courier New]<SIGNAL>PM_PGOOD_FET_P12V_S5</SIGNAL> was low.[/FONT][/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri]I jumpered across this FET, and the board was fully alive in terms of voltages.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri]We now have 2 x diagnostic LEDs alive and LE0305 - LE0307 illuminated. [/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri]<SIGNAL>P1V0_S3_PWRGD</SIGNAL> [/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri]<SIGNAL>CPUVCC_S0_PWRGD</SIGNAL> [/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri]<SIGNAL>VCCIO_S0_PWRGD</SIGNAL> [/FONT]\n[FONT=Calibri]The above are all good[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri]I have all GPU voltages, but the board will not post. No chime.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri]<SIGNAL>GFX_OK_L</SIGNAL> is high & <SIGNAL>DP_LINK_OK</SIGNAL> is missing. Which is generated by a GPIO on the GPU, both are required for the third diagnostic LED.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri]So being out of ideas and not finding anything knock of the board I went into full brain dead mode and started trying different bios files from where ever I could find them i.e. Vinifix?[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri]No change at all. I haven?t really come across too many slimline macs with dying/dead GPUs. And so far, none on the 2015 AMD R395X.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri]I haven?t roasted this GPU to see if it will come back to life as of yet?no point since I can?t find replacement GPUs for this model. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Calibri]Any ideas, I?m still thinking vBIOS, so if anyone has a known good bios file, I would appreciate any insight.\n\nI have attached the original bios, if anyone would care to have a look.\n\n[url]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPJUfe9Vec0wiFWBAsXj0hp_-FHXiAJ9/view?usp=sharing[/url][/FONT]\n\nThanks in advance"

I'm only persevering as i`ve had about 4 of these with same fault\n\nAny ideas, would you go for a GPU swap at this point ? I'm happy to take one for the team and see where this ends up. However the availability of 216-0872024 is non existent.\n\nIdeas welcome ??\n\nThanks"
