            "message": "Today I receive a Macbook <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, board is <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00138</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. Problem start with a water spill over the keyboard.\nCustomer clean the board before bringing to us. Macbook turns on, you get the apple sound a few seconds later apple logo shows for a second and Macbook turns off and starts to bootloop, always showing the apple for a second. Booting presing commands for PRAM does nothing, if you start with a pendrive and alt key, MAcbook shows the drives, if you select the internal ssd the Apple shows longer, a quarter of the loading bar, then bootloop starts.If pendrive is selected loading bar goes almost 3 quarters, the bootloop.\n\nIn the inside board looks really nice, almost no dust, but I found signs of water in two places, in <TRANSISTOR>Q3080</TRANSISTOR> and the capacitor next to it, I clean with flux and hot air, maybe I need to change 3080.\nhe other place is in <TRANSISTOR>Q6060</TRANSISTOR>, and <CAPACITOR>C3532</CAPACITOR> both with just a little oxidation, not shorted and fans work normal.\n\nShould I continue looking for water damage, or is most likely a EFI/BIOS problem?"

With internal SSD loads half way and turns off, but with another SSD works fine, I think problem is OSX and not the SSD, will try to fix OSX later.\n\nWith the new SSD, I reconnect everything and apple logo 1 second and bootloop. I disconnect TP and macbook boots, but KB is not recognized.\nWith USB KB and mouse I can log in the machine.\n\nAlso try new KB and TP and machine don't boot up, just 1 second logo and bootloop. If I only try new KB machine boot, but KB is not recognized.\n\nI search again for corrosion, and <CAPACITOR>C5125</CAPACITOR> was cleaned, one side is black and the other is normal, so water was in that part of the board at some point. Can <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> be the problem?"
