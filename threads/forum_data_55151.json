        "message":"Today I receive a Macbook A1398, board is 820-00138. Problem start with a water spill over the keyboard.\nCustomer clean the board before bringing to us. Macbook turns on, you get the apple sound a few seconds later apple logo shows for a second and Macbook turns off and starts to bootloop, always showing the apple for a second. Booting presing commands for PRAM does nothing, if you start with a pendrive and alt key, MAcbook shows the drives, if you select the internal ssd the Apple shows longer, a quarter of the loading bar, then bootloop starts.If pendrive is selected loading bar goes almost 3 quarters, the bootloop.\n\nIn the inside board looks really nice, almost no dust, but I found signs of water in two places, in Q3080 and the capacitor next to it, I clean with flux and hot air, maybe I need to change 3080.\nhe other place is in Q6060, and C3532 both with just a little oxidation, not shorted and fans work normal.\n\nShould I continue looking for water damage, or is most likely a EFI\/BIOS problem?"

        "message":"USB OSX without KB\/TP boots normal. With internal SSD loads half way and turns off, but with another SSD works fine, I think problem is OSX and not the SSD, will try to fix OSX later.\n\nWith the new SSD, I reconnect everything and apple logo 1 second and bootloop. I disconnect TP and macbook boots, but KB is not recognized.\nWith USB KB and mouse I can log in the machine.\n\nAlso try new KB and TP and machine don't boot up, just 1 second logo and bootloop. If I only try new KB machine boot, but KB is not recognized.\n\nI search again for corrosion, and C5125 was cleaned, one side is black and the other is normal, so water was in that part of the board at some point. Can U5110 be the problem?"
