        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "Q7130": "What is Q7130? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "PPBUSS_G3H": "What is PPBUSS_G3H? This is a typo of PPBUS_G3H When you see PPBUSS_G3H, assume they meant to type PPBUS_G3H.",
        "R7105": "What is R7105? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. ."
