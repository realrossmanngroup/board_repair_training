It went into dfu mode for configurator but no luck tried monterey Big Sur and Catalina, tried external monitor, tried safe mode and all the usual T2 commands for smc pram etc, tried target disk mode, tried with and without battery connected, tried disconnecting everything including trackpad, no caps lock light and obviously no chime. The fans always start up when you do anything to power it on, sometimes the fans stay on quiet, and sometimes the machine turns off after a minute with a high fan spinout. when I long press the power button to turn it off, and then unplug the usb c power adapter, the fans will turn back on again after a few seconds, and sometimes stay on and sometimes \"spin out\". <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12+V. suggestions? thanks in advance!"
