It went into dfu mode for configurator but no luck tried monterey Big Sur and Catalina, tried external monitor, tried safe mode and all the usual T2 commands for smc pram etc, tried target disk mode, tried with and without battery connected, tried disconnecting everything including trackpad, no caps lock light and obviously no chime. The fans always start up when you do anything to power it on, sometimes the fans stay on quiet, and sometimes the machine turns off after a minute with a high fan spinout. when I long press the power button to turn it off, and then unplug the usb c power adapter, the fans will turn back on again after a few seconds, and sometimes stay on and sometimes \"spin out\". PPBUS_G3H is 12+V. suggestions? thanks in advance!"}

There are many CPU core points on this board but not sure which if any should have certain voltage. thank you"}

I do not know of a way to have the battery plugged in, so I have the multimeter probes where they need to be and then I plug the board into power (96W genuine apple) and monitor voltage. at that point, the voltage reads zero for about 10 seconds and then .975 forever, I never see it at .6\/.7. what should I infer from this, is the board stuck, not booting?"}
