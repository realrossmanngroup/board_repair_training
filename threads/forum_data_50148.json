It does not recognize its original A1496 battery although coconut battery app shows it has 98% design capacity in other machines. Another strange thing is that it sees the other original A1496 batteries at 100% (pre login as in photo) while in fact booting off the MagSafe. The battery is at 60% on the other machines.\n\nP.S. I only use 85w original Magsafe chargers on bench without adapters."
