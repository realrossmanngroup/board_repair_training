I'm french and I hope that you can guide me in this exploration.:rolleyes::rolleyes:\n\nI have check around U7000 chip for Resistance\/smd ceramic page 63 of 101(page Pbus Supply & Battery charger) I just have exchange 2 resistances(R7021 & R7022 because not 10\u03a9 was present after desoldering..)\nI have desoldering U7000 (ISL6259) check few tracks finally resoldering this chip.I did not find anything wrong.about that. (tell me if I'm wrong;)).\nI have somes questions for differents mesures:\nWhy in place C7056\/C7057\/C7050 have 2.55mFarads on tester while components are ok?The same for C7011--->0.000536\u00b5F in place and desoldering 0.049\u00b5F so I decide to change it for 0.02\u00b5F(normaly 0.01\u00b5F \u00b110%, in pdf). \/C7000 2.7\u00b5F in place and 1,2\u00b5Fdesold..\nI observed a decrease in voltage in pins 7,8,9 of battery connector(J6950)--->3.42V to 0V...??\nSo I have R7039 and C7039 are missing on my board, and present on the board view (it's not grave if I don't have the good revision of board view or pdf?)\nI'm happy to post here.\nThanks in advance for your help.\nSee you soon.\nLucas\nFrance."}
