Green light all G3H rails OK but at PP5V_S5 and down all I get is pulsing.\n\nSMC_PM_G2_EN and S5_PWRGD pulsing.\n\nSMC_PM_G2_EN does not pulse at Q7080 but does pulse everywhere else.\n\nAlso pulsing are:\n- PP5V_SUS\n- PP5V_S3\n- PP5V_S0\n- PP3V3_S4\n- PP3V3_SUS\n\nReplaced U7201, issue persists.\nFirst time I see this, not sure where to go from here.\n\nPower draw on PSU jumps from 0.008 to 0.036, occasional spike to 0.166 amps."}

Q7080 is also on that line according to the boardview so that\u2019s where I also measured, is my bv messed up?\n\nPPBUS at 18.5v, drawing from memory so if that\u2019s not accurate I can re-messure later. Number looked right at time of measuring else I\u2019d have made note of it."}

BV is only for reference when looking up stuff, verify on the schematic. PPBUS at 18V would be bad...check."}
