Green orange light is on when charger plugged in but no power. PP5V_S4 missing. Checked P5VS4_EN and its missing. It comes from u8170 S4_PWR_en where pin 2-  PM_SLP_S5_L is 0V. A little bit strange as P5VS4_EN= 0.07V but S4 PWR EN= 0V. Where does the 0.07V comes from? Chip U7501 itself ? Any help?"}

I have managed to turn the board on with holding power button on-removing charger while holding button-and plugging charger back in while holding button still and it turned on. so fans started to spin but no chime or video. i was measuring around u7310 as there was no power from L7310, l7320,l7330 and u73010 had power present but nothing on output. then i touched pin 40 with pin 39 by accidend and now i bumped into another problem as dont have PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS. when i touched them two pins board switched off and now PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS= 0.5V what the hell have i F***ked up. any ideas what was wrong when it was working with no chime and what have i shorted now? please dont judge as i am just enthusiast with repairing not professional."}

Gonna check power rails whats missing. any ideas what to check first or why it only switches on with bypass? thanks."}
