            "message": "Hello,\nI have this board that had short to ground on CB300 due to a liquid spill on that side. It was isolated liquid damage on that side of the board.\nAfter repairing that the left fan (looking from top) now starts at max speed and stays there. The other fan is not even on.\n\nI can control both fans with software.\nI tried a known good top case with keyboard, trackpad, fans etc..\n\nHWSensors shows all standard except airport proximity 129 degrees.\n\nAny idea what to check?"

However, after a few hours, I left it to sleep. While asleep the fan started on its own and now the issue is back again.\n\nI am pretty sure there is no corrosion or crap under, I also don't have another 00239, I do have an 00850 but probably the SMC is different.\nIs it worth ordering a donor for the SMC or it's unlikely that replacing it will fix the issue?"
