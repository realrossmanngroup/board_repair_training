            "message": "so this board was no power initially. \nhad corrosion under UB300 and UB400, replaced both cd3215s\nBoard works, but now it intermittently looses the SSD: 1 out of 10 times it can boot fully, but other times questionmark-folder.\nThe 3v3 and 1v8 for the SSD are there and stable (even when it cant see the SSD), the NANDs are getting pretty hot where icant put my finger on it too long (dont really know if that's normal)\n\nThese things are completely underfilled around the NANDs so reflowing would be a total bitch,  I don't know if there's anything left to check before giving up?\nI also don't see how this could be affected by liquid (probably not?) because of those underfilled chips?"
