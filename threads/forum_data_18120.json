So I hoping someone can confirm that I have smc issue.\n\n820-3235 - no green light not water damaged. doesnt turn on.\nPPBUS_G3H - present\nPP3V42_G3H - ok\nPP5V_S5 - missing\nPP3V3_S5 - missing\nI checked U7501 and figure SMC_PM_G2_EN is missing, I checked resistance to ground on SMC_PM_G2_EN and it is fine(not broken)"}

R5100 is fine.\n\nI replaced U5510 (SN0903049) with SN0903048 from 820-3209, pin out and signals look the the same on the chip. I got 3.4 on SMC_RESET\n\nI got green\/yellow light. Macbook turns on BUT i have new issue, not sure were to start to diagnose it. It turns off randomly 1-4 min is max. Light on the chargers switches green when it turns off and then switches back to yellow. I can easily turn it on after it turns off. It looks like it simply loosing power. It does the same thing with or without battery."}

Can it be smc it self since U5110 close to it and could get hot"}

In what causes green lights causes the board not to response to power button and auto turn on? Do you think SMC bad?"}
