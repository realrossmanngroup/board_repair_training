        "SSD_PWR_EN": "What is SSD_PWR_EN? SSD_PWR_EN is a signal that tells the chip making the power rail for the SSD to turn on when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

SSD_RESET_CONN_L is a signal that goes to the SSD that will put it in RESET mode which will keep it from working, when SSD_RESET_L is present. _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. .",

I couldn't figure out how to do a continuity test without an extra set of arms or soldering a jumper wire to each Cap so I re-flowed them and it worked. I never would have suspected them as they were as clean as the rest of the board, it never had a Liquid spill but it was overheating badly when I replaced the display and did a thermal a few weeks earlier."
