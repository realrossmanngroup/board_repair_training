If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

Get a sparkle of 5V on L7260 when quarter fan spin. Already verified all traces around ISL and all look good. There was no corrosion at all on this board!

I think this machine had been worked on before he bought it(he bought it used but working), but cannot be sure because it had no oxidation points nor solder marks on it...
