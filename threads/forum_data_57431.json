            "message": "Hello,\n\nI have a complicated <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that came from another shop. Many parts have been screwed with including CD3215C00 area, F7000 (only one side connected), <CAPACITOR>C3000</CAPACITOR> was missing.\n\nReplaced secondary CD3215C00 because it was very hot. Still 5v on type C charger.\nSMC was shorting <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> unfortunately. Removed SMC, short gone. Replaced SMC with new one, also replaced ISL <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> because it was missing.\nConnected charger on primary connector. 5v 0 amps for a few seconds then 20 volts very low amps. Thought I got it working..\nDisconnected charger and tried secondary connector. Now it just stays at 5v 0.61 / 0.41 watts (I forgot the amps)\nDisconnected charger and tried primary again. Same 5v 0.61 / 0.41 watts, no longer switching to 20 volts\nReplaced the CD3215C00's again and was able to get 20 volts for a short time until I disconnect and reconnect to other port then it will just stay at 5v. 20v would be present as long as I keep the charger connected, but once reconnected it will be forever gone until I replace <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>.\nI did this several times because either it would bring down <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> down to 2v (<CAPACITOR>C3100</CAPACITOR> / <CAPACITOR>C3200</CAPACITOR>) or it would not have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> at all because <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> is not being told to switch.\n\nI also notice that F3000 / F3010 would measure 5v, but <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> <TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> doesn't allow the 5v to go through to <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> to power <CHIP>U6990</CHIP>, which means no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> to power the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s. It would only work if I use fresh new CD3215C00's.\n\nWhat could be the issue? Any advice that anyone can give me?\n\nI may have to try a new SMC or give up since I went through a lot of chips already unless there is something I am missing.\n\nThanks!"
