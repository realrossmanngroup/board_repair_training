When plugged in the light on the charger is blinking.\nPPBUS_G3H i fluctuating between 3.5V and 11.5V, at least this is what i can read on my multimeter. I guess something makes the charger start and stop.\nIt does not run on either battery or charger.\n\nCurrent sensing resistors measures fine.\nIf I remove F7000 or R7008 the blinking slows down.\nIf I remove both F7000 and R7008 I get solid green light and PPBUS_G3H is 12.5V.\n\nThere is no short to ground om PPBUS_G3H.\n\nI have measured resistance to ground on both PPBUS_G3H and PP3V42_G3H and they are both very high.\n\nI have replaced U7000.\nI have replaced both Q7020 and Q7021.\nI have replaced C7008.\n\nI do need some pointers now, I feel I'm looking in the wrong place."}
