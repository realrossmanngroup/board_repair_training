After UC and replacing ISL6259 (followed the rabbit hole) the system boots fine and works as expected but:\n\n1) the battery must be shorted since the magsafe adapter also shorts when the battery is connected and the macbook wont start - I did not do extensive testing on that not to destroy 6259 again.\n2) the magsafe adapter goes from green to orange even with the battery disconnected.\n\nThe question is why the magsafe adapter does that? Is there some sensing part that detects the battery and turns green light to orange?\n\nOther than that the system looks great and unfortunately I have no spare battery to do further tests i.e. if the battery is actually charging etc.\n\nBR,\nGeorge"}

I will also let him know that there is a slim chance for re-examining the board incase it does not charge the new bat. thank you louis."}
