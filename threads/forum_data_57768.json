With normal boot the macbook ask me for a critical uptade, tried with wifi, wired cable and I also tried what this guy say on a forum ([URL=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/309808/macbook-pro-2016-touch-bar-in-critical-update-loop\"]https://apple.stackexchange.com/ques...al-update-loop[/URL]). No liquid damage, I had some weird stuff around <CHIP>U4200</CHIP> (picture attached), the rest of the board is nice, I cleaned this area but still have the problem. I tried with a known good Touchbar, a know good casing and keyboard, also with disconnected display, still have the problem of critical update. I tried to boot on an external SSD (same), I also tried clear ME Region.\n\nWith all this done, I think it's a board level problem and I have make some measurements on J4401 and J4402.\n\n[B]J4401[/B]\nPIN 10 <SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_INT</SIGNAL> = 0,05\nPIN 12 <SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> = 0\nPIN 18 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_DFR</SIGNAL> = 3,3V\n\n[B]J4402[/B]\nPIN 20 <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0SW_DFR</SIGNAL> = 1,8\nPIN 19 <SIGNAL>DFR_TOUCH_ROM_WC</SIGNAL> = 0,04\nPIN 18 <SIGNAL>DFR_TOUCH_RESET_L</SIGNAL> = 1,8\nPIN 13 <SIGNAL>DFR_TOUCH_INT_L</SIGNAL> = 0,08\nPIN 9 <SIGNAL>DFR_TOUCH_SPI_CLK_R</SIGNAL> = 0,08\n\n[B]<CHIP>U4406</CHIP>[/B]\nPIN 4 <SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_SMC_RST_L</SIGNAL> = 3,42V\nPIN 2 <SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_RSDT_L</SIGNAL> = 0V\nPIN 6 <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0</SIGNAL> = 1,8V\n<RESISTOR>R4400</RESISTOR> = 98K OK\n<RESISTOR>R4490</RESISTOR> = 0,125MOhms NOK\n\nSo it's missing <SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and there is a strange value on <RESISTOR>R4490</RESISTOR>, it is a \"no stuff\" resistance and it should be 0ohms. Should I run a wire there ?"
