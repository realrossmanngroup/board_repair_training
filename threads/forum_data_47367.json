Why would the ME region be related to a random-shutdown issue, without any additional information? Why not suspect bad RAM, faulty CPU/PCH, SMC, etc? I've seen many of these 00165 boards that have random-shutdown issues, all with no liquid damage or anything at all. Some last hours, some last a few minutes. Have tried BIOS (new dump and force-update/manual clean), as well as new SMC, reflow RAM (among other things) on many of them with no luck, so just curious as the reason you suspected BIOS right off the bat. Thanks! :)\n\nI resolved 2 of them successfully; on both, the issue was with <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>/FETs. Replaced and boards continued to work fine. This did not work for several others; was hoping there would be some specific type of common fault, but it wasn't so. Also considered that many of these clean \"random shutdown\" boards might be manifesting symptoms that prelude the failure of one of the front tantalum caps that occurs on these every now and then. If not, I suspect they were all dropped at some point. None fail RAM tests, but maybe CPU damage. Anyway, just a thought."
