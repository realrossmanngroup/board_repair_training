The customer told me that after he putting it for a while on the rice, he has started it to take a important file from it, then he brought it to me.\nBy trying to dry it he lifted most of the kies of the keyboard. He told me that it was still working.\n\nAfter checking it by the microscope, I ve found nothing strange on the board, no corrosion or calcination of componant. Just some water traces I ve cleaned with the alcohol and tooth brush.\n\nI tried to boot it by pressing the PB, but nothing is happening. I ve no schematics of this model, but I could read a 3V3 on one of the coils.\n\nPlease any idea."
