Found a broken line under <DIODE>D3309</DIODE> and after fixing that short is gone. Also replaced <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> for a new one as this one showed a slightly higher temp in Flircam then the one besides it. <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> also was hot, replaced that for a new one. Now nothing on the board gets hot but still, 5.18v on the charger and 0.02A. No short one the below lines:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.41\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = drops from 5V to 0 slowly\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> = 5.21v\n\nAny ideas?"

I just read somewhere, these IC are programmed? Im not sure if these IC are new, they look like they have been reballed. Just to make sure, will use the CD3215s from a donor board instead and try that."
