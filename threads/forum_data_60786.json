Tried to map the water to <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> boardview.  Water was at <TRANSISTOR>Q7660</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7680</TRANSISTOR>.   Water discolored crystal Y1900.  Water was at some tiny resistor near the crystal that I could not determine identity using the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> boardview.\n\nUltrasonic cleaned. \n\nBoard seems to boot, with no display. 20v and 1-2A current. Charges the battery. Put board in a known good housing for <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>--same, no display.\nUsb-c makes sound on connect/disconnect.\n\nTried to check external display as follows: Plug in usb-c HDMI dongle, connect monitor. No image on monitor. Confirmed known good <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> produces external display.\n\nChecked board again. Now found blown filter--may have missed on first look. Filter is probably L6701, L6702, L6703 by mapping to <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. Likely trackpad.\n\nTested board again making sure trackpad not plugged in. \n\nNo display.\n\nDiode mode at J8500 compared to logi.wiki for <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. No short or open found.\n\nAnd here I am! \n\nWhat is the next step? Keep in mind I am not very experienced with Macbooks in general and may be missing some basics."
