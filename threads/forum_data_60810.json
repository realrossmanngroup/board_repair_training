I understand what they are and I understand that all of them up to (and including) <SIGNAL>XXX_S0</SIGNAL> must be at correct voltages.\nNow, If I close the lid, the system goes to sleep and enters state S3, does it mean that all _S0 voltages are going to 0V?\n\nThank you!"

I know that S0 voltages must exist after all previous _S3 and _S4 are created successfully. I thought <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> will be created directly from <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL>, but this is not the case, it is created from S5 voltage but only after S3 voltage is present (which is used as Enable signal)."
