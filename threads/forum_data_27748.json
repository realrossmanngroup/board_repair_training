I tried replacing U8030 to no avail. No shorts around U8030, all resistors are showing corrector values. I'm not sure where to look for the cause at this point. There are signs of water damage around the trackpad, but someone else has had a go at this board so I'm not entirely sure if there was any corrosion elsewhere."}

It initially came in from a friend because the fan wasn't starting. Everything else was working fine. My diagnosis came from finding that once the board was powered up I was getting 0v on pp3v3_s0 on r6061. I didn't at the time know about the different power states - only until I saw your post here asking about S4. I'm still not entirely sure how it works. I have tried to track back through schematic of power rail of pp3v3_s0 in order to find where the power drop happens and found that pp3v3_s5_reg gives power to pp3v3_s0, hence why I mention that in the original post.\n\nAnyway, since the original post I'm now getting fan spinning but am no longer getting hard drive recognition! I'm not entirely sure why this has happened."}

I'll find out tomorrow. Anyway, now it's question mark on 2 confirmed working hard drives. Also, the fan spins immediately when plugging in the AC but only if the battery is plugged in first.\n\nAs far as I remember, all I've done is replace U8030 and cleaned corrosion on the trackpad board."}
