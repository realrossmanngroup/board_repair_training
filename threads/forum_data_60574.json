Only works if battery cable (j6951) is disconnected. When connected it draws up to 4a and no life but fans do spin. Caps light doesnt work this way. Disconnect the cable and it works fine with or without screw. \n\nDiode to ground pins on j6951 match another board. \nTried another case\/batt with no change. \nReplaced U5000, U7000, U7800 in that order. No changes. \n\nWhen cable is plugged in the amp meter immediately starts at 1.6a and climbs to 4a. Without cable it starts at 0.4a goes up to 1.Xa then back down to 0.4a then starts (this is normal from what I've seen)."}
