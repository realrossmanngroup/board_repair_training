        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U7800": "What is U7800? a CHIP.",
        "U5000": "What is U5000? This is the System Management Controller(SMC) in macbooks from 2013-2015.",

        "CHGR_BMON": "What is CHGR_BMON? CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",
        "CHGR_AMON": "What is CHGR_AMON? CHGR_AMON provides DC current sense information to the SMC(System management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip). It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",

        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "R7060": "What is R7060? a RESISTOR.",
        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging.."

Caps light doesnt work this way. Disconnect the cable and it works fine with or without screw. \n\nDiode to ground pins on j6951 match another board. \nTried another case/batt with no change. \nReplaced <CHIP>U5000</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> in that order. No changes. \n\nWhen cable is plugged in the amp meter immediately starts at 1.6a and climbs to 4a. Without cable it starts at 0.4a goes up to 1.Xa then back down to 0.4a then starts (this is normal from what I've seen)."
