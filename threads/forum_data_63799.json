        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",

I replaced a visibly burnt FET driver for\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> (<TRANSISTOR>Q7291</TRANSISTOR>) and several components around it. This restored <SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> to the expected 0.8-1.1V. \n\nHowever, I'm missing CPU VORE (<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>). The big coils all measure over 10Ω to ground, no I don't suspect the CPU to be shorted out.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.6V and <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is 1.8V. DFU Restore concludes successfully with a padlock on the host machine (but no video on the target machine).\n\n<SIGNAL>CPUCORE_FCCM</SIGNAL>, the enable signal for <CHIP>U7230</CHIP>, is around 2V for a few seconds, then drops to 0V instead of increasing to 5.1V like on a good board.\n\nHow can I convince myself that the CPU is damaged and beyond repair?"
