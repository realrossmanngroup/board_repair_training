        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U8020": "What is U8020? a CHIP.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_S0_PGOOD": "What is PM_S0_PGOOD?  PM_S0_PGOOD is created when CPUVR_PGOOD and ALL_SYS_PWRGD are present and branches off to become PM_PCH_PWROK. PM_S0_PGOOD and SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD are necessary to create SYS_PWROK_R and PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK .",
        "SYS_PWROK_R": "What is SYS_PWROK_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "CPUVR_PGOOD_R": "What is CPUVR_PGOOD_R? CPUVR_PGOOD_R is a signal that comes from CPU_VR_EN that is necessary along with ALL_SYS_PWRGD to create PM_S0_PGOOD.",
        "Q8150": "What is Q8150? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "ALL_SYS": "What is ALL_SYS? This is a typo of ALL_SYS_PWRGD When you see ALL_SYS, assume they meant to type ALL_SYS_PWRGD.",

I have no vcore and cpu is cold.\n\nOn <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> i have all the inputs around 0.7v but <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is 0.2v (i think this should be 3.3v?)\n\nI replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> just in case but no luck.\n\nOn <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> i have SMC DELAYED, 3v42 and <SIGNAL>CPUVR_PGOOD_R</SIGNAL>.\n\nBut all sys is 0.2v and <SIGNAL>PM_S0_PGOOD</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>SYS_PWROK_R</SIGNAL> are both 0v\n\nany ideas?"
