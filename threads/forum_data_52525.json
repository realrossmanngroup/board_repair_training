Now all repaired, reballed SMC and now it work fine, all main lines are ok except of PPBUS is 8.2V.\n\nSMC is already reballed. ANother issue is that it doesnt detect the battery.\n\n\nAny idea where to check? All that was burnt damaged had been replaced.\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nP.S: ISL625 pins 17\/18 and 27\/28 are ok 4ohms and 20 ohms."
