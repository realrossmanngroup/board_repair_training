I power it up and i get a blank screen. so I check the cap and I realised this must have shorted the PP1v5R1V35 line. I took the caps out and soldered the right polarity this time. i power the board up but i still get blank screen. <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_GPU</SIGNAL> was 0v, then i decide to touch up the solder on <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>. but i was still getting a blank screen. i then replace <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and bingo i got a picture \n\nThen i decide to run ASD and 1 sensor error comes up:\n\n\n[IMG type=\"full\" width=\"200px\"]https://i.imgur.com/86pdtmU.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[URL=\"https://i.imgur.com/4KRPgoC.jpg\"][IMG type=\"full\" width=\"200px\"]https://i.imgur.com/4KRPgoC.jpg[/IMG][/URL]"

I then used that to dump the ROM and opened the resulting file in a hex editor. I located the eBay board serial number in the file and changed it to the desired number. I made sure not to add any extra spaces or anything, and made sure the string was still located at the same offsets as the original. I saved the file and wrote it back onto the ROM. i have even tried just writing zeros then use Blank Board Serializer to write the number that way, but it just had an error and wouldn't do anything.\n\nThis is the ROM, ME region is all good, just want the serial number to change:\n\n[URL=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uiiEmMvejOlK_y7EDqSnZe8yz428_pFF\"]https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ui...SnZe8yz428_pFF[/URL]\n\nthe serial number i want. : C02JC22TDKQ4"
