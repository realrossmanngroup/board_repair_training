Yes, downloaded and flashed with two different ones and kept original too obviously.\nOnly fault history I have is the description from the seller which said that the macbook ''came in with'' a blown battery and looked like liquid damage. The 'came in with' part suggests to me they are a repairer who MAY have cleaned of liquid damage and/or tried to repair before I got.\n\nThe only thing I found was <RESISTOR>R5127</RESISTOR> which looked like one end was black/dark grey and although it tested at 0ohm, I replaced anyway.

I usually avoid anything that even hints of being repaired, especially if they mention 'local computer shop' who almost always do not know anything about Macs and seem to undo things with a hammer, chissel and blowtorch before putting it kind of back in the case and claiming not repairable.\n\nI am usually careful when buying on ebay etc also, especially the magic term ''untested'' which always means extensively tested and repairs attempted before giving up and selling.\n\nBut this one I simply did not read the ad. I didn't pay much, but as a 2015 model it would be nice to get it back to life. If it still had the liquid damage, I might have a chance, but once cleaned off we all know how bad these can be.\n\nHad a really carefull examination of the board before. No missing or knocked off parts at least. Also SMC still has edge bonding, so there is some small hope.\n\nI will do some more checking, but it is frustrating when they spin the fan, get green/orange light,  all rails present yet no cpu cativity and by that I mean no USB activity."
