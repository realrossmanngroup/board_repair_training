            "message": "Hi guys\n\nGot an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> here that has a backlight issue. No sign of any liquid damage on the board, all seems clean.\n\nThe screen has a display, but the backlight is intermittent. By that I mean that sometimes it will boot normally, screen will light, all is good.\n\nSometimes however it won't light up, it has a display but no backlight.\n\nIf I close the lid, the screen turns off as usual, opening it again results in no backlight most of the time.\n\nIs there any point I should be starting to look at first?\n\n<SIGNAL>PPV_OUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> (measured at Pin1 of LVDS connector) is 38v when functioning but reads at 11.5v when backlight is off.\n\nI dimly recall something about <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> and the hall sensor - is that a common area I should look at?\n\nMany thanks"
