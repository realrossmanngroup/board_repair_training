The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

Of course I have no <SIGNAL>PP1V5_GPU_REG</SIGNAL> and I measure 0V on <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL>, too.\n\nI see <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is generated by <TRANSISTOR>Q7860</TRANSISTOR>, should I remove that and inject 5V with a power supply to see what gets hot? (there is also <CAPACITOR>C7860</CAPACITOR> there which I may also have to remove just incase it shorts).\n\nShould I replace <CHIP>U9500</CHIP> first? Since it gets hot maybe thats the one shorted to ground?\n\nWhere would you start?\n\nPlease advise :)\n\n\nBR,\ngeorge"
