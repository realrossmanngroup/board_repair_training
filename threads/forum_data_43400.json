This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

After that macbook turned on, begin to charge the battery for some minutes. Than failed again.\n\n\nNow when connect magsafe first it begins with intermiten green light, after a minute it stays stable. PPBUS about 1,5V. All other rails seems be present and ok.\n\nRandomly light turn amber but no change in rails voltages.\n\nAny idea?"
