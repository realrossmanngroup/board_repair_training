But perfect, without oxidation.\n\nThere was a short on the PPBus because of the Q7430. Replaced it, board turned on again, but with RAM beeping.\n\nI have 1.35v on PP1V35_S3, but when I test it off, it shows as a short (023.1), in 0.040 diode mode.\n\nI compared it with another board, diode mode is 0.110 and there is no short on this line."}
