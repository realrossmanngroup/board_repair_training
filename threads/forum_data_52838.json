Fans do spin (first 3 seconds on, then 3 seconds off, then stays on). Heat sink gets warm (not hot). No visible damage on the board.\nS0 rails like <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> are good.\n\nSince the CPU doesn't seem to do anything I focused on that:\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> = 0.77V (should be 1.25V ?)\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL> = 0.98V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3_CPU_VCCDQ</SIGNAL> = 1.5V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0_CPU_VCCPQE</SIGNAL> = 1.05V\n\nSchematic says <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> should be 1.25V, but I kind of doubt if that is right.\n\nMeasured some power-good signals:\n<SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWRGD</SIGNAL> = 3.46V\n<SIGNAL>CPU_PWRGD</SIGNAL> = 1.04V\n<SIGNAL>PM_MEM_PWRGD</SIGNAL> = 1.5V\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> = 3.33V\n\nAll seem fine to me. Not sure what to check next. Kinda looks like a dead CPU to me."
