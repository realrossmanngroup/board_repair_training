I took some measurements of the backlight driver and connector with the backlight plugged in.\n\nJ7715\nPins 1\/2 - 0v\nPins 3\/4 - 4.94v\n\nU7750 \nPin 1  - 4.94v\nPin 2 - 5.01v\nPin 7 - 5.01v\nPins 3\/4\/5\/6\/8 - 0v\n\nI checked on a probe point for SMC_SYS_KBDLED and there was no signal. There was liquid damage near the SMC before I UC'ed the machine."

When I cover the isight camera the brightness on the screen dims but still no light on the keyboard.\n\nUpdate: I did some google searches on this and read that once I cover the isight camera I would then be able to the adjust the keyboard brightness. That solved the issue.\n\nThanks Duke!"
