Resistance mode correct?\nNo worries. I found it on ifixit how to do it [URL=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+To+Use+A+Multimeter/25632#s65006\"]https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+To+...r/25632#s65006[/URL]\n\n2. reflow <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> and LED driver.. How much temperature?\n\nOk. So now ive check the resistors: <RESISTOR>R7731</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R7715</RESISTOR>\n\n<RESISTOR>R7731</RESISTOR> Shows 120k (should be in schematic 200k), <RESISTOR>R7715</RESISTOR> shows 99.6k (in schematic it says 100K, so that one is ok).\n\nThat means <RESISTOR>R7731</RESISTOR> needs to be changed?"

Love to fix my first board.. Im going to stay on this thread until we have solved this board.. Will be my first.. hope thats ok with you?\n\nIve checked pin 5, the ball is still there under when lookin in the microscope. but its hard to measure it, since its under the IC.\n\n1. Ok, i start reflow the LED driver first and then we see next step. back in a bit.. Ps. How do I find the LED DRIVER?? :)\n\n<CHIP>U7701</CHIP> is the LED driver..
