Also in <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01949</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> this signal seems to be independent for all CD3217s while in <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> it is shared for each <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> pair and doesn't seem to have a pull-up to LDO.\n\nI assume <SIGNAL>TBT_T_CIO_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is the same pad for all CD3217s in all motherboards.\n\n5V/0.275A at USB-C meter.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n[ATTACH]60156[/ATTACH]"

It was the Intel Retimer JHL8040R (every <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> has one JHL8040R companion), and when removed the short cleared. I soldered back the second <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> (good one) I removed at the beginning to take comparison measurements and left out the LD <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> and of course the shorted Intel JHL8040R hoping that the board can start or reach 20V without thise. Unfortunately the board keeps going to 5V/0.280A and at this point with the thermal camera I also noticed the T2 gets a bit warm. Not sure if thats normal or T2 is toast and thus game over.
