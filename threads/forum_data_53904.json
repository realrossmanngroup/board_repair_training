The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence.."

            "message": "I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3435</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B board. I am used to turning on a board by just attaching the MagSafe and watching the green light come on and the machine power up. This one is a bit strange but it may just be that way and I don't know better.\n\nWhen I power it up it works perfect. While in the OS I shut down. When the machine powers off I remove the MagSafe and reattach. Green light, then no power. <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> is at 3.3v. I can attach the MagSafe as many times as I want and it does not auto start but if I pull <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> to ground it fires right up. And each time I remove and attach the MagSafe after I do this it works perfect. Only if I shutdown in the OS do I have to do this. This seems normal but at the same time it doesn't.\n\nBefore I figured out the <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> I pulled the SMC and reballed it.   Cleaned the elephant skin pads thinking there was a SMC issue.\n\n\nHow is this supposed to work?"
