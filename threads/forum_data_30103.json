All WDI are intact and looks like it hasnt made any contact with the board except around battery connector.\n\nSO FAR: under inspection of microscope everything looks super clean except one cap next to battery which I replace from a different board. still no power. despite being so clean i still ran through the ultrasonic.\n\nAny suggestions?"
