But I had to replace the connector for the touchpad on the board because it was corroded. \nThe problem is the battery. It boots with only battery connected but after 30-60 sec it turns off. If I unplug MagSafe when the computer is running it runs from the battery for 30-60 sec and then it turns off. \nThe battery is charging and there is no X on the battery icon in OS x"
