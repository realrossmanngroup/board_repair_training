I'm getting a green then organ light from the charger but no fan spin when powered.\n\nMeasured voltages:\n\nPP3v3_s5 = 3.336\nPP3V3_G3H = 3.401\nPP3V3_SUS = 3.336\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.589\nPP5V_S5 = 5.014\nPP5V_S4RS3 = 0.0012\nPP5V_S0 = 0.00\n\nAm I expecting PP5V_S0 or PP5V_S4RS3 as soon as the power connector is plugged in? or do I need to hit the keyboard power button.  I notice in Louis? videos he never seems to have a keyboard plugged in or ?do anything? to initiate boot up\n\nAny help much appreciated."}
