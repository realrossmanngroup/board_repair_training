        "message":"Hi all,\n\nI have a 2014 MBP with no backlight, image is present with torch under screen.\n\nBacklight Output = 12v\nKG Display has been tested.\n\nI'll be honest with no backlight, I generally replace most common component failures instead of testing as it's just quicker.\n\nBut this one doesn't want to play ball.\n\nComponents changed:\n\n- FB Resistors (R7708\/9)\n- LED Driver (U7701)\n- LCD Connector\n- Both mosfets (Q7706 incl. resistors for v. divider) + (Q7701)\n\nThe odd thing is that on the SW lines I get 0v so Q7701 mosfet is not opening. R7703 is not blown, checking the voltage at pins 1 and 2 of LED driver I get 0.01v.\n\nAny ideas on why that might be?\n\nThere is also no short on backlight output.\n\nThanks\nJamie"
