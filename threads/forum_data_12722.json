        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U5420": "What is U5420? a CHIP.",
        "U5421": "What is U5421? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "R7050": "What is R7050? Current sense shunt resistor for the battery, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 17/18 on ISL6259 should give you 2.02 ohms. .",

No liquid to SMC area or clock area. No liquid to <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> directly. Fan spins for half a second, turns off, ad infinitum. \n\n- <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 14.24v\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.45v\n- resistance between pins 17/18 is 4.13Mohm (which is of course way too high)\n- resistance between pins 27/28 is 19.5ohm\n- pin 3 of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> is 3.96v\n- board runs with battery connected (and with battery/charger connected)\n\n<RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR>/52 measure properly, but I replaced them to be safe. No change. <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> measures properly. Replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>, no change. What could be causing the resistance of pins 17/18 to be so high? Could it be <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR>? Would the board still power on and run fine with battery if <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> were at fault?\n\nThanks in advance!"
