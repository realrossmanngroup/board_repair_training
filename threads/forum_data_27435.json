    "definitions": {
        "820-2850": "What is 820-2850? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC? SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC is a voltage that is created if SMC_BC_ACOK & PP3V42_G3H are both present that powers the chipset for the onewire circuit that allows the SMC to talk to the charger on the SYS_ONEWIRE line. This is necessary for the magsafe charger to have a light on it. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "SLP_S4": "What is SLP_S4? a SIGNAL.",
        "ADPATER_SENSE": "What is ADPATER_SENSE? This is a typo of ADAPTER_SENSE When you see ADPATER_SENSE, assume they meant to type ADAPTER_SENSE.",
        "U6900": "What is U6900? a CHIP.",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. ."
