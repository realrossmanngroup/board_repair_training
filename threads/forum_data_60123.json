            "message": "As it's my first post on this forum I want to say hello to all members! \n\nI'm fighting with a kind of odd case of <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, board number <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. Board looks perfectly clean, untouched, no water signs, no damages, even no dust on it. Customer claims, that computer just turned off by itself and stopped charging. \n\nFirst measurements:\n\n- no 20v on charger, stuck at 5v\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> 2,5v (no short,  0,337v in diode mode) \n- <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 0,115v (no short, 0,386v in diode mode)\n \nI've noticed <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> and SMC were getting hot (SMC was warmer), so replaced <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> first. No results, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> still at 2,5v. Later I've replaced SMC from the same board which has brought <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> back to 3,3v, <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> not getting hot anymore too. Board switched to 20v 0,039A on charger, but still not powering on. Weirdly, when I was heating up the area around SMC, the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> raised to 13v and board booted taking around 1A. After connecting screen I had logo with progress bar, but before it loaded fully, board cooled down and turned off. I thought it's just bad soldering, so I pulled SMC, reballed and put it back. No changes, but this time it takes much longer for board to swicth to 20v or sometimes it stays at 5v 0,05A. Now heating SMC area doesn't make it to \"boot\" like before. When it takes 20v anyway there is no PPBUS.\n\n- Here are basic voltages I'm getting (diod modes in brackets)\n\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3,3v (0,334)\n- <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XA</SIGNAL>/XB - 20v or sometimes stuck at 5v (0,158)\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_XA</SIGNAL>/XB - 3,3v\n- PPBUS G3H - 0,037v (0,385)\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> - 0v obviously, there is no PPBUS (0,345/0,398)\n\n- readings around <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> (I've replaced it just in case):\n\npin 1 - 20v  (0,381)\npin 2 - 0,037v (0,515)\npin 3 - 20v (0,510)\n\n <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR>: both sides reads 0,037v, resistance OK.\n\n- <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> replaced twice, here are readings around:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_G3H_P3V3H3H</SIGNAL> - 20v\n<SIGNAL>TBA_CSIR_N</SIGNAL> - 20v\n<SIGNAL>TBA_CSIR_P</SIGNAL> - 20v\n<SIGNAL>TBA_COMP</SIGNAL> - 1,15v\n<SIGNAL>TBA_LX1</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>TBA_BOOT1</SIGNAL> - 4,86v\n<SIGNAL>TBA_VDDP</SIGNAL> - 5,15v\n<SIGNAL>TBA_VDDP</SIGNAL> - 5,15v\n<SIGNAL>TBA_BOOT2</SIGNAL> - 4,92v\n\ncurrent sense: \n\n<SIGNAL>TBA_CSIR_P</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>TBA_CSIR_N</SIGNAL> - 2,5ohm\n<SIGNAL>TBA_CSOR_P</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>TBA_CSOR_N</SIGNAL> - 2,7ohm\n\nother readings: \n\n<SIGNAL>TBA_HPWR_EN_L</SIGNAL> - 3,38v (resistance OK)\n<SIGNAL>BUF_SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 3,40v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA</SIGNAL> - 3,4v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_WAKE_L</SIGNAL> - 3,1v (shold be low, right?)\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC</SIGNAL> - 1,20v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V0_S5_AVREF_SMC</SIGNAL> - 3,0v\n\n\nAll resistors around SMC checked, nothing is missing, values are correct. Voltages at <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> not present, but I think it's because PPBUS is missing. Do you have any suggestions? Can it be bad SMC again?"

The interesting thing is, when the board is stuck at 5v it’s enough to delicately press the SMC and voltage gets up to 20v and stays like that. I’ve reflowed SMC, but with no changes. Maybe there is structural damage in SMC? Or broken trace in pcb?"

            "message": "Reflashing EFI did the trick, computer starts now, loads system. Now I have 2 other problems:\n\n- I've changed the fsys region in bios you sent me with the original bios fsys (I've copied everything from this region) but S/N doesn't show up in \"this mac\" info, also when I want to run diagnostics it shows me, that mac doesn't have S/N, and I can't perform diagnostics.\n\n- keyboard doesn't work at all. With external keyboard it works fine, but internal doesn't react even for power button. Can it be related to bad SMC or bad soldering? I don't have another keyboard or topcase to replace it.\n\nEDIT: I've edited bios you sent me and replaced S/N only. Now diagnostics works, S/N is visible in \"this mac\", also keyboard works perfectly. I think without S/N board wasn't able to identify itself and that's why keyboard was off.\n\nComputer is repaired, [USER=682]@2informaticos[/USER], as always thank you for support! If not damaged SMC which I have used for the first time it would be repaired earlier. What to do, in such market situation sometimes we have to cope with damaged components from donor boards..."

I guess there is an editor, which recalculates new values to be the same with original one?"
