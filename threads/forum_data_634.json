            "message": "So, this is the same 2011 15\" computer. Have it running \"fine\" however, after I was about to run tests on the board, I touched the Broadcom BCM57765B0 chip and it is boiling hot. Actually at first, I touched the other side of the board, behind the BCM chip and couldn't figure out why some components were getting very hot, with no rhyme or reason. Then I felt the other side of the board (had to remove the speaker assembly, then it was obvious)\n\nSo my question is... do I try to replace that chip, or do i just remove it from the machine entirely? On the schematic, it even says \"OMIT\" above <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>, what does that infer? Looks like it is the SD card reader/LAN IC (which I don't care about so much Card Reader or LAN)\n\nIf I were to \"remove\" this chip from the board, what would one recommend? This has around 70 \"pins\" and would seem to be a beast to remove/reinstall... which I am willing to try, but...\n\nAny way. If it were you, what would you do and how would you go about doing \"it\"?\n\nThanks again!!!\n\n**** JUST looked up the BC57765 and it is the Card reader IC, and LAN***"
