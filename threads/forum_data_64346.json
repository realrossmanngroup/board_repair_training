        "message":"Hello,\n\nI got a MacBook Air 2020 M1 13i A2337, logic board 820-02016, able to boot, and works properly if I plug an external monitor and close the lid.\n\nHowever, there is no way to see anything on the macbook air's screen itself; it stays black.\n\nI measured CP860, pin 1, it goes up to 357mV, then down to 352mV, and fluctuates in this range, instead of 48-50V as per the repair.wiki\nThe board is in its case, battery unplugged, bottom case obviously removed, lid open, and macbook upside down.\nI did not find any short in the PPVOUT_LCDBKLT area; CP860 to CP866; DP800; LP800.\n\nI did the same measurement on CP860 but without the screen plugged in, and got the exact same values (357mV, then fluctuates from 352 to 357mV)\n\nSo, screen undetected. Owner said the screen stopped working suddenly while in use. \n\nNext step, test with a known good screen I assume? Will have to source that, as I usually work on older machines"
