Took out the motherboard and no green light now. a few questions if you could please answer.\n1- Does the Magsafe charger has a right way to plug in? Its not keyed so can be plugged in any which way!\n2- What are the voltage levels on the Charger?\n3- This board A1229  <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2132</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> is supposed to have 18.5v in <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. I measure 16.5v. Does this mean the Magsafe is inadequate? If so can I test with 18.5 Power Injection?\n4- Have purchased a boardview file for this from appleschematics.com. I also have a PDF with matching numbers. There are transistors in both which are not present on the board. There is not even a place for it. It was not taken out. Just wondering if I have the right boardview file. How do I know I have the correct boardview file and where do I get just the one I need? Don't want to buy the whole pack just yet.\n5- Louis does not have tutoring anymore. Is there any place which does?\n\nThanks in advance for your attention."

Also it's easy to have bad contact in the Magsafe port with old machines, and in the FFC connector between LIO board and logic board.\n1/ Magsafe can be plugged in both ways. If you don't have at least some experience with these machines I'd not recommend trying to jump straight into board repair.\n2/ It depends on the Magsafe. This board requires a Magsafe1 85W which can send out 18.5V but it can also decrease the voltage a little bit when idling, and it'll only send out 6V when not connected to the machine.\n3/ <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> should be somewhere around 12.6V as usual.\n4/ No sure why you'd pay for schematics/boardviews when they're available for free.\nLike every logic boards, some components will not be populated because they're not necessary on production boards. They're annotated with NO STUFF or a BOM option that's not listed for production in the BOM option table.\n5/ I'd recommend watching Louis Rossmann videos as most of the information is readily available in them. There's also his repair guide and his wiki as well as other sources of information such as [URL]https://logi.wiki/[/URL] , badcaps.net and this forum."
