I got to a point where the KB is not working and I replaced a new one since that one was flooded. The power button works fine, but the rest of the kb is not. I get <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_KBD</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_4</SIGNAL>, and diode mode reading are good. \n\nAny suggestions, please?\nThanks :D"
