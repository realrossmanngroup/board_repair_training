If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed â€“ if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "HALL_SENSOR_LEFT": "What is HALL_SENSOR_LEFT? HALL_SENSOR_LEFT is a signal from the hall sensor on the left side of the machine that indicates that the lid has been closed. This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen.",

After all repairs were done and it booted all was ok except that fan start to spin for 2-3 seconds with very high revolutions and than stop. Do it 4-5 times and than fan stops. Every time fan start to spin it spin max. revolucion than stop spin, stop, spin stop,. \n\n\nI already checked all <RESISTOR>R4800</RESISTOR> <TRANSISTOR>Q4800</TRANSISTOR> zone and it all is ok. \n\n\nAny idea?"

Checked trackpad and seems to be ok.\n\n\nP.S. tried new trackpad and new flex and same. Onboard connector is ok and seems that Volts arriving also are ok. As the issue is \"sometimes happenning\" i cant find what exactly make trackpad fail. THe only thing i noticed is that when i close the macbook and it sleeps, after wake up about 20-30 second trackpad stuck and work, after that 30 seconds it's all ok."
