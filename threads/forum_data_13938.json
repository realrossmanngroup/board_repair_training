        "A1278": "What is A1278? A1278 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook or Macbook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2254, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2327, 820-2530, 820-2879, 820-2936, 820-3115..",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",

        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

Occasionally the charger is recognized and shows a green then orange light and will charge the battery, BUT 90% of the time the charger is not recognized at all and there is no green light.\n\nThe board has no signs of liquid damage, orange high temp spots, corrosion of any kind, etc... visually the board looks almost new.\n\nI've already replaced the battery (just to be sure), the magsafe board, and tried with different original apple chargers. Everything has the same results.  I've tried with the battery unplugged as well and get pretty much the same results. \n\nOn the few occasions where it does recognize the charger it sometimes has a very faint flicker on the orange light like it's straining.\n\nAlso if someone has the boardview & schematic file for this board that would be very kind of you too :)\n\nAny assistance would be appreciated."

Nothing when off and nothing when connecting the charger (Yes, I did try with several original Apple chargers), and nothing when starting from battery.  I repeated this test with and without the battery plugged in just to be sure.  Same results.\n\nIt did do something odd today when running these tests.  At one point the charger gave me  a green light and triggered turned on the board and it started to boot.  I disconnected the charger and it shut off.  After that it wouldn't power on with the battery installed.  The battery meter on the side showed nothing as if the battery wasn't connected.  It's has always worked during these tests.  I disconnected the battery and plugged it back in and still no power level meter function or ability to start up on battery power.  I unplugged the battery for about a solid minute then plugged it back in and now it's working normally off the battery again.  Just to be sure I replaced the battery with a new original apple battery but had the same results during the time it wouldn't power on from battery alone."

Reset the SMC (again) and now for some magic reason that totally escapes me it's working normally now.  Honestly I don't know what combination of things , if anything I did at all fixed this but it's back to normal now and in 2 days of testing it randomly with different chargers, firing it up, putting it to sleep, rebooting, etc... it's functioning 100% normal.  Thanks everyone for the help & input."
