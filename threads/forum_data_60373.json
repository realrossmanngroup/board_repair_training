Lots of minor blue everywhere.\ncomponents around u3100 has minor corrosion. u7650 looks like it might have been hit the hardest.\nWhen plugged in I get 5.12v-5.16v on each port. No amps.\n\nLooking around u7650 I noticed PPVIN_G3H_P5VG3S had .02v to ground. Traced it back to u7600. Replaced that and short was gone. Plugged in the board and had 5v with .3 amps then 19.8v with 0 amps. Checked a different port and it was back to 5v 0 amps. Checked  PPVIN_G3H_P5VG3S again and back to .04v to ground.\nShort is on pins 6,7,8 of u7600. so something on PP5V_G3S at .016v. Removed r5410 to confirm not on PPBUS_G3H.\n\nThe only thing with serious corrosion on PP5V_G3S was pin 22 of j5100. Removed connector and 4 connecting caps but no change.\n\nSafe to inject PP5V_G3S??"
