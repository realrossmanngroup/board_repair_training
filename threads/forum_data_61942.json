I can get it into DFU mode and it acts like it's recovering then resets.\nI can put it into recovery and select my wifi.   and it will stay on as long as I leave it there but if I enter the wifi and continue it starts to load then resets.\n\nIt is almost like a power FET CPU issue not sure.  All the rails are fine until it resets.\n\nAny ideas from experience on this one?"
