I am currently using a fresh port and getting 0.137A\n\nI do not have the board view or schematics for this board. There also appears to be no visible corrosion\/signs of liquid damage.\nNo voltage on any of the inductors, the CD3215 that I've plugged the board into outputs 3.25V 5V 1V 0.9V on the caps around it\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nI have attached thermal pictures of the board. Front and backside of the only hot spot and one of the whole thing."}
