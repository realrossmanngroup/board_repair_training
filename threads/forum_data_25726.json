This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

I have an ISL from another board on the there with jumpers made.\nI get a green light, no orange light and laptop won’t power on.\n\n\nNow to answr the questions.\nResitance over pin 17/18 is 1.6k ohms.\nPin 27/28 is 20.3 ohms\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.5v with charger plugged in 11.3v battery only\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is back and 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.4v\nBattery indicator is working\n<CAPACITOR>C1802</CAPACITOR> is 3.4v as is <CAPACITOR>C1803</CAPACITOR>\n\nAnd there you go. Just found <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> all over the place. It  drops from 3 to 0 and everything in between. \n\nGoing to go look at that now. Thanks for the questions Duke.

I have pretty much given up on this though, it's a mind fucking rabbits hole I've concluded.\n\n<CHIP>U7000</CHIP> isn't even on the board, neither is <CAPACITOR>C7050</CAPACITOR>, <RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR> or <RESISTOR>R7052</RESISTOR>. <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> is also off the board.\n\nWhen I touched ground and pin 2 pad of <RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7052</RESISTOR> it would beep. When I touched on <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> and ground it would also beep. Something else has obviously happened since I took those measurements, as even the other side of F7040 beeps now.. I figured the line is shorted inside the board layers so I cut the via's to the pads on <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR>,<RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR>,<RESISTOR>R7052</RESISTOR>. Pads no longer beep. I start putting it all back together with jumpers and notice that those lines beep to ground again. WTF. This whole time I'm also testing against another board (although dead) and having different and as expected results.\n\nCurrently there is no <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> on the board or <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR>. Nothing beeps to ground in that area anymore. I put <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> back on, it beeps. I take it off it doesn't, I take one from another board, test continuity of <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> before putting on and no beep. Put it on, touch ground and it beeps. Take it off and pads don't beep but <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> now does. \n\nAnd that was it. I went home for the night. I have 12 iPhone touch ic's waiting for me in the morning. May as well stick to what I know, doubt I'll be looking at it again. I reckon that 'mistake' fucked it big time. It only cost me $40 anyway.\n\nCheers"
