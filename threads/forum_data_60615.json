Changed dcin port multiple different ones as that seemed the obvious likely issue. Checked resistance in lines from DCIn. Replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> same symptoms. Not sure what is causing the intermittent issue. UsuallyIf I leave on the charger long enough the voltage will slowly build and the board wil turn on. Once on it stays on. Something inconsistently allowing charger to send voltage. No intermittent shorts on main rails that I can detect.\nI am testing with known working 85W charger."
