This board works fine on charger with no battery installed. \nWith a charged battery and no charger it also boots and works fine. \nWhen battery is installed and you plug charger in, the icon says not charging the battery briefly then shows no charger connected, light flashes constantly until battery removed. Light then shows green then orange. \n\nReplaced u7100\nq7130\nq7155\n\nChanged a whole bunch of resistors around u7100 that were marginally out of spec and probably didn\u2019t need changing.\n\npins 27\/28 measure 20ohms\npins 17\/18 measure 2.6ohms\nvoltage at pin 2,19 and 20 of u7100\ntried new battery\nppvbat_g3h_conn pin 5 is 16.1v no battery connected. Is 7.4v with battery \nr5422 and r5431 in spec\nacok is 3.4v\n\nAny advice appreciated."}
