        "message":"Hello, \n\nI got this Macbook A1398 820-00163-A came in with charging issue , I have founds a short   PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR , I proceeded to replace Q7130 AND Q7135 As well as R7120  and U7100 to rule out the overall issue  then short was gone , but now i am having issues  , its only charging when screen is on , but as soon as it  goes to sleep mode , its not charging but the orange light is still present and also while the charger is plugged anytime we open a website or trying to do something , it would charge and cut off then restart charging again but as soon as it goes sleep mode it would not stop charging immediately . Can i get some ideas please ? \n\nThank you"
