        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",

        "C1950": "What is C1950? Capacitor between PP3V42_G3H & ground on pin 8 of U1950 on 2013-2015 Macbook Pros & Airs that often corrodes. When corroded, pin 8 on U1950 will be damaged, which will prevent machine from booting and cause PM_SLP_S4_L to pulse. .",

        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

There was a short on Pin 2 of L7095(<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>) and I tracked it down to the <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> so I replaced it and the short was gone.\nFor some reason though when I measure <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> I only get around 0.9v but as soon as I touch Pin 1 of L7095 <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> goes to around 4.6v. When I initially plug the charger in Pin 1 of L7095 usually shows voltage anywhere from 4.3v to 4.6v and one time it showed 3.1v.\nPin 1 of L7095 is almost always around 4v when I measure after plugging in the charger. Pin 2 of L7095 usually fluctuates around 0.91v to 1v when I initially measure but as soon as I touch Pin 1 and measure again it jumps to around 4v. I have never seen this issue where Pin 2 is a certain voltage and it changes once Pin 1 is touched.\n\nI get 0v on <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and I figure that is because <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is not a steady 3.42v. Could it be that the <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> chip I replaced with is bad as well?\n\nDiode mode of L7095 - 0.35v\nDiode mode of <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 0.47v"
