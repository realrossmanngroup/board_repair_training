This thing has been at another repair guy, it came with <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> missing from the board. I replaced those and then did the testing with the wrong adapter... With the right adapter, its working almost fine. Dont know why the other repair guy took the IC's off.\n\nTwo issues remained: cardreader didnt work because of a broken trace in the board somewhere, fixed that with a jumper.\nThere was a crack in the board at one USB port. I fixed all connections across the break with jumpers, making it work normally with usb 2 sticks.\nHowever, USB 3 sticks are not detected most of the time and dont work properly when they are detected. I went over the cracked connections three times now, but everything is in order. I followed the rails across the board and found no problem, but cant check whats under the PCH.\nThe other port is functional with usb 3 sticks, but the macbook will hang on a black screen if left on for a little while. When booting from internal drive, this doesnt happen.."
