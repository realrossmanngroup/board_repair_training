Or a datasheet for the chip (SLG3NB148CV)?  \n\nthanks\nJustin \n\np.s. yes -- took the thing off, stopped for a cup of tea and then realised i didn't make a note.  and matching the dot with pin 1 on the boardview just doesn't look right in my memory!"

            "message": "top left is an ambiguous concept here John!   \n\nbut if there is confidence in the dot and confidence in the boardview pin 1 notation then I guess that it's my mind playing tricks on me and the chip is oriented correctly.  It look jarringly wrong vis a vis my memory of when I removed it.\n\nAs luck would have it I got a very similar board (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3427</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A) in the door 20 minutes ago, so I will cross-fingers and hope that it has a similar component set for RTC and double check against that! \n\nthanks"
