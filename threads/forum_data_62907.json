        "message":"This A1708 arrived dead with liquid damage. I diagnosed a bad CD3215, which I replaced. Everything is now functional except the webcam.\n\nI tried 3 different display assemblies and display cables... no camera. Interestingly, Apple Diagnostics does NOT report any issues with the camera, but  System Report says \"No video capture devices\".\n\nAmbient Light Sensor is fully functional. No green camera LED. I checked all 8 inductors on the MIPI_CLK and MIPI_DATA lines, they are all good.\n\nDuring the board's power-up sequence I get all camera power rails (CAMERA_PWR_EN, PP1V2_CAM,PP1V35_CAM,PP1V8_CAM). When I try to access the camera (Photo Booth app), CAMERA_PWR_EN goes high for half a second, then back to zero and the app reports \"There is no connected camera\".\n\nAnything else I could try before assuming that the camera chip U3900 or the SMC is damaged?"
