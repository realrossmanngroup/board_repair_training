The fan will spin and slowly ramp up until it fully ramps to max speed. This only happens with the battery. Without the battery, the board never powers up or doesn't pull any current. With battery connected, current draw is present. History on this board is it had corrosion buildup at and around U7100, U7700. Ran through ultrasonic clean and it looks good again. But still having the same no power issue (fan still spins with battery)\n\nAny suggestion?"}
