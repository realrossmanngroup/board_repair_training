Boots fine with good video but will not recognize keyboard, trackpad, or drive.\n\nAll voltages good on KB connector SMC_ONOFF__L signal is High (not sure if that is good or bad)\n\npower to USB ports, makes a bootable thumb drive flash but will not boot to it.\n\nu4500 has good supply voltages and is enabled\nSata connector has good voltages\n\nThoughts on where to proceed? Not sure what all 3 have in common other than they feed the same chip.\n\nthx, Paul"}
