I ended up realizing that g3h was shorted to ground in diode mode and when I removed L7130 the short was only on Pin 2 side so I tracked it down to a couple of capacitors that were next to the cpu. I put the coil on and still no change in voltage on ppbus g3h.  I checked again and saw that L7130 was shorted to ground and when I removed it the short was gone for some reason. \nI put two more L7130s from donor boards and each time I put them on the short appears.\n\nThis is something I haven't seen before so do you know what else could be causing this.
