I ended up realizing that g3h was shorted to ground in diode mode and when I removed L7130 the short was only on Pin 2 side so I tracked it down to a couple of capacitors that were next to the cpu. I put the coil on and still no change in voltage on ppbus g3h.  I checked again and saw that L7130 was shorted to ground and when I removed it the short was gone for some reason. \nI put two more L7130s from donor boards and each time I put them on the short appears.\n\nThis is something I haven't seen before so do you know what else could be causing this. I already replaced F7140 and that measures fine."}

I'm thinking all the heat on the board was messing up my measurements.\n\nAnyways, now I get 8.59v on ppbus but I am not getting voltages on other rails.\nPP5v_s5 pulses initially at 5v then just stays at 1.71v. I have 0v and no pulses on PM_SLP_S4_L and PP3v3_s5. There are discolered probe points around the bios chip and u1900 but the components all look good.\n\nAlso, I replaced the ISL6259 and the current sense resistors yesterday."}
