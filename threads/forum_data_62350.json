Has green\/amber light but no fan spin, 20mA from the power supply. Originally had some corrosion around U8130 and J6100 and the DC board and flex were destroyed, replaced the board and flex and cleaned the corrosion, got green light back but same power draw.\n\nPPBUS_G3H 8.62v\nPP3V42_G3H 3.42v\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.34v\nPP5V_S5 5.01v\nPP3V3_S5 3.35v\n\nPM_BATLOW_L 3.3v\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN 3.43v\nPM_DSW_PWRGD 3.43v\nPCH_DSWVRMEN 3.23v \n\n[B]PP3V3_SUS 0v\nP3V3SUS_EN 0v[\/B]\n\nRTC_RESET_L 3.34v\nPCH_SRTCRST_L 3.34v\nPCH_INTRUDER_L 3.05v\nPCH_INTVRMEN 3.25v\n\nAny suggestions?
