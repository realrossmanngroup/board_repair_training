        "message":"This board had liquid damage to the entire area DCIN\/3v42 of this board: from C7098,L7095 area through D7012, ALL of those components have been replaced. This board boots from PS input but not from original 85W charger. \n\nOn original charger:\nPPDCIN_G3H  is around 1.5V most of the time\nDiode mode there is 0.5\nI've replace D7012 twice, ISL twice, Q7180 3x (last time I did Q7180 at same time as ISL just in case), Replaced Q7010 twice\nResistors i've checked that measure good: R7005\/6, R7010\/1\/2, R7180\/1\/5\/6, R7105, R7010\/1\nREsistance between pins 17\/18 of ISL is 2.1 ohms,  27\/28 pins 20 ohms.\n\nOnce briefly after replacing ISL the board started but I believe this was shortly after having on power supply so not sure if that was related.\n\nAny thoughts? I feel like I've replaced everything I could think of for typical leakage cause at least once."

Unfortunately I don't know what the other problem that got solved ultimately got the board working. Must've been something that was blowing the Q7180's that I eventually replaced. \n\nThis one was a nightmare so not worth fixing but I can't NOT fix a charging issue haha!"
