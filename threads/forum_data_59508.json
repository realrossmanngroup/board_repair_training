        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",

This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded.."

When I connect it to the magsafe 2 (original magsafe 2 85watts, no adapter 1->2) I get a green light, and then it turns orange, no fan or chime...\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.60\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>= 3.42\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>= 3.3v\n\nIn adition to this, and because I got stuck diagnosing this board, can you please help me sending me a document or link to the  explanation of the power on sequence on the macbooks? I can fix back light, ISL issues and some others, but this is the 3rd month I am using the forum and I really dont think I have learned a lot from it, I really want this to work, but I need help to learn this stuff... thank you..."
