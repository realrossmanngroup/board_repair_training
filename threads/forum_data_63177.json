And we have bought a new I\/O board for the device. When we put the board into the case and connect everything we saw that the fan starts for a second then goes off and device too.\n\nThen we took the board out from the case and put the charger on again under the thermal camera, and found out that Q7080 is flashing under the thermal. \n\nThought that it might be charger problem and tried another one but the problem is still same. \n\nAny ideas about what it could be ?"}

I found out that on Q7630 I can read the 8.4V on 1st and 2nd leg. But on other legs the voltage jumps from 0.00 to different voltages on each leg.\n\nI dont know where else I need to start to  look at it to be honest."}
