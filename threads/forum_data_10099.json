        "message":"Hi there! I have an 820-3332-A    which was dead because of water damage, I removed the visible corrosion with a toothbrush and alcohol (yes I know). It works perfectly except there's no sound and no backlight on the keyboard. \nIn system preferences under sound it shows no input or output devices. The ambient light sensor does work for the screen, and it shows that you can adjust brightness of the keyboard once the ambient light sensor is covered. but there's no light. \nI have my board view and schematic ready. Although I have watched just about every one of Louis's videos, this is the first time I'm attempting to diagnose a board issue on a MacBook. \nI would so very greatly appreciate any help I can get :) \nthank you"
