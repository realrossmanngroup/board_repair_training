I'm not having any luck at all finding schematics and board view for this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A so I wanted to ask if anyone knows if this is available anywhere or if it's just not out in the wild yet. I know this forum isn't for sharing these documents and I'm not asking for someone to provide the documents, I just want to know if I should stop trying to find it if that makes sense.\n\nDoes anyone know if there are schematics for a different logic board that are similar enough to be useful?\n\nCheers,\n\nAlex"
