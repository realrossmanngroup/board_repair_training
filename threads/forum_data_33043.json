The logic board has some liquid damage. I'm not having any luck at all finding schematics and board view for this 820-00928-A so I wanted to ask if anyone knows if this is available anywhere or if it's just not out in the wild yet. I know this forum isn't for sharing these documents and I'm not asking for someone to provide the documents, I just want to know if I should stop trying to find it if that makes sense.\n\nDoes anyone know if there are schematics for a different logic board that are similar enough to be useful?\n\nCheers,\n\nAlex"}

All circuit design is very similar between models but you have to figure out what is what."}

The 820-00281 schematic and board view are the closest things I could find that is similar enough to be useful for troubleshooting."}
