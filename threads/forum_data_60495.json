Eventually it got to the point where it would chime on re-boot, but the lcd would show no image.\n\nTried re-soldering\/replacing U8900, then when that didn't help, realized I needed to stop guessing and start analyzing.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that I knocked off several components around U8900 (I know, rookie mistake - didn't have the air turned down enough)  After I replaced those, I checked for the GPU power rails from sheet 88 of the schematic and measured the following:\n\nP3V3GPU - 1.3 millivolts\nP1V8GPU - 1.805 volts\nGPUVCORE - 0.0 millivolts\nP1V35GPUFB - 0.0 millivolts\nP1V05_S0GPU - 0.0 millivolts\n\nI could use a clue to understand how to troubleshoot the different power rails.\n\nWith the board out of the chassis, connecting the power adapter, the light comes on, fans spin up and over the course of 2 minutes or so, gradually go from low speed to high speed, and pretty loud.  Not sure if that is normal."}

I measured at pin 1 of R1600, which I see now is associated with the CPU power rail, not for GPU.\n\nI did go and check the following enable signals for GPU at the resistors around U9100 - and the signals are all not there.  Wouldn't these be present when the bare board is powered up?  Or are they just momentary after the board first starts?\n\nP3V3GPU_EN at R9121 - 1.0 millivolts\nP1V8GPU_EN at R9122 - 1.0 millivolts\nGPUVCORE_EN at R9123 - 1.0 millivolts\nP1V35GPUFB_EN at R9124 - 1.0 millivolts\nP1V05_S0GPU_EN at R9125 - 1.1 millivolts\n\nI also confirmed USB activity on a bootable flash drive."}

Thanks!\n\nI have again checked U8900 and surrounding components.  I have made diode-mode measurements for each pin, and compared to a known good board.  I previously found a bad R8900 this way, and replaced it.  I have a few other maybe-bad\/maybe-not-bad readings I'm not sure what to make of, if it would help.\n\npin 16 - 5.00 \npin 17 - 12.53\npin 25 - 5.00\npin 38 - 0.001 (my MM reads 1.0 millivolts)"}
