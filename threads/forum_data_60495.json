A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",

Eventually it got to the point where it would chime on re-boot, but the lcd would show no image.\n\nTried re-soldering/replacing <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>, then when that didn't help, realized I needed to stop guessing and start analyzing.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was that I knocked off several components around <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> (I know, rookie mistake - didn't have the air turned down enough)  After I replaced those, I checked for the GPU power rails from sheet 88 of the schematic and measured the following:\n\nP3V3GPU - 1.3 millivolts\nP1V8GPU - 1.805 volts\nGPUVCORE - 0.0 millivolts\nP1V35GPUFB - 0.0 millivolts\n<SIGNAL>P1V05_S0GPU</SIGNAL> - 0.0 millivolts\n\nI could use a clue to understand how to troubleshoot the different power rails.\n\nWith the board out of the chassis, connecting the power adapter, the light comes on, fans spin up and over the course of 2 minutes or so, gradually go from low speed to high speed, and pretty loud.  Not sure if that is normal."

I measured at pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R1600</RESISTOR>, which I see now is associated with the CPU power rail, not for GPU.\n\nI did go and check the following enable signals for GPU at the resistors around <CHIP>U9100</CHIP> - and the signals are all not there.  Wouldn't these be present when the bare board is powered up?  Or are they just momentary after the board first starts?\n\n<SIGNAL>P3V3GPU_EN</SIGNAL> at <RESISTOR>R9121</RESISTOR> - 1.0 millivolts\n<SIGNAL>P1V8GPU_EN</SIGNAL> at <RESISTOR>R9122</RESISTOR> - 1.0 millivolts\n<SIGNAL>GPUVCORE_EN</SIGNAL> at <RESISTOR>R9123</RESISTOR> - 1.0 millivolts\nP1V35GPUFB_EN at <RESISTOR>R9124</RESISTOR> - 1.0 millivolts\n<SIGNAL>P1V05_S0GPU_EN</SIGNAL> at <RESISTOR>R9125</RESISTOR> - 1.1 millivolts\n\nI also confirmed USB activity on a bootable flash drive."
