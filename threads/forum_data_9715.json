        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_ACOK": "What is CHGR_ACOK? This is identical to SMC_BC_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

After trying a different battery no more green light on charger. checked pp3v42 is present but no <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL>. Checked  <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> for <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>CHGR_CIN</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V1_CHGR_VDD</SIGNAL> all are present with no short to ground on <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL>. Im guessing some how the untested battery i plugged in may have cooked the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> somehow.\n\nany suggestions?"
