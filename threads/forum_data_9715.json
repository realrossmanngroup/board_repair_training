        "message":"i've got this 820-3462 here that originally did not recognize the battery after liquid damage. After trying a different battery no more green light on charger. checked pp3v42 is present but no CHGR_ACOK. Checked  U7000 for CHGR_ACIN, CHGR_CIN, SMC_RESET_L, PP5V1_CHGR_VDD all are present with no short to ground on CHGR_ACOK. Im guessing some how the untested battery i plugged in may have cooked the U7000 somehow.\n\nany suggestions?"
