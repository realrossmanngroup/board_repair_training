        "message":"A1226 comes with daid gpu. I replaced with g84-603-A2\nIt works only 2 weeks then no video. When heated it works again, so I replaced it with new one again. This time another provider Golden Chipset. It works only 3 weeks again and daid again. I talked with Golden Chipsets and they told me that what I order is 64bits and if I put to laptop 128 bits this kill the gpu. I have bought more then 50 other ati, nvidia gpus from Golden and all works. Never had a problem.\nBut this macbook pro has some other problems or I need to put really 128 bits. Any idea about this?\n2 gpus - 2,3 weeka each."
