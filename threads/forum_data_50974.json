        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",

            "message": "Hi, I have a 4924 without orange light. No power going to <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>. I have no shorts on <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> Pin 2 & 3 but 1 gives OL. Measured some other boards i have lying around, they all show OL on pin one so maybe its normal? I got 16.5v on pin 2 of F7005. All resistor around <TRANSISTOR>Q7020</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7010</TRANSISTOR> measure OK. <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> measured 44 instead 47 so I just replaced it for good measure now shows 47. Now every time we connect power smoke comes out of <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR>, 16.5v goes in 3.3v comes out. We replaced 4 of them all the same. We also replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7010</TRANSISTOR> as it had some crack in it, now we changed it like 3 x and still we have a bit of some coming out of <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> and voltage dropping to 3.3v. <CAPACITOR>C7020</CAPACITOR> also OK no short on pin 1. Also replaced <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> 3 x. Any ideas as I ran out of them :P\n\nEdit: using original 60w charger"
