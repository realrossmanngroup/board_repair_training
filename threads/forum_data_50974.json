        "message":"Hi, I have a 4924 without orange light. No power going to U7090. I have no shorts on D7005 Pin 2 & 3 but 1 gives OL. Measured some other boards i have lying around, they all show OL on pin one so maybe its normal? I got 16.5v on pin 2 of F7005. All resistor around Q7020 and Q7010 measure OK. R7020 measured 44 instead 47 so I just replaced it for good measure now shows 47. Now every time we connect power smoke comes out of R7020, 16.5v goes in 3.3v comes out. We replaced 4 of them all the same. We also replaced Q7010 as it had some crack in it, now we changed it like 3 x and still we have a bit of some coming out of R7020 and voltage dropping to 3.3v. C7020 also OK no short on pin 1. Also replaced D7005 3 x. Any ideas as I ran out of them :P\n\nEdit: using original 60w charger"
