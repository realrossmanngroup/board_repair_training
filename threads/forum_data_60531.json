This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

Just stopped working.\n\n\nRandomly it is booting ( may boot 10 times without any problem), but some times when i press power button led 1 turns off. Already tried new power supply ( known good) but same result. Than i have to disconect cable, wait few seconds, connect and try again. No visible issue on logic board.\n\n\nAny idea?\n\n\nAlso changed <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> but same"
