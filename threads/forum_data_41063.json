(Most likely controller).\nFrom what I assume from your screenshot is that the controller is not being detected at all, which could be related to the controller itself but also due to broken internal traces (like PCIe) and resistors failing.\n\nVoltages of:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_S0SW_SSD</SIGNAL>?\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0SW_SSD_HOT</SIGNAL>?\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0SW_SSD_COLD</SIGNAL>?\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S0SW_SSD_HOT</SIGNAL>?\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S0SW_SSD_COLD</SIGNAL>?\n<SIGNAL>PP2V5_S0SW_SSD</SIGNAL>?\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_S1X</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_SSD</SIGNAL>?\n\n\nThese boards are a pain in the ass to work with and if these voltages all are OK you might be in for a hard time"
