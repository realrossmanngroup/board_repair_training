The board had already been worked (when I say worked I mean attacked with a hot poker). After a bit of digging and a lot of F*ing about clearing up everything that had already been done I found what the last guy had missed... I think.\n\nR7731 and R7732 on the feedback voltage divider to U7700 both measured 12.51k parallel resistance because of a short to ground on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT on the LVDS connector. After 4 hours, it was a short on the LVDS!\n\nAre the MacBook Pro retina and MacBook Air 2011+ LCD connectors the same? They do at least look and fit the same.\n\nThere is also no enable signal EDP_BKLT_PSR_EN coming from the PCH.\nAny info on this would be great please"}

Before fixing the backlight do you even have an image on the LCD? If the connector was shorted there is a good chance the LCD cable will be burned too."}
