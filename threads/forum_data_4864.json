            "message": "Hi.\n\n\nI have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3476</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board with no backlight. The board had already been worked (when I say worked I mean attacked with a hot poker). After a bit of digging and a lot of F*ing about clearing up everything that had already been done I found what the last guy had missed... I think.\n\n<RESISTOR>R7731</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7732</RESISTOR> on the feedback voltage divider to <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> both measured 12.51k parallel resistance because of a short to ground on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> on the LVDS connector. After 4 hours, it was a short on the LVDS!\n\nAre the MacBook Pro retina and MacBook Air 2011+ LCD connectors the same? They do at least look and fit the same.\n\nThere is also no enable signal <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_PSR_EN</SIGNAL> coming from the PCH.\nAny info on this would be great please"
