            "message": "This machine came in as \"no power\", history unknown.\nConnected to the PSU it drew a charge, fan would spin and CPU got warm. No POST or boot.\nTook it apart and found corrosion on <CAPACITOR>C0890</CAPACITOR> and C089, small spot. Cleaned it up and found one of the caps shorted to ground.\nReplaced both caps and unit sat there dead. No <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> which I traced back to <CHIP>U8020</CHIP> which sits right underneath the caps that were shorted. Replaced <CHIP>U8020</CHIP>.\nAt this point the MacBook was back to it's original behavior... fan spins, warm CPU, no POST etc.\nDid an SMC reset and it fired right up! Showing the login screen.\n\nGreat! I shut it down to put the Wi-Fi card in and booted it holding \"d\" key for a hardware test.\nback to original problem :mad:\n\nThought the battery looked a bit off, turns out to be a 3rd party, so grabbed an OEM KG battery to put in. Now unit draws no more than 0.800 amps and power cycles.\ntested this with two KG batteries, same bahavior. Just as I'm about to give up for the day I put the 3rd party battery back in. It went back to drawing a full charge and now it power cycles and plays half of the boot chime on a loop.\n\nDa hell... Before I spend tomorrow chasing my tail on this thing, any suggestions on where to look/what to look for? Apart from the small spot of corrosion the board was clean.\n\nAppreciate any help :)"
