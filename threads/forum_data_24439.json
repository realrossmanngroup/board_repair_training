But not really shut down, the backlight, keyboard light and USB all stay on with no picture, sometimes resetting it will still go back to this no picture state.\nRunning ASD with a Magsafe-2 I get no errors.\nRunning ASD with a genuine 85W Magsafe-1 with adapter I get a VDOR, IPBR and sensor below low point error and then it will jump into the no picture state. I can reliably get it to go into the no picture state with ASD and magsafe-1.\nFiguring its some kind of current sensing issue, any usual suspects to check out first?\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\tunnamed.jpg Views:\t1 Size:\t267.4 KB ID:\t24440\" type=\"full\" width=\"30%\"]24440._xfImport[\/ATTACH]\n\njust saw another post about this, will try R7021\/R7022 and update status."
