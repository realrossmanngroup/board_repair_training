Fan spins then stop loop.\n\n\nWhen checked voltages PP5V_S4 enable signal turning on and off, its come from SMC but i cant be sure why SMC defect suddenly. My brain burned any idea for start to check?\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.5V and stable\nPPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING = 12.5V and stable\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3.43V and stable\nPP5V_S5 = 5V and stable\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.3V and stable"

But when i didnt connect J9500 connector continue same issue.\nSo question is ; Could be damage U1100 (PCH) from USB data line, and my board problem is could be PCH ? Do you think i have to replace PCH ?"
