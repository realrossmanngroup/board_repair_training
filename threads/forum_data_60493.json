Powers on and boots now but having wifi issues.\n\nThere was corrosion  on the pins of J3501 After cleaning up J3501 pins wifi will work for a few minutes then turn itself off. After cleaning several times only to have wifi work for a few minutes before turning off again decided to removed J3501.\n\nThere was heavy corrosion on same of the pads. Now that the area is cleaned up what is a good method for soldering on replacement J3501?\n\nTried hot air a few times but the plastic keeps melting. Is there a certain temperature and airflow recommended?"}
