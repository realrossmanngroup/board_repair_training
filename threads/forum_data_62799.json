            "message": "Hi smart guys\n\nRecently I spilled beer on my old macbook and now want to fix it. I am a hardware designer and dont do repairs, so no experience in troubleshooting. Please, help me with it.\n\nSo <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1425</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> 13 inch Macbook Pro Retina. It was on when I spilled bear and it immediately shut itself off. Took me about an hour to get to home and teardown. I was surprised how much of green corrosion grew for such short time, most of corrosion was around INA current sensors and mosfets at top part of pcb (where air vents), some around components around smc but not much. After cleaning pcb visually all is ok and not much damage. I found a broken connection on one of INA, but no changes after fixing connection. I checked <CHIP>U5410</CHIP> and <CHIP>U5400</CHIP> where were most of corrosion and I see with osciloscope that they works fine. I also checked a few voltage sense circuits to make sure their signals goes all the way to smc.\n\nNo boot.\nGreen light on charger than switches to amber(no battery connected)\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12.56V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 3.09V (when I measure it in diferent parts of pcb I see slightly diferent voltage)\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.4V\n<SIGNAL>PPV5_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> and other S5 and G3Hs are good and present.\nAll others S0..S4 powerails are off but jumps to designed voltage every 5s for a 200ms pulse.\nI did not spot any damage component or short.\nFor me it feels like SMC tries to go to S0 state, but senses wrong voltage/current and shuts everything off, than cycle repeats in 5 seconds. Or it is indeed has a short circuit on one of sub rails.\n\nAny ideas what to check?\n\nThanks in advance."
