Had some corrosion on <CAPACITOR>C6100</CAPACITOR>, <RESISTOR>R5023</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C3890</CAPACITOR> replced then and resoldered the J9000 which also was with a bit of corrosion. Measured all voltages for the Ram looking good stable, but still the same when powered on. Any advice please?\n\nThanks"
