Diode mode reading is 0.00v.\nI restored <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> by replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q7310</TRANSISTOR>-7311-7320-7321. As I said before this board has been messed with already.\nUsing an original 60w magsafe 2 adapter i get a green light that turns amber as it should.\nUsing a dc power supply at 16.5V 4A , it shows a reading of 0.150A as soon as you plug the charger but it drops to 0.020 in a matter of seconds.\nI suppose that something is preventing it from starting.\nThere is nothing getting hot.\nThere is <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> but no <SIGNAL>PP3V_S5</SIGNAL>.\nI have checked everything corresponding to that line and everything seems in place. \nMy assumption is that a power line beyond that, meaning an s4 or s3 line is having an issue and that's why it is not powering up.\nI have also replaced <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>, and the smc from an excact same donor board."
