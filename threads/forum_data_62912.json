There is no light on the charger.\n\nChecking the voltages I have\nPPBUS_AON - 12V\nPP3v8_AON - 3.58V\nPP5v_S2_MAIN - 5V\nPP1V8_s1_CLVR_VDDH - 0v\n\n\nNot sure where to go from here given I cannot find any schematics for this model!"}

I've tried DFU revive and it doesn't even get detected so that's a no go. Do we know which voltage rail is required to be working on these M1's to get the charger switching to 20v?"}
