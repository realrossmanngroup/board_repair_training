There is no light on the charger.\n\nChecking the voltages I have\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> - 12V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL> - 3.58V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S2_MAIN</SIGNAL> - 5V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S1_CLVR_VDDH</SIGNAL> - 0v\n\n\nNot sure where to go from here given I cannot find any schematics for this model!"
