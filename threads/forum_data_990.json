When i checked voltage cant get ALL_SYS_PWRGD so cant get CPUVCORE.\n\nCan you help me?"}

Orange light doesn't mean it is charging the battery if PPBUS_G3H is too low! My guess is your PPBUS_G3H is 1.7v due to bad high side MOSFET on GPU buck converter."}

Yes orange light mean is charging battery ( when i connected battery its turning orange)  GPU is not too fast hot when i plug magsafe in one minute its warming up. PP1V5_S0 ,PP3V3_S5 and PP1V05_S0 is ok. I cant understand:("}

I see peoblem at pgood returns. For example P1V8S0_PGOOD is not present but i can measure L7720 1.8V and same thing is P5VS3_PGOOD not present but L7220 shows 5V. When i inject 3.3V at ALL_SYS_PWRGD fan starts to spin ( SMC reads that i think) but no VCORE."}

Sorry dukefawks you are right board dont have PPCPUVCCIO_S0_REG_R so its cant create PGOOD signals.\n\nThank you."}
