Found broken pins on J9000 connector. Replaced J9000 but now the backlight is very dim and flickering. Here are some measurements taken\n\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT - 27v (so replaced U9701). Still 27v\nLCD_BKLT_PWM 2.5v (i'm assuming this is suppose to be 3.4v, so replaced u9600 after checking for blown resistors or shorts). \nPPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR - 12.4v\nPP3V3_SW_LCD - 3.3v\nPP3V3_S0 - 3.3"}
