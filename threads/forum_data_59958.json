Replaced it and it stopped the bounce but PP3v42 was a little low and the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s were not talking to the charger and switching it to18v.   Current draw was 0.08A at 5v.  Thermal quickly identified the other <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> on the other side was also defective.   Regardless of port used it was the one sucking PP3v42 down slightly to 2.9-3.0v .   Replaced it and it and PP3V42 is now perfect.  Current draw is 0.02 it just sits at 5V and does not switch to 18v.   The CD3215C00's were replaced with the exact same part no the B03 versions.\n\nBoth defective <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s were on the same side of the board.   Should I just shotgun the ones on the other side?\n\nNo shorts on the power rails.  CPU / PCH are not shorted.\n\nIt has been about 6 months since I worked on these so I am just being a little lazy and looking for some guidance.\n\n\nThanks\nRandall"

            "message": "In my experience, when a <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> has a hole in it, the CPU/PCH is toast. I've had 3 or 4 boards that had the <CHIP>CD3125</CHIP>'s shorted so badly they burned a hole into the chip itself and fused the ball to the pad below it (I believe all shorted @<SIGNAL>3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>), and in all 3 cases, I resolved the short and CPU was killed. Look very hard at the CPU/PCH chipset; sometimes you can see the short/damage on the actual face/resin area. Looks like a tiny crack/brown spot...almost impossible to see without a microscope of course. Usually accompanied by a weird diode reading--i.e. .118 or similar. You'll sometimes notice the voltage is low and weird too, like 1.27v (so not STG)."

Plugging into the non damaged side I get the 1v1 LDO signal on both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s but the machine will still not swith to the 18v.   On the damaged side where both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s were replaced I do not get 1v1 LDO but the diode readings are the same as the non damaged side and appear normal.
