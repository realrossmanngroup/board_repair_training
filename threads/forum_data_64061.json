        "A1708": "What is A1708? A1708 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2017, 2016 with EMC 3164, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00840, 820-00875..",
        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN? EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is necessary to enable the power rail that powers the LCD screen image circuitry. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT is PPBUS_G3H backlight voltage entering the backlight boost circuit once the transistor has been told to allow it through. .",
        "BUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN": "What is BUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_F": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_F? a SIGNAL.",

        "DP_INT_HPD": "What is DP_INT_HPD? a SIGNAL.",
        "3V3_S0SW_LCD": "What is 3V3_S0SW_LCD? 3V3_S0SW_LCD is a 3.3v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state that powers the LCD screen image circuitry. This is necessary to get an image on the screen.",
        "EDP_INT": "What is EDP_INT? a SIGNAL.",
        "U8400": "What is U8400? a CHIP.",
