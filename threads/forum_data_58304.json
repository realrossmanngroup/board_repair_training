With internal display plugged in I have no image on it (but still on external display). The Apple Logo on the back cover is ON when the OS boot is over and I have <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> = 40V, which supposed to mean that the LCD is not seen. The LCD is not cracked and both connector and cable looks good. The board also looks good.\n\nSo far, I have replace the LCD cable, the LCD assembly and finally the LCD connector, still have <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> = 40V\n\nHere some measurement on J8300 :\n- <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> = 40V\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_EDP_R</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n- <SIGNAL>PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD</SIGNAL> = 5V\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_LCD</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n- <SIGNAL>I2C_TCON_SCL</SIGNAL> = 0V\n- <SIGNAL>I2C_TCON_SDA</SIGNAL> = 0V\n- <SIGNAL>DP_INT_ML_P</SIGNAL><0> = 0V as <1>, <2>, <3>\n- <SIGNAL>DP_INT_ML_N</SIGNAL><0> = 0V as <1>, <2>, <3>\n- <SIGNAL>DP_INT_ML_C_P</SIGNAL><0> = 0.46V as <1>, <2>, <3>\n- <SIGNAL>DP_INT_ML_C_N</SIGNAL><0> = 0.46V as <1>, <2>, <3>\n\nNo short on J8300, FL8300 to FL8303 seems fine, all <SIGNAL>DP_INT_ML</SIGNAL> lines have continuity. Could 40V on PPVOUT be a logic board problem or is it often because of the display/connector ?\n\nThank you for your help, I really hope the problem doesn't come from <CHIP>U0500</CHIP>."

I'll try an other assembly as soon as I find an other one.\n\nWhen you say \"check all C832x\", you mean check for a short on the pins or there is an other way to check a capacitor ? All traces between C832x and F830x are fine (bip in diode mode)."
