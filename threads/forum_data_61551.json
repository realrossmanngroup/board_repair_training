        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7710": "What is D7710? a DIODE.",
        "U7700": "What is U7700? a CHIP.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "R7731": "What is R7731? a RESISTOR."

No liquid/moisture damage.\n- After the backlight IC replacement, the backlight started working.\n- Now, most of the time the display flickers after restarts for a few minutes.\n- Tested with 2 different ICs, same issue.\n\nWhat could be wrong?"
