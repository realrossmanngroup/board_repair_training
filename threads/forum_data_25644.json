Said he had some sort of audio adapter connected to left USB port and when he pulled it out his mac shut down and would not boot again.\n\nI couldnt find a schematic for this board to start troubleshooting. Does it exist? If you have please share.\n\nMagsafe goes from green to Orange with and WITHOUT battery connected. Macbook responds to SMC button sequence reset by changing magsafe colors but still no fan or action.\n\nAny advice how to proceed?"

So gonna start trouble shooting that one and hopefully its the same problem on both board. But if you already know this problem and have a solution I would appreciate if you help me out.\n\nThanks!"

            "message": "Hi Duke,\n\nYeah that machine has a little history because it had signs of previous intrusion. When I asked the guy what has been previously done to it he said that he had keyboard replaced before due to a minor liquid spill. That was about half a year ago according to him. \nI did not see any sign of water damage on his motherboard but I can clearly see that someone has been in here before because of the screw threats having screwdriver marks and crumpled sticker on battery connector and finger prints on keyboard backlight. And a little coffee spot on back cover inside lol\nI have to do a lot of track sweeping before he can take to apple...\nHow does apple warranty work? 1 or 2 years from the date of purchase or from model introduction or discontinue date?"
