When start it has some delay and after 2-3 seconds start run very high. \n\n\nAlready changed <CHIP>U5570</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q5501</TRANSISTOR>. Same result. \n\nRun AHT and it it gives me 3 errors:\n\nFan-Right side (test1) Qiuck motor test-> Error - MOtor is spinning slower than should\n\nSame with test 2 fo right side fan\n\n\nAnd\n\nCPU Front Side Bus (1,05V) current (test) -> Sensor is reading above the high limit. +"
