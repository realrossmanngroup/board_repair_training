        "message":"Hello Everybody\n\nWorking on liquid damaged around SMC  820-3437-b. Come with no power problem . After reball SMC power come back and machine power and OS loading ok but now fan problem and slow. \n\nReballed 2 times but nothing changed. SMC log at bottom.\n\nTried also I\/O board and trackpad but nothing change where can i check next step?\n\n\n\n[I]12\/31\/15 17:15:10] SMC: 0x0 (test #1) - SMC Critical Sensor Check Test\n\n- Checks if the SMC reports any errors on critical sensors.\n\n[17:15:10] ERROR -- 1 [The SMC reports an error on one or more critical sensors.] -- TEST FAILED\n\n[12\/31\/15 17:15:10] SMC: 0x0 (test #7) -

        "message":"Thanks for answer Duke and aprendiz,\nYes you are right when checked SMBUS_SMC_1_S0_SCL line voltage is drop 0.6V ( must be 3.4 v ) Checked R5361 fine also replaced.\nWhen checked line not short a ground ( checking voltage when board is pulled out with out lcd keyboard etc. , when machine turn power on SMBUS_SMC_1_S0_SCL voltage is ok 3.4 v but mouse light is turned on , so machine started. voltage is pull down 0.6v ) Checked line witch component connected every thing is looking good.\n\nLast step cut SMBUS_SMC_1_S0_SCL line to SMC connection voltage is normal 3.4V .\n\nAlso replaced SMC same issue :(\n\nI cant understand why SMBUS_SMC_1_S0_SCL voltage is pulling down when connected SMC.\n\nnote: Sorry for bad english.... I hope described correctly."
