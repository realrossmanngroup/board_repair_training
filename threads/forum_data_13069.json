When running apps that are heavy on the GPU flickering gets worse.\n2) External monitor is fine and shows no issues\n3) Changing the LCD position has no effect (so most likely no cable issue).\n\nDevice has never been dropped and there is no water damage.\nAny ideas? Bad LCD or more likely logic-board issue?\n\nCheers,\n\nHendrik"}
