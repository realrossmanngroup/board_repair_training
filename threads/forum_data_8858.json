    "definitions": {
        "820-3462": "What is 820-3462? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",
        "R1800": "What is R1800? a RESISTOR.",
        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",
        "C1802": "What is C1802? Capacitor to ground on PCH_SRTCRST_L on machines from 2009-2012, PCH_SRTCRST_L needs to be high for PCH to not be in RTC reset mode, this capacitor can become corroded or leaky and result in this signal being pulled low. ."

Seller said it just stopped working one day. I'm sure I was the first person who took \nthis macbook apart.\n\nLot of dust in it. No liquid. It wasn't dropped for sure.\nIt doesn't power on.\n\nWell some measurements:\n\nHas green and orange light. It charged up my test battery. Went from orange to green after an hour.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.55V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 3.3V\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL> 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> 3.3V\n\nHere is the problem : <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL> 0V.\nThere is no short on <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL>. \nThis comes from SMC if I'm not mistaken. \nBad SMC?\n\nThank you."
