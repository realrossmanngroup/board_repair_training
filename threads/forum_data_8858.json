Not a single scratch not even at the bottom of the macbook.\nNo liquid damage. Seller said it just stopped working one day. I'm sure I was the first person who took \nthis macbook apart.\n\nLot of dust in it. No liquid. It wasn't dropped for sure.\nIt doesn't power on.\n\nWell some measurements:\n\nHas green and orange light. It charged up my test battery. Went from orange to green after an hour.\n\nPPBUS_G3H 12.55V\nPP3V3_S5 3.3V\n\nSMC_RESET_L 3.3V\nPM_PWRBTN_L 3.3V\nPM_RSMRST_L 3.3V\nSMC_ONOFF_L 3.3V\n\nHere is the problem : PM_SYSRST_L 0V.\nThere is no short on PM_SYSRST_L. \nThis comes from SMC if I'm not mistaken. \nBad SMC?\n\nThank you."}
