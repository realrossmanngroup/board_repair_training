Customer mentioned getting the \"the computer restarted because of a problem\" alert if they're able to log in quick enough. Once it's unresponsive the caps lock key no longer illuminates and there's no USB activity if an optical mouse is connected.\n\nAt this point if it's rebooted, it draws power, the trackpad becomes clickable but nothing further occurs (no logo\/chime, no USB activity, caps lock light or external display output).\n\nIf left powered off and connected to power for ~2\/3 hours it will then boot successfully again and the cycle repeats.\n\nBoard looks clean, no signs of liquid damage. Originally thought this was going to be another bad CPU but symptoms seem a little different from what I've seen before."}
