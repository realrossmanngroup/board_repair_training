        "message":"Hey everybody\n\nI've got an issue with 820-00138 motherboard.\n\nIt doesn't charge the new battery, had to replace as previous, was inflated.\n\nHistory : a customer brought the laptop cause wasn't powering on. When opened, the battery was inflated with a lot of dusty mess all around\n\nSo I replaced the battery and cleaned all around. After a week a so the happy customer came back saying it wasn't charging( or very slow during night when not used)\n\nSo now when plugin different (original) know working magsafe chargers it blinks green. When unplug the battery the magsafe stays steady amber.\n\nThe macbook works but unable to charge.\n\nHere some measurements i did (based on similar issue from forum) : \n\nPPBUS_G3H on F7700 - 16.21V - without battery connected\nPPBUS_G3H on F7700 -  fluctuates 10.81V to 16.1V - with battery connected\nSMC_CHGR_BMON - on R5423 - 0.66mV - without battery\nSMC_CHGR_BMON - on R5423 - jumping from 0.66mV to 253 mV - with battery\nResistance between pins 27\/28 on U7100 - 21.4 omhs\nU7001 - pin 5 - 3.42V\nU7001 - pin 1,2 - fluctuates from 0 up to 4V when battery and charger connected\nU7100 - pin 14  - fluctuates from 0 up to 4V when battery and charger connected\nU5000 - R5187 - 2.8V\n\nU7100 was corroded (here some pics) replaced with donor board magsafe still blinking\n\nAll measurements were made with original U7100 cleaned and resoldered\n\nThank  you for your help\n\nRegards"
