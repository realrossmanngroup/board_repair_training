        "A1990": "What is A1990? A1990 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2018, 2019 with EMC3215, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01041, 820-01814..",
        "820-01814": "What is 820-01814? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "U3200": "What is U3200? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO": "What is PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO? PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on..",
        "PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC": "What is PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC? PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad..",
        "PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD": "What is PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD? PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing chip. When this is missing, either a capacitor on the line has shorted, PP3V3_G3H is missing, or the CD3215 is bad..",
        "PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA": "What is PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA? This is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad. Each CD3215 in the system needs to be functioning in order for any of them to speak to the charger and negotiate receiving 20v from the charger rather than the default 5v that a USB-C charger puts out before communicating with the system. .",
        "PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS": "What is PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS? PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS is 20v in from the USB-C charger on USB-C powered Macbook Pros..",
        "C9080": "What is C9080? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "C7050": "What is C7050? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for battery current sensing, you should measure around 2.202 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
