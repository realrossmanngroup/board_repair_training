Looked totally clean, no signs of liquid damage.\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> fluctuates from 16.3v to about 16.7v every few seconds, and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> fluctuates similarly except just above 2v. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> just runs itself down from 8v, doesn't fluctuate.\n\nUsually when I've seen this on other boards I find a missing/bad resistor somewhere along the <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> line, but from the ones I tested beforehand everything looked good. It's been a while though, so I'll just recheck what you guys think should be checked first."

No dents or anything on the case though, so I'm not sure about drops.\n\nI also did some more digging and found some slight corrosion around <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>--not a ton, but enough to where it looked pretty shoddy. I took em off, tinned pads and put on a <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> from a 3437. Unsure if those are compatible? But they seemed to have the same circuitry/ID on the chipface, so I put it on to test. Nothing changed much, although I do get a light on the charger much more consistently now.\n\nI still have the issue where the computer will spin the fan but won't chime, or chime very infrequently. The inconsistency of the symptoms makes me think it's something to do with a bad trace, but honestly I dunno. I also don't know how <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> would've been potentially shorting 3v42 occasionally, but I'm lost anyway lol.\n\nAny ideas?"
