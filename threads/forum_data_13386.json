            "message": "I am going to oversimplify. 99% of the time, this will be one of four things.\n\n1) <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is shorted to ground.\n2) The IC responsible for creating <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is not receiving power on its VIN/VCC/VDD/voltage input pin.\n3) The IC responsible for creating <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is bad.\n4) The IC responsible for creating <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is not being told to create <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>.\n\nLooking at the page, on the side where <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is created, we have a pin called \"EN\"... let's guess. <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> is the name of the signal present at the ENable pin. Let's guess what <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> stands for. <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL>.. as in, ENable <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. According to your measurements, we have 3.4v there - so the IC responsible for creating <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is being told to turn on. This crosses out #4 as a possible problem.\n\n<CHIP>TPS51980</CHIP> is an electronic chip, and like all electronic chips, to do something it wants power. What feeds it power? Datasheet says it gets power to do what it does on the VIN pin. VIN, as in, voltage in, as in, power going into it so it can turn on is provided on pin 23. Pin 23 is getting 12.56v, which is a healthy <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> power rail. So, the chip responsible for creating <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is receiving the power it needs to turn on. This crosses out #2.\n\nSo this leaves either #1, or #3. I would measure the resistance to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. If the resistance is very low in contrast to what you get on a donor board; something is shorted to ground. However, if the resistance to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is high, then, this would leave #3 as the winning possibility; <CHIP>TPS51980</CHIP> is bad.\n\nPage 60, 61, then 69-75 in the homework document I gave you will cover this. Tell me you didn't delete it!"
