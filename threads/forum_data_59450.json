When I plug it into my USB-C meter it is pulling 700mA @ 19.7V which seems to me like it is charging but the percentage stays at zero."

So I'm submitting to the theory that since I am getting proper charging current, the board is trying to talk to the battery but since the SDA pin in the cable is broken somewhere they cannot communicate. There is not one speck of liquid or anything, no corrosion so I think that backs my theory up. I have a fully stocked shop except for that darned cable..."
