Also the battery is bloated so i have not connected it. And finally with external hdd its working fine. On the internal software its lagging extremely, this may be a software issue i have not formated it yet. Any ideas? Without the battery and without the button it turns off by itself, if i connect the button, still without the battery it doesn't turn on at all. The button itself is not sorted. Could it be an issue with the motherboard or is it a dead button?"}
