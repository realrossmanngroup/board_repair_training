This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",
