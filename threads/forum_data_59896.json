However, there are 2 Lid signals . SMC_LID_LEFT and SMC_LID_RIGHT both are connected to U4850.\nBoth get 1.5v and firt i thought its wrong. I checked with working board and its same voltage. Anyhow LID_RIGHT cmmunicating with J6100. this could be that singal coming from IO board. is this correct?"}
