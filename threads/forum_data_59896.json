If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_RIGHT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

However, there are 2 Lid signals . <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_LEFT</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_RIGHT</SIGNAL> both are connected to <CHIP>U4850</CHIP>.\nBoth get 1.5v and firt i thought its wrong. I checked with working board and its same voltage. Anyhow <SIGNAL>LID_RIGHT</SIGNAL> cmmunicating with J6100. this could be that singal coming from IO board. is this correct?"
