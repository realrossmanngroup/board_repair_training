We have PM_SLP_S5_L\nWe have PM_RSMRST and all other chipset support stuff like SUS voltages.\nI have tried a new Bios Chip. The board looks very clean and maybe not liquid damaged. \n\nPM_SLP_S4_L has 36k to ground so it doesn't seem like theres a short on the line.\n\nIve checked all inductors to ground, only one looking low is l7630 being 1.6Ohm \nThe board pulls 0.56A from the supply, the usual S5 state is around 0.32A, but this minute difference doesn't give much away. \n\nAny ideas would be appreciated.\nThanks"}

Just to add there is no fan spin, nothing changes in SMC bypass. Im starting to think i may have a PCH replacement to do."}
