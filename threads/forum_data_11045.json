        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PM_RSMRST": "What is PM_RSMRST? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_BATLOW": "What is PM_BATLOW? PM_BATLOW is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on.",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",

        "PCH_INTVRMEN_L": "What is PCH_INTVRMEN_L? PCH_INTVRMEN_L is a signal that stands for Internal Voltage Regulator Enable. When pulled high, this signal enables the internal 1.05 V regulators for the Suspend well in the PCH. This signal must be pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H..",

We have <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>\nWe have <SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST</SIGNAL> and all other chipset support stuff like SUS voltages.\nI have tried a new Bios Chip. The board looks very clean and maybe not liquid damaged. \n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> has 36k to ground so it doesn't seem like theres a short on the line.\n\nIve checked all inductors to ground, only one looking low is l7630 being 1.6Ohm \nThe board pulls 0.56A from the supply, the usual S5 state is around 0.32A, but this minute difference doesn't give much away. \n\nAny ideas would be appreciated.\nThanks"
