USC'd it and dried and day later it booted and ran video/heavy cpu activity on the bench for couple of hours. My tech reinstalled it and now it just chimes once and then no USB activity at all. Pulled it and on bench again and same result as in the chassis. \n\nUSB shows continuous power just no activity.\nUsed Medusa for CleanME.\n<SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> remains present. \n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is 1.8V. \n\nI was going to USC one more time as a hail mary unless you had suggestions."
