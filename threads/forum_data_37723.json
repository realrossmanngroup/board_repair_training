Or do I have a pulled pad.\n\nThank you"}

Everything seems to have correct voltage until L9701. I'm not getting 50 Volts from there.\n\nReplace L9701?"}

It won't turn on with a screen plugged in. I saw and heard electricity at the lcd connector\n\nThere was an image, no backlight. Not sure now. At L9701 it was 12.5V or whatever was correct before the coil."}
