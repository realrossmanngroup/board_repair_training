I have the following voltages:\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"410px\" alt=\"1606820230844.png\"]59576[\/ATTACH]\nIt gets to S0 state with a consumption around .360A and then goes goes to .033A. Where should I start looking ?\nJust checked and I got a pulse for a second on PM_SLP_S4_L \/ PM_SLP_S3_L and PM_SLP_S0_L\nPPVCC_S0_CPU pulses at 1.7v too...\nAlso have a pulsing ALL_SYS_PWRGD and PLT_RESET_L\nI am completely lost, how can I find the problem on this board?\nAll the pulses are when I power on the board with my PSU. If I leave it on PP3v3_s3 = .416v and pp3v3_s0 = 1.9v which makes no sense!  Please Help!\nThanks"}
