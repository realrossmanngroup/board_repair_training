        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "PP3V3_S3": "What is PP3V3_S3? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_SLP_S0_L": "What is PM_SLP_S0_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. ."

I have the following voltages:\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"410px\" alt=\"1606820230844.png\"]59576[/ATTACH]\nIt gets to S0 state with a consumption around .360A and then goes goes to .033A. Where should I start looking ?\nJust checked and I got a pulse for a second on <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> / <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S0_L</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> pulses at 1.7v too...\nAlso have a pulsing <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL>\nI am completely lost, how can I find the problem on this board?\nAll the pulses are when I power on the board with my PSU. If I leave it on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> = .416v and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> = 1.9v which makes no sense!  Please Help!\nThanks"
