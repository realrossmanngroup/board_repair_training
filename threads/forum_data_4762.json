(1 beep ram).\nI solved the no ram detection, it was the DATA smbus line talking to the pch being pulled down by a low short coming from bad looking <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> area (sharing same data lines with PCH). Just isolated the communication with <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> by removing <RESISTOR>R9757</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R9753</RESISTOR>.\n\nNow Ram A & B are working properly, I have all rails.\n<SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> 0,77v\n<SIGNAL>AXG_VCORE</SIGNAL> 0,45v not sure if it's too low I know it's dynamic.\n<SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWRGD</SIGNAL> ok\n<CHIP>U7400</CHIP> area clean, Checked <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_TON</SIGNAL> continuity and resistor and all is ok.\n\nNow I am lost, what could prevent the board from chiming  when <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>AXG_VCORE</SIGNAL> are present?\nBios? Should I remove <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> right now or not relevant at this stage. Also <SIGNAL>WS_LEFT_SHIFT_KBD</SIGNAL> pin is broken but don't think important for now."
