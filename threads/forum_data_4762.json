(1 beep ram).\nI solved the no ram detection, it was the DATA smbus line talking to the pch being pulled down by a low short coming from bad looking LP8550 area (sharing same data lines with PCH). Just isolated the communication with LP8550 by removing R9757 and R9753.\n\nNow Ram A & B are working properly, I have all rails.\nCpu_vcore 0,77v\nAXG_Vcore 0,45v not sure if it's too low I know it's dynamic.\nPM_PCH_PWRGD ok\nU7400 area clean, Checked CPUIMVP_TON continuity and resistor and all is ok.\n\nNow I am lost, what could prevent the board from chiming  when cpu_vcore and axg_vcore are present?\nBios? Should I remove LP8550 right now or not relevant at this stage. Also WS_LEFT_SHIFT_KBD pin is broken but don't think important for now."}

Also you can connect a USB mouse and if the light comes on the board is working."}

You were right, \nUsb connected gave a red light. Plugged an external keyboard and PRAM\u00b4ed the board.\n\nConclusion: water dammaged LP8550 witch pulled down a shared pch bus data line that prevent detection of SODIMM A and B + logic board needed a pram."}
