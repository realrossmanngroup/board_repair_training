            "message": "Hi Guys.\n\nI have this <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1989</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> that decided to stop powering on. The client said that the OS crashed during the backup of data and then it went into safe mode. They went to another shop and from that moment it stopped powering on. The laptop had some coffee(probably) spill near the trackpad area but they seem not to be aware of that. I measured all power lines I have <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, 3&5V from <CHIP>U7650</CHIP>, and all else besides CPU power. There's no short on the board measured with diode mode all looks fine. I have a suspicion that the T2 got corrupted but wanna advise first here before I try to recover it. Would appreciate any feedback, maybe I missed something :)\n\nThanks"
