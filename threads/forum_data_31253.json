Issue is that I can't work out how to track it down; not sure where to inject power.\n\nBoard had many issues, I replaced <CHIP>U6900</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q5310</TRANSISTOR>, <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and finally got a green light and fan spin back.\n\nIssue now is that it trips the power adapter if the battery is connected."
