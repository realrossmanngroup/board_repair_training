XW7720 is within the board, you won't visibly see it.\n\nDiode measurement on BL output pins on LCD connector; I'd bet you have a few things wrong. Start with the fuse, the BL feedback trace and your LED driver. Going to guess all those need attention. Your BL output pins on your LVDS\/LCD connector also look ugly, so you can't rule out bad connector (also) just yet...make sure your connector\/cable isn't damaged, too."
