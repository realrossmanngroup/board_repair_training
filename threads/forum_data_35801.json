I noticed that in this model they are not using the usual LCD cable with individual cables, but a flex cable. Opening up the laptop and pushing on the flex fixes the picture, so that is broken for sure, laptop is only 1.5 years, customer did not but apple care so out of warranty.\n\nIs it possible to replace that flex only, or its the whole top? (screen only and top part is almost the same price)"}

Have fun dealing with all the garbage LCDs coming from China at the moment, many of them look like shit."}
