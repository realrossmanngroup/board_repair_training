PPBUS_G3H is 12.23V, which means SMC is not talking to ISL. Replaced ISL and SMC but still same results. SMC_PM_G2_EN is not present. SMC_RESET_L is steady 3.3V. PP3V42_G3H is steady 3.42V. I get no green light on charger eve though ADAPTER_SENSE is steady 3.42V. Tried replacing magsafe board with known good one, still same. I'm stuck now. I'm sure this SMC chip I soldered is good because it was negotiating 12.56V on the donor board I took it from(donor board got bad PCH). What else can I check?"}
