I have a board that has All of the G3H rails as well as PM_DSW_PWRGD but not turning on. I remember having another board with a similar issue but cannot find the thread. If I remember correctly, the SMC sends PM_DSW_PWRGD to the PCH correct? I don't see any corrosion or liquid damage on any part of the board. There was a missing bypass cap by the RAM but I put it back on. Does this still indicate my SMC is not working? It is drawing .02 amps so I am missing PM_SLP_S4_L as well."}
