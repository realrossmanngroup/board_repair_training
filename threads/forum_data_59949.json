S0 voltages are cycling extremely quickly, about twice a second. Not seeing anything on CPU voltage though. I can't find any shorts or anything heating up. Sometimes the Magsafe light won't come on when plugging it in. In those cases, 3V42 and SMC_RESET_L are both still present. Not sure where to look next."}
