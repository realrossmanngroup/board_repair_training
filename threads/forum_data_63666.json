        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "CHGR_BMON": "What is CHGR_BMON? CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",
        "SMC_BMON_ISENSE": "What is SMC_BMON_ISENSE? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7151": "What is R7151? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging.."
