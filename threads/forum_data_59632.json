        "820-3536": "What is 820-3536? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",

No obvious signs of liquid damage. <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.42v but PPBUS is 12.26v. Checked pins 10 and 11 on <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and got .521 and .524 diode mode and 3.42V present on both pins. Looked around <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> but didn't see anything crazy. I reballed the SMC becuse I thought it may have had corrosion. the board itself is drawing 13mA."
