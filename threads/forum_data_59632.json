        "message":"Got an 820-3536 with no power, no MS2 light. No obvious signs of liquid damage. PP3V42_G3H is 3.42v but PPBUS is 12.26v. Checked pins 10 and 11 on U7100 and got .521 and .524 diode mode and 3.42V present on both pins. Looked around U1950 but didn't see anything crazy. I reballed the SMC becuse I thought it may have had corrosion. the board itself is drawing 13mA."
