        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "U1800": "What is U1800? a CHIP.",
        "BKLT_PLT_RST_L": "What is BKLT_PLT_RST_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "LVDS_IG_BKL_ON": "What is LVDS_IG_BKL_ON? LVDS_IG_BKL_ON is equivalent to LCD_BKLT_EN. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "R1981": "What is R1981? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q9707": "What is Q9707? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "LCD_BKLT": "What is LCD_BKLT? a SIGNAL.",
        "C9797": "What is C9797? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C9799": "What is C9799? a CAPACITOR.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

        "R9788": "What is R9788? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

        "LVDS_DDC_CLK": "What is LVDS_DDC_CLK? LVDS_DDC_CLK Is the DDC clock line between the graphics processor and the screen. DDC is a protocol for identifying a screen so that you know what resolution/refresh rate it wants. This is necessary for screen detection, inductor on this data line must be good and DDC voltage must be going to the LCD screen for it to work. .",
        "LVDS_DDC_DATA": "What is LVDS_DDC_DATA? LVDS_DDC_DATA Is the DDC data line between the graphics processor and the screen.

Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

So before checking for continuity I decided to flip the cable connecting to the lcd upside down and now I am getting 3.31v on Pins 2 & 3 and the lcd is working but there is no backlight(saw questionmark folder with flashlight) so I will troubleshoot this issue.

I reflowed it to see if it would work before having to replace it and after reflowing I was getting 12v on pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> which is too high and no voltage on the output pins of <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR>. \n\nI replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> but that made no difference.\n\nI replaced <RESISTOR>R9788</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR> even though they measured correct resistance because I thought that was causing pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> to be so high. I didnt have a donor board for this model so I took the resistors from a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3209</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that had the same resistance but 1/20w instead of 1/16w(don't know if that is a big issue.)\n\nNow after replacing those resistors I no longer have <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> and once again the board isn't seeing the lcd as there is no voltage on Pins 2/3 of the lcd connector and Pin 1(<SIGNAL>LCD_IG_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>) of <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>.\n\nThe lcd cable and connector look fine so I don't know what could have happened."
