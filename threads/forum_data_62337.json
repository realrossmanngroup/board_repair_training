After cleaning up and replacing bad caps and resistors board is back to 20v and partially booting but no there is no image on internal or external.\n\nWhen external plugged in with internal lcd disconnected the caps lock light comes on. Heatsink is not getting warm.\n\nLPD_INT_HPD is present 1.8V\n\nWhat should be checked next???"}
