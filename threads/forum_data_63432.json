Nobody touched it before, that's good but found more than 1 problem. I was not getting 20v on the USB amp meter and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was jumping up and down, couldn't get a reading.\n\nFound that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> was shorted by <CAPACITOR>C9501</CAPACITOR>. Removed that cap and got a nice ppbus and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>. \n\nThen noticed <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD1</SIGNAL> is 2,5ohm to ground. Hoped for a bad <CHIP>U9080</CHIP> but even after removing that still short. After injecting 2v into rail found heat was coming from <CHIP>U8600</CHIP> which is only nand chip on this left top and bottom side (there are in total of 5 nand chips). \n\nI was wondering, I have another donor board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> witch exact same volume of nand chips. Can I suffice by only switching <CHIP>U8600</CHIP>. I read a few times that you always have to change them with sets, but these look exactly the same... \n\nPlease advice. Thxs"
