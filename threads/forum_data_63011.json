I have no idea where it is, i have Paul Daniels Flexboardview and still am unable to locate it, does anyone know where it is please?\n\n2) If i go down the path or reading the chip and removing the password segment, this will be the first time i have done this so will require some help with this please. I have a TL866 programmer will this work?\n\nhoping someone can please help, i have repaired many MacBooks in the past but never tampered with programming of chips before. This would be amazing to add to my skill set..\n\nAny help would be greatly received.\n\nThank you\n\nBunty"
