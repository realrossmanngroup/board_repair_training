            "message": "Board had liquid damage to area between LVDS and <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>, then down about 2 inches, stopping right above <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR>. Board has green light, but no fan. Rails seem present, but ppbus is bouncing from ~8.4v to 8.6v pretty rapidly. Same increments over and over (i.e., reads at 8.56, then down to 8.42, to 8.50, to 8.59v, back down to 8.42v, etc). I can't recall what usually causes this type of cycling, but feel like it may be related to a mosfet not functioning properly.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated--thanks!"

I still have a ton of work to do near the LVDS, and may post back (please don't close just yet); I'll post an update once board is fully operational. Thanks!"
