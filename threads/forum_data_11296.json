        "R7052": "What is R7052? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

I cleaned the glue and I checked again and now it is ok - 0 ohm\nPPBUS now is 12.57V. Now laptop works.\n\nOnly thing I did is clean the glue. But I dont think this is the problem. Could be bad ISL or glue could cause any problem?"
