I cleaned it and put it back on.\nI have 2 computers on that model now, so that's why I was able to try a different track pad and monitor, I changed the MB to the other computer?s case and had the same problem, I will do the PRAM reset and run the diagnostics again, I?ll send the picture of the results... Thanks\n\nUpdate: in fact, I remembered just now that I took off the display port chip (U9750) because it was getting hot, but I don't know how to resolder it again because it seems like a IC and I don't have a stencil for it... Can that be a problem?"}
