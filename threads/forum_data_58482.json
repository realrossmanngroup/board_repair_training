This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",

What is the exact history of this board as I suspect this was messed with and not just that backlight problem that was fixed.\n\nCan you do a PRAM reset and run diagnostics again? Do you have another LCD assembly to try with?"

            "message": "Hi Duke, the customer said that it just didn't turn on one day... and the motherboard looked completely clean, some dust on it like usual, but no liquid damage. I tool off the TB chip because I saw the solder a little dirty, as the climate here is very humid, that happens a lot. I cleaned it and put it back on.\nI have 2 computers on that model now, so that's why I was able to try a different track pad and monitor, I changed the MB to the other computer?s case and had the same problem, I will do the PRAM reset and run the diagnostics again, I?ll send the picture of the results... Thanks\n\nUpdate: in fact, I remembered just now that I took off the display port chip (<CHIP>U9750</CHIP>) because it was getting hot, but I don't know how to resolder it again because it seems like a IC and I don't have a stencil for it... Can that be a problem?"
