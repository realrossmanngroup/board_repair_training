        "message":"Hello everyone,\n\nI have a 820-00923-A board that used to boot without any issues before I flashed the BIOS. After programming the BIOS chip with the CH341A programmer, the board did not power up anymore.\n\nSo, I took the schematics of the board and started checking the power aliases. I verified all the voltages, and they are all correct. The only skewed voltage is on PPVCC_S0_CPU, where the measured value is 0.785V instead of 1.5V. I thought the CPU might be dead, but I'm not certain.\n\nWhen I try to power on the board, I notice that it correctly receives 20V input, but only draws 0.461A. Using the thermal camera, I observe that the CPU heats up, and just above the CPU, there are the U7210, U7220, U7410, U7420, U7430 chips, all heating up beyond 45 degrees.\n\nI have tested L7210 and L7220, and on both, I read a voltage of 0.785V."

So, the system never started.\n\nI ask for your forgiveness, but I'm still a beginner, trying to do my best.\nI monitored the voltage on PPVCC_S0_CPU, and it starts rising from 0 to 0.785V instantly as soon as the board reaches a current draw of 0.488A. After about ten seconds, the board stops drawing amperes, then starts rising again to 0.488A, and the voltage on PPVCC_S0_CPU remains fixed at 0.785V for the time that I monitored it for about ten minutes, then I powered off the board. \n\nDo you think that if I replace U7210 and U7220 could I solve the problem? I thought at this because the input Voltage on the chips is right, but when I test the voltage on the inductors L7210 and L7220 it is not 1.5V but 0.785V.\n\nI want to clarify that I am conducting the test only on the board, without connecting fans or a keyboard."

I then resoldered the original BIOS chip, but the computer didn't boot with that chip either.

My curiosity about this issue has grown to the point where I'm eager to understand why the board isn't booting. I am genuinely willing to invest money in resolving this problem, all in the pursuit of learning and gaining insight into the issue."
