I watched Louis' video and he said to heat it slightly then try to pull it off but that hasn't worked for me. Maybe this just takes a few more attempts to get used to this.\n\nAlso, my stencil says 980YFC 0.3mm. Is 0.3mm the correct size because I thought I read somewhere that the size of the balls are 0.25mm."

Is it okay if I stick with them being a little smaller or will there be issues when soldering to the board?\n\nI ordered some 0.3mm but they wont arrive for a few more days."
