I have this board in that has an orange light but does not turn on, no fan spin. PPBUS_G3H is showing 8.56v on both sides of f7140. I found a cap that was askew [c7094] and replaced it. Before doing so, PP3V42_G3H was showing around 1.8V on pin 2 of L7095, now PP3V42_G3H is showing 3.335v on the same pin. \n\nNot sure where to go from here, i could really use some help. Thank you!\n\nAs a side note, are there any resources someone can point me to to break down the sleep states for macbooks? Just trying to wrap my head around the logical progression from initial power to boot."}
