            "message": "Hi. First of all sorry for my non-perfect english.\nI have a problem with <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1990</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> mac. It came with a corrosion on <CAPACITOR>C9081</CAPACITOR> and line <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H_SSD1_SNS</SIGNAL> was shorted which is a very common issue on that model. After removing shorted cap mac booted and worked stable for 2 weeks, but now it returned back. Not turning on.\n   All 4 <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> works good, all LDOs is present, charger switching to 20 volts, but taking just 0.04-0.06 amps\nMac can be detected in DFU mode by apple configurator, but reviving and restoring ends up with an error\n\nBut most weird thing is that after i plug in the charger and than plug it off - <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is shorted for 2-3 seconds, and then goes back to normal value 0.44 in diod mode. If i plug in charger again - voltage for ppbus is 12.6, whitch is seems to be a bit low. After unplugging the charger ppbus is shorted for 2-3 seconds, and goes back to normal again. I feel very confused and can not understand how is it possible that short circuit can be present and than gone by itself in couple seconds\n\nAny ideas folks?"

SSD power lines is not shorted. And <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> is missing, S5 is present and stable. Also i found out that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_TBT_X_SX</SIGNAL> is missing as well, and it comes out from <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>. Is it possible that <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> is damaged because there was a short on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4_X_USBC</SIGNAL> which goes directly to <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>? All 4 LDOs (3.3, 1.8, 1.8, and 1.1) is present on all 4 <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>"
