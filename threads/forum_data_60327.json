        "message":"hello there!\nhave solved some issues on this already. mainly it was compeltely dead, no green light and no boot. \nhas had water damage but im not sure if that was the cause, i have a feeling it was to do with a fake charger to begin with. anyway, to start with i replaced ISL 6259 and also both r005 and r020 were both infinite resistance. \n\nNow it will boot with a fake charger but not with the original. the original will just pulse on and off green. \nPP3v42 is pulsing of course as well. I have also noticed that there seems to maybe be leakage to ground there. its around 70 ohms to grown on pp3v42"
