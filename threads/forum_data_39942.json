I've also seen a million cases where a BIOS prevents a chime at all; or allows a chime but no other boot progress; or a chime and partial boot; or a chime, partial boot and boot to SSD but not USB; or a chime and internet recovery, but no boot to SSD or USB; or a chime and boot but no trackpad/keyboard functionality. The symptoms are not set in stone when it comes to a corrupt/damaged/bad BIOS. There definitely is absolutely no guarantee that a board will chime if you simply swap another BIOS chip over to it; this is ESPECIALLY true for the 2015+ models...they just don't behave the same way as older models. They also don't always like a \"clean\" ME...a vast majority of the time they will only work (chime, boot) with their [U][B]original[/B][/U] ME region. Cleaning it kills boot a vast majority of the time.\n\nYou're going to drive yourself crazy until you do a proper BIOS test."
