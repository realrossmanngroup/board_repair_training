        "message":"Hello, got a1706 in with display issue:\n\nCold start with no image but backlight is on, if you leave the machine on, after some time you start to see the image: it start to appear with a lot of horizontal lines and after some time ( i presume when tcon heat up) the image is almost good (just couple, not very noticeable horizontal lines left on top)\n\nI presume the issue is with tcon, will test it with another lcd to confirm, but the question is:\n\nIs it possible to change the chip or maybe the whole tcon board from another lcd? Was not able to find any information on that one\n\nThank you!"
