Just to make sure though, is there a way to measure smc lid with the keyboard connected? trackpad flex makes it impossible to measure the logic board -- solder wires?"}

It is under a metal cover under the left shift. Kinda annoying to measure on an A1534, but should not be needed, just look for corrosion or missing sensor."}
