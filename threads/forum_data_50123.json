            "message": "820 00138 -\nComputer not switching on\nfound <TRANSISTOR>Q8020</TRANSISTOR> burnt out so replaced, trying to switch on, no fan spin, then found short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>.\nBefore replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q8020</TRANSISTOR> the board was producing no heat at all. Injecting voltage, the main thing that gets warm is <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> and the other side of the board. I don't have any freeze spray at the moment, but until I do, with <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> getting warm is it game over for the computer or could it simply be a shorted out cap somewhere. With injecting 3.3v in the line, the board is drawing a bit more than 2.6a. The area of the board pictured has <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> on the other side of it. Whilst injecting 3.3v, the bigger caps in that area of the board do get warm and dry off isopropyl quite quickly.\nTIA"
