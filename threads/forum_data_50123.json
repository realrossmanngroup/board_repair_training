Injecting voltage, the main thing that gets warm is u1100 and the other side of the board. I don't have any freeze spray at the moment, but until I do, with u1100 getting warm is it game over for the computer or could it simply be a shorted out cap somewhere. With injecting 3.3v in the line, the board is drawing a bit more than 2.6a. The area of the board pictured has u1100 on the other side of it. Whilst injecting 3.3v, the bigger caps in that area of the board do get warm and dry off isopropyl quite quickly.\nTIA"}
