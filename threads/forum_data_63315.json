I've inspected visually the whole board and no burn marks.\n\nNow I have \nPPBUS_G3H - 12.57V\nPP3V42_G3H -3.42V\nPPVRTC_G3H - 3.33V\nPP5V_S5 - Cycling 2.75V to 5V\n\nOn PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL - cycling\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL - 16.52V\nPDCINVSENS_EN_L_DIV - Cycling 8V, 12V and 16.6V\nPM_SLP_SUS_L - Cycling 0V to 3V\n\nI just have no idea where else to check."}
