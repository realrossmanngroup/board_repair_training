This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

I have already changed <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> because it had a short on <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>.\nWhen i Changed <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> i might have ripped of the <SIGNAL>TP_UPC_XA_DBG_UART_TX</SIGNAL> Pin. But i couldnt find it anywhere else on the Boardview. Is this Pin doing anything?\n\nAfter i have Changed those two chips i read the following Voltages:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVBUS_LIO</SIGNAL>:5.20V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL>:3.0V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3H</SIGNAL>:0.2V / 6.62KOhms\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>:0V /4.55KOhms\n\nWhat i Noticed is that i dont have <RESISTOR>R3061</RESISTOR>. It was missing from when i started trying to repair it.\nCan you help me out with this?\n\nGreetings from Germany"
