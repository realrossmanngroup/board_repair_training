    "definitions": {
        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "PP3V3_S3": "What is PP3V3_S3? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_BATLOW_L": "What is SMC_BATLOW_L? SMC_BATLOW_L refers to a power management signal that indicates a low battery condition. The \"_L\" suffix suggests that this is an active-low signal, meaning that it becomes low when the battery reaches a low voltage threshold..",
        "ISNS_HS_OTHER_N": "What is ISNS_HS_OTHER_N? a SIGNAL.",
        "ISNS_HS_OTHER_P": "What is ISNS_HS_OTHER_P? a SIGNAL.",
        "R5410": "What is R5410? a RESISTOR.",
        "U5410": "What is U5410? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "PP3V_S0": "What is PP3V_S0? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
        "R7403": "What is R7403? a RESISTOR."
