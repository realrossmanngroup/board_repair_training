        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",

I have replaced this chip and fixed a trace to <RESISTOR>R8156</RESISTOR> that was gone. The fan makes a tiny move but system doesnt boot. <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> and <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> have power and look clean but pin 5 is pulsing and no are other lines. After measuring all voltages I get following:\n\n<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>  =   8.6 \n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> =   3.44\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 5v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> = pulsing 0-5v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>  = 3.34\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL>  =  3.34 pulsingPPVCC_S0_CPU = pulsingALL_SYS_PWRGD = pulsing\n<SIGNAL>PM_S0_PGOOD</SIGNAL> on <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> = pulsing\n\nWhat should i be looking for?"
