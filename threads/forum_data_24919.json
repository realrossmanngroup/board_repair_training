I have replaced this chip and fixed a trace to R8156 that was gone. The fan makes a tiny move but system doesnt boot. U6100 and U1950 have power and look clean but pin 5 is pulsing and no are other lines. After measuring all voltages I get following:\n\n820-3437\n\nPPBUS_G3H  =   8.6 \nPP3V42_G3H =   3.44\nPP5V_S5 = 5v\nPP5V_S4 = pulsing 0-5v\nPP3v3_S5  = 3.34\nPP3v3_S4  =  3.34 pulsingPPVCC_S0_CPU = pulsingALL_SYS_PWRGD = pulsing\nPM_S0_PGOOD on U1950 = pulsing\n\nWhat should i be looking for?"}
