Original issue was no power, found U7701 had solder bridge from previous repair causing the short, pulled U7701 and found pins 5 was missing and the previous repair was in an attempt to bridge the connection, but they used too much solder. Replace U7701 and corrected the bridge they were attempting, see pic. I also confirmed pin 5 wasn't bridging 10, 9, 4 and was making connection to C7797.\n\n\n\nBoard booted up find after but the display wouldn't come on. After shutting it down, this is when the new issue began. \n\nI've replace bios chip, U1900 even though previous had clock signal coming out, confirm U1950 was sending PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK (3.4V). \n\nAny suggestions?"}
