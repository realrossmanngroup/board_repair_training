The airs use the same onewire circuit as the unibodies and retinas do, the chips are interchangeable, the pinouts are the same."}

That is a great Cheat! I will have to try it next time, I did get lucky and it was just corrosion on ppbus_g3hot and a bad i\/o board. Now i need to order another one to keep one for testing purposes."}
