It's very interessting what your asking because:\n\nWith any 12800S ram in any slot it's starting for almost 5-6 sec then stops in loop same in smc bypass mode.\n\nWithout ram or with 10600S in any slot , fan spin non stop to the max and i've noticed the L7510 and L7520 are burning hot and can't keep my finger on them more than 1-2 sec like if the CPU is comsuming too much power, of course without the heatsink the machine stops after the fan reaches the max speed and I guess the over temp limit.\n\nMy guess maybe dead CPU.....but i'd like to have the experts point of view and also maybe any more steps to check in the troubleshoot process."
