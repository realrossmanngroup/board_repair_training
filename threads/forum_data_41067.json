        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

            "message": "This 12\" Macbook was sent in as intermittently turning on when the charger gets plugged in. I removed the USB-C charging port and noticed one of the pins were gone so I replaced the port and it turned on fine after that. The only issue was that the keyboard and trackpad were not working so I replaced the trackpad cable and everything worked fine after that. I was able to shut down the machine and turn it on multiple times with no problems.\n\nThe last thing I did was run the apple diagnostics test and after it passed I shut it down and left the charger in for another 30 minutes before unplugging it. This morning I tried turning it on and it won't turn on with the charger plugged in and even after an SMC reset.\n\nHere are some measurements I got. The 5v and 3v3 s5 rails are present but the s4 rails and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> is not present.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 8.6v\n<SIGNAL>PPVBUS_E85</SIGNAL> - 20v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL> - 3.24v\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.29v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3H_LDO</SIGNAL> - 5v\n\nI tried measuring <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> but as far as I can tell it is at 0v. It was kind of hard to get correct spots to measure it because the probe points and resistors didn't look to be in the exact spot as the boardview says."
