        "message":"This 12\" Macbook was sent in as intermittently turning on when the charger gets plugged in. I removed the USB-C charging port and noticed one of the pins were gone so I replaced the port and it turned on fine after that. The only issue was that the keyboard and trackpad were not working so I replaced the trackpad cable and everything worked fine after that. I was able to shut down the machine and turn it on multiple times with no problems.\n\nThe last thing I did was run the apple diagnostics test and after it passed I shut it down and left the charger in for another 30 minutes before unplugging it. This morning I tried turning it on and it won't turn on with the charger plugged in and even after an SMC reset.\n\nHere are some measurements I got. The 5v and 3v3 s5 rails are present but the s4 rails and pp3v3_sus is not present.\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.6v\nPPVBUS_E85 - 20v\nPP3v3_G3H - 3.3v\nPP3V3R3V0_AON - 3.24v\nPPVRTC_G3H - 3.29v\nPP5V_G3H_LDO - 5v\n\nI tried measuring PM_SLP_S5_L but as far as I can tell it is at 0v. It was kind of hard to get correct spots to measure it because the probe points and resistors didn't look to be in the exact spot as the boardview says."

It was just an issue with the charger port but I will ultrasonic it and see if that fixes it.\n\nUpdate: I ultrasonic'd the board but still have the same issue. I know the board is getting power because the white led comes on when the charger is plugged in without the battery being connected."
