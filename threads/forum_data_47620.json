If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."

            "message": "Liquid damage wasn't too extensive, but particularly bad regarding the pads of F9700--the corrosion essentially ate it's way thru some of the board, and there's a shallow divot where the pads should be. Otherwise, some slight corrosion and a totally burnt out L9004, same issue with F9700 where it's eaten slightly thru the board. The area directly to the bottom of F9700 was somewhat liquid damaged, no heavy corrosion but the components don't look stellar.\n\nPP3v42 is fine, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is sitting slightly under 1v, at around .990v. Pretty sure the short is on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> side, as w/F7040 removed the short to ground disappears on <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CGHR_REG</SIGNAL>, but <SIGNAL>BUS_G3H</SIGNAL> remains at 0.00v in diode mode, some other lines are shorted to ground, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is also 0.00v in diode mode--haven't gone thru the whole G3H and S0 rails yet tho.\nWhen plugged into magsafe, you get a dim green light and some immense heat coming from <CHIP>U9701</CHIP>'s right side of resistors. I tried removing <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> and those resistors to see if any of the shorts on the main lines would go away, but they didn't, and that's the only place on the board I'm getting heat.\n\nGuessing you guys will tell me to check the rest of the main rails to see what else is missing, so I'll do that while I wait for a response, but what do you think it could be? I did reflow the SMC as there was some slight corrosion on the top end of the board but like I said, very light stuff and it changed nothing."
