At first I thought was related to TPS chip being PPBUS is sometimes 12.65V and drops but if the DCIN is rolling from 16V and dropping, different issue I'm guessing?\n\nNo shorts on any of the coils and made sure to check L7220\/60.\n\nSHould I be focusing on U7200 for the issues or would that not also cause PPDCIN to rise and fall also?"}
