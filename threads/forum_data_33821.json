It's rated at 1MOhm.\n\nThe pads look clean and unused.  and electrically the resistor doesn't look like it would do much other than provide a bias for start-up.  \n\nIs this intentionally\/acceptably missing from the board or perhaps another thing that got lost in the original short circuit?  I can't tell from the crystal whether it has a bias resistor internally.  \n\nthanks in advance,\nJustin"}

I had seen that but, not being an entirely native English speaker, I had not put the proverbial 2 and 2 together and realised that meant what you said.  Now that you write it, it's rather obvious!"}
