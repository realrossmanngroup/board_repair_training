            "message": "In hunting around a board I find that there is a resistor on the schematic and boardview (<RESISTOR>R1906</RESISTOR>) that seems to connect the 25MHz crystal pins (<SIGNAL>SYSCLK_CLK25M_X2_R</SIGNAL> and _L) serving <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>.  It's rated at 1MOhm.\n\nThe pads look clean and unused.  and electrically the resistor doesn't look like it would do much other than provide a bias for start-up.  \n\nIs this intentionally/acceptably missing from the board or perhaps another thing that got lost in the original short circuit?  I can't tell from the crystal whether it has a bias resistor internally.  \n\nthanks in advance,\nJustin"
