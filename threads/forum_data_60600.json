It will do the initial boot with countdown, then does a quick fan spin up and shuts down. It's as if I've done an SMC reset - very similar sound with the quick fan spinup. It did boot all the way once and I deleted the SSD. It has been removed from the previous iCloud account. It did have a weird message though that said it is not activation locked and I can proceed with recovery. Normally is just says your Mac has been activated. Has anyone else experienced this?"}
