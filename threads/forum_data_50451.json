        "820-3662": "What is 820-3662? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",

This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

Also checked the logic board and found a small amount of liquid damage near DC in board (<CAPACITOR>C8324</CAPACITOR> & surrounding), and a bit more under the tape at <CAPACITOR>C7372</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7378</CAPACITOR>, and the CPU screw mount next to <CAPACITOR>C1099</CAPACITOR> had popped off the board. Cleaned up corrosion and epoxied CPU screw mount. Popped replacement battery in and.... fuck, it powers on and fans spin for about 5 seconds, spin down, then spin back up and it stays on but does not post, no chime. Plugging in USB mouse shows only brief flash of light when USB is first plugged in. SMC reset done using internal kb does result in charging light change blink as per normal but otherwise has no effect. CAPS lock light does not respond. CPU gets warm after 5-10 min, but not particularly hot.  Attempting to power on in SMC bypass results in hurricane mode fans but no post.  Genuine MagSafe 2 charger.\n\nSome readings:\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.68\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.36\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 5.09\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> = 5.09\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> = 5.09\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> = 5.09\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> = 3.36\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL> = 1.52\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> = 3.24\n<SIGNAL>PLT_RST_BUF_L</SIGNAL> = 3.35\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> = 1.71\n<SIGNAL>PP1V35_S3RS0_CPUDDR</SIGNAL> (pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C1099</CAPACITOR>) = 1.37\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> = .85\n\nCPU toast or is there hope?"
