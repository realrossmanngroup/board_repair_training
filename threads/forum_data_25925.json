ASD EFI hangs at \"loading video controller devices\" yet ASD OS loads without issue. I'm using an external keyboard and mouse so palm rest sensor trips, all other sensors are happy. I'm getting an error,-60 \"video controller test failed\" for h.264 decoding performance test.\" All other video tests are are passing.\n\nmem module swap produced no change in asd efi & osx hanging nor the failure of said ASD OS video controller test.\n\nTo be honest I don't know how to proceed at this point or whether I even should.\n\nThank you."
