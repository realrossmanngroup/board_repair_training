            "message": "previous issue, changed out <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> because of an intermittent display problem. It worked before, but since I changed it out it no longer displays or backlights. I was careful with heat, and used a poly tant 330uf same size package from fast fox board. Saw display wasn't working after this, and tried another one. Obviously chances are slim that they were both bad. I did notice that the new ones said case-b2-sm1 whereas the old one didn't say sm1. It just had case-b2-sm (no \"1\"). Ideas? Could it be the cap I chose?"
