    "definitions": {
        "820-00164": "What is 820-00164? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",

        "SMC_CLK32K": "What is SMC_CLK32K? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_TCK": "What is SMC_TCK? SMC_TCK is a signal that must be pulled up to 3.42v in order for the SMC to be in the proper mode to function. Often this is not pulled up because of corrosion or corroded resistors by the SMC. .",
        "SMC_TDI": "What is SMC_TDI? SMC_TDI is a signal that must be pulled up to 3.42v in order for the SMC to be in the proper mode to function. Often this is not pulled up because of corrosion or corroded resistors by the SMC. .",
        "SMC_TMS": "What is SMC_TMS? SMC_TMS is a signal that must be pulled up to 3.42v in order for the SMC to be in the proper mode to function. Often this is not pulled up because of corrosion or corroded resistors by the SMC. .",
        "SMC_EXTAL": "What is SMC_EXTAL? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_XTAL": "What is SMC_XTAL? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_WAKE_L": "What is SMC_WAKE_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_TDO": "What is SMC_TDO? SMC_TDO is a signal that must be pulled up to 3.42v in order for the SMC to be in the proper mode to function. Often this is not pulled up because of corrosion or corroded resistors by the SMC. .",
