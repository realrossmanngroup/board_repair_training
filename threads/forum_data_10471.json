        "LVDS_DDC_CLK": "What is LVDS_DDC_CLK? LVDS_DDC_CLK Is the DDC clock line between the graphics processor and the screen. DDC is a protocol for identifying a screen so that you know what resolution/refresh rate it wants. This is necessary for screen detection, inductor on this data line must be good and DDC voltage must be going to the LCD screen for it to work. .",

        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

Pin 3 has low resistance to ground 0.565k, 0.122 diod mode. I still get 3v3 volts there, while screen pluged in.\n\nI dont have other <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> motheboard but I compare to other two 15\" boards and readings are complitly different, normal ~0.500 in diod mode. THis readings are with or without <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>, so it comes from power rail, any suggestions if thats the clue or it is normal?\nIs possible that 3v3 is present but current is low so it doesn't power the chip?\nI have replaced <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> just in case."
