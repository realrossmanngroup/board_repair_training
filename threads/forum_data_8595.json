        "message":"History:  Dog piss on logic board (yes, customer admitted to dog piss). \n\nWas turning on but no backlight, had major damage to the backlight and intMD\/lvds area.  Stripped the intMD\/lvds connector and replaced all the components (fuse, 1012 caps, coil etc) until i got 0.542 diode mode reading on backlight output.  Checked for shorts to ground on all replaced components. Lp8550 feedback was fucked so ran a wire, that was all good.  \n\nPlugged in AC (known good Apple original 85w) got fan spin for 2 seconds then powered off. Now when AC power applied machine does not spin fans or go on from S4 > S4 state.\n\nChecked backlight fuse (still good), re-checked backlight area for shorts, still good.\nRemoved the backlight fuse to see if anything further up was causing it, but no change.\n\nThen back to testing power rails (results below) i've tried to follow this back through the schematic as far as i can but i'm getting a bit lost. Here are the readings i have taken so far.\n\n\nS5 rails\n\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS  present\nPPBUS_G3H present\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS present\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL 16.6v present\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.3v present\nPP3V3_S5 3.3v present\n\nPP5V_S4RS3 missing\nPP3V3_S4 missing\n\nU8080 0v at pin 2\/3 (enable pin)\n5v present at pin 29 of U7501\nQ7520 pin 1\/3 8.5v all other pins 0\nU7501 pin 4 P5VS4RS3_EN_R is 0v)\nU7501 pin 21 P3V3S5_EN_R is 3.4v\n\nso i believe the problem is on U7501 not turning P5VS4 on\nR7551 is showing as 0.5ohm\nC8175 appears to be missing from the board - is this so ?\nR8177 is missing also....\nR8179 is present on the board (PM_SLP_S4_L) and is 0v\nR1461 (PM_SLP_S4_L nearest SMC) 0v\n\nSMC_ONOFF_L is 3.4v at C4834 and at R5170. \n\nI realise these PM_SL_S4_L issues are tricky but am hoping the Rossman \/ Duke gods can suggest anything that can help before i move on."
