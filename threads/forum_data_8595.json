Stripped the intMD/lvds connector and replaced all the components (fuse, 1012 caps, coil etc) until i got 0.542 diode mode reading on backlight output.  Checked for shorts to ground on all replaced components. <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> feedback was fucked so ran a wire, that was all good.  \n\nPlugged in AC (known good Apple original 85w) got fan spin for 2 seconds then powered off.
