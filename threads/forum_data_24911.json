A known good solid state drive is not being recognized in the slot. The logic board otherwise works and has no signs of damage and no errors.\nI have checked and 3.3v seems to exist everywhere it should. Any thoughts?\n\nThanks,\n\nStefan"}

No issues with the 2013 issue sandisk drive.\nA school was swapping drives between students and happened to swap a 2013 and 2015 11\" air ssd.\nIt works fine in OS however. Not a problem that needs solved then, I will put in the correct part."}
