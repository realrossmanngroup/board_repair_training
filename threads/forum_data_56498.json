Battery is detected and charging symbol shows.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 13.1v\n\nQ7065 pins 1,2,3 (PPVBAT_G3H_CHR_R) = 13.1v\npin 4 (BGATE) = 13.1v\npins 5,6,7,8 = 11.6v\n\nWhen MacBook lid is closed, amps being pulled from charger is only 0.01. I tried existing battery as well as new battery. Same behaviour except the existing one is stuck at 1% and the 0% for the new battery."}

Without the charger connected, old battery shows 2v (most likely because it's dead and hasn't been charging) and new battery shows 11.5v.\n\nPP3V3_G3H is present with battery only only if new battery is put in. Old battery is probably just dead.\n\nHow do AMON\/BMON signals work?"}

Didn't see any signs of corrosion here, but it did the job.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have too many reliable suppliers for batteries... mostly Amazon. :\/"}
