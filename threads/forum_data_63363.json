        "message":"Hi,\n\nI have a 820-02020 with liquid damage around backlight area. Was working fine only thing was no camera. So tought lets ultrasonic to clean. And now I have a very dim image (apple logo) and then after 5 sec no image. Also after 30 sec, lcd comes on for 2 sec with backlight and image (login screen) but goes away. Thought maybe backlight issue orso but this is steady 43V until image dissapears. Figured out that everything goes black after LCD_PWR_EN goes to 0v. \n\nWhy does LCD_PWR_EN go to 0v??\n\nPlease advise."

When I press power button, the screen comes up with backlight etc... but after  5 sec goes away. And comes back again when I press power. Also when I firs connect power you hear chime, if I press power I have an Apple logo with backlight. Goes away after 5 sec! \n\nPs. This only works when power is connected not on batt?!? \n\nCould it have something to do with open lid sensor? Maybe the MacBook thinks the lid is closed.\n\n[B]Haha, after writing this down, I thought let me have look wat voltage open lid was giving. JR200 AMR_LEFT_OR_ND_1V8 was zero... But more concerning, PP1V8_AON was zero... I guess that one is needed! [\/B]\n\nKeep you posted"
