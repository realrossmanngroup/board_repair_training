So tought lets ultrasonic to clean. And now I have a very dim image (apple logo) and then after 5 sec no image. Also after 30 sec, lcd comes on for 2 sec with backlight and image (login screen) but goes away. Thought maybe backlight issue orso but this is steady 43V until image dissapears. Figured out that everything goes black after <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> goes to 0v. \n\nWhy does <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> go to 0v??\n\nPlease advise."

When I press power button, the screen comes up with backlight etc... but after  5 sec goes away. And comes back again when I press power. Also when I firs connect power you hear chime, if I press power I have an Apple logo with backlight. Goes away after 5 sec! \n\nPs. This only works when power is connected not on batt?!? \n\nCould it have something to do with open lid sensor? Maybe the MacBook thinks the lid is closed.\n\n[B]Haha, after writing this down, I thought let me have look wat voltage open lid was giving. JR200 <SIGNAL>AMR_LEFT_OR_ND_1V8</SIGNAL> was zero... But more concerning, <SIGNAL>PP1V8_AON</SIGNAL> was zero... I guess that one is needed! [/B]\n\nKeep you posted"
