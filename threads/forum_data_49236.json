        "P5VS4RS3_EN": "What is P5VS4RS3_EN? PP5VS4RS3_EN is a signal that enables the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail. When you see _EN in front of a signal name, it means that it is enabling whatever comes before the _EN when the signal is high..",
        "U7500": "What is U7500? a CHIP.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "P5VS4RS3_EN_R": "What is P5VS4RS3_EN_R? P5VS4RS3_EN_R is an enable signal that turns on the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. The _R means the signal is asserted when the voltage is high(3.3v). .",
        "P5VS4RS3_PGOOD": "What is P5VS4RS3_PGOOD? P5VS4RS3_PGOOD is a signal that confirms the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail is working properly. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
