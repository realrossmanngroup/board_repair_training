C1001. All of them have reference to the processor. As I say, I have seen quite a few of these now, so is the processor a common failing and ending up shorted to ground or am I missing something?\nThanks"}

A short on C1001 is probably not a short at all. Low resistance on Vcore rails is not anything strange, compare to a good board. Vcore can many times only be a few Ohms to GND."}
