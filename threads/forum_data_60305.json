The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely.

Only the cpu lines where lower at around 18ohm but im sure that's very normal. \n\nI'm yet to check pages 57/58.\n\nWhat i did do was a SMC bypass, and now the pulses are way longer, for example the fan was barely trying to spin, now it goes to full speed before it turns down.\n\nThanks very much for the help, i'm going to inspect pages 57/58 (any advice in what to look first at?) and i'll let you know.\n\n\n\nCheers!"

I did put some good flux on it, heat it up slowly until it floated, tapped it with the tweezers, made it dance around with the hot air, and let it cool down. No change was observe to the behaviour of the voltages' pulses.\n\n\nI've found a little bit of corrosion arround <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> area. Not color spots or formations, but dark resistors.  <RESISTOR>R6115</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R6128</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R6126</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R6125</RESISTOR> have all one end too dark. I've measured them all and the traces and they seem to be good, don't know if trouble there can relate to the symptoms of the logic board.\n\nAgain any help is much appreciated. I understand this board can be on the hard one's to fix, so i may put it on the side for a bit. \nI will be posting others that might be way easier to fix soon.\n\nThanks in advance!"
