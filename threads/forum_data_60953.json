        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "P3V3SUS_EN": "What is P3V3SUS_EN? P3V3SUS_EN is a signal that turns on the PP3V3_SUS power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high..",
        "PM_PWRBTN": "What is PM_PWRBTN? PM_PWRBTN refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop..",
        "POM_RSMRST_L": "What is POM_RSMRST_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence.."

Tech had to do SMC reset, for it to turn on. After that, the no image issue, was caused by the LVDS cable. Tech installed the cable, ran a diagnostic. Everything seemed to be working okay. When client came in, the unit wouldnt turn on at all. No liquid damage\n\n[B]Current State: [/B]\nCurrent via DCPS is 17mA. It does respond to the power button, by jumping to 150mA then dropping back to 17mA. It does respond to SMC reset, but not to SMC bypass mode\n\n[B]Measurements I've Taken: [/B]\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>=12v59\n<SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL>=3v4\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL>=3v3\n<SIGNAL>P3V3SUS_EN</SIGNAL>=3v3\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>=3v3\n<SIGNAL>POM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL>=3v3\n<SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN</SIGNAL>=3v3\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>=0v0\n\nWhat other lines do I need before I have <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>?"
