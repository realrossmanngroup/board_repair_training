            "message": "On the bench I have an otherwise pristine <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00163</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> logic board. The original issue was the KB needed to be replaced. I replaced the KB, all of the keys work but the CAPS lock light does not. The customer REALLY wants the light to work, so before you tell me to tell them to just live with it, lets just say that is not an option. So far, I have replaced <CHIP>U4820</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q4840</TRANSISTOR>, checked <RESISTOR>R4814</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R4815</RESISTOR>. I have also tried 3 different keyboards, same result. I put a different logic board in the chassis and the caps lock light does indeed work in the machine so I know it is a board issue. Everything seems to be in order yet the light still does not work. Does anyone have any other Ideas where to look? I am at my wits end with this as it seems to be such a simple thing."
