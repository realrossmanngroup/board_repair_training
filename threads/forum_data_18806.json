Looks like its labelled R5400 on the schematic.\n\nTried removing U5450 (brd) U5400 (schematic) no change\n\nInjecting voltage it took 2A and 0.6v and Q7430 got boiling hot, i removed it but the short still remains. \n\nAny suggestions gratefully received."}

Resistance (not diode mode) between pins 1 on 7310 and 7320 and PPBUS_G3H (F7140) is 22ohms. Diode mode voltage drop to ground on pins 1&2 of L7310 and L7320 is 0.012v"}
