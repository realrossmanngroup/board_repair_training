Looks like its labelled <RESISTOR>R5400</RESISTOR> on the schematic.\n\nTried removing <CHIP>U5450</CHIP> (brd) <CHIP>U5400</CHIP> (schematic) no change\n\nInjecting voltage it took 2A and 0.6v and <TRANSISTOR>Q7430</TRANSISTOR> got boiling hot, i removed it but the short still remains. \n\nAny suggestions gratefully received."
