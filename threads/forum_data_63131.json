        "A1706": "What is A1706? A1706 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3071, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00239, 820-00923..",
        "820-00923": "What is 820-00923? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "ONOFF_L": "What is ONOFF_L? This is a abbreviation of SMC_ONOFF_L.When you see ONOFF_L, assume they meant to type SMC_ONOFF_L.",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3H_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3H_SCL? a SIGNAL.",

            "message": "Hi there. I have a liquid damaged unit here. 2016 13\"MBP 1706 (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00923</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>)\nIt originally had a no power issue due to issues one of the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s. I resolved that issue by cleaning up the areas that were corroded and then tested all capacitors and resistors. The board was now able to power up but J4900 (touch ID/power connector) was severely corroded so I replaced the connector. The cable end of the button was also corroded but just needed cleaning up. I was not able to get the button to function after repairing these two areas. I decided to try a different Touch ID/Power button. While removing the old button I accidentally pulled too fast and tore the cable. The button ended up being far too corroded to be usable. I attached the new power button but was still getting the same result of no function.\n\nFunny thing is I am still able to do SMC reset holding OPT-CTRL-SHIFT-PWR, so the button is definitely doing something.... If I press and hold the button while the machine is powered up the OS will not recognize the button press.\n\nAlso of note. If I disconnect the battery and then reconnect, then plug in power cable, The macbook will not automatically boot. The charger goes to 20A, 6-700mA, then to 5V 0A and stays there (fully charged battery). I can only turn on the board if I do a SMC reset following connecting power."
