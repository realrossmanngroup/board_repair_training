        "message":"Hi there. I have a liquid damaged unit here. 2016 13\"MBP 1706 (820-00923)\nIt originally had a no power issue due to issues one of the CD3215's. I resolved that issue by cleaning up the areas that were corroded and then tested all capacitors and resistors. The board was now able to power up but J4900 (touch ID\/power connector) was severely corroded so I replaced the connector. The cable end of the button was also corroded but just needed cleaning up. I was not able to get the button to function after repairing these two areas. I decided to try a different Touch ID\/Power button. While removing the old button I accidentally pulled too fast and tore the cable. The button ended up being far too corroded to be usable. I attached the new power button but was still getting the same result of no function.\n\nFunny thing is I am still able to do SMC reset holding OPT-CTRL-SHIFT-PWR, so the button is definitely doing something.... If I press and hold the button while the machine is powered up the OS will not recognize the button press.\n\nAlso of note. If I disconnect the battery and then reconnect, then plug in power cable, The macbook will not automatically boot. The charger goes to 20A, 6-700mA, then to 5V 0A and stays there (fully charged battery). I can only turn on the board if I do a SMC reset following connecting power."

This is with the board out of the unit, bare. I have tried all four ports with same result. No shorts on SMBUS_SMC_5_G3H_SDA or SMBUS_SMC_5_G3H_SCL either. battery connector is clean. Tried connecting to battery and wont charge battery either."
