Probably a measurement issue, because 9 times out of 10 I get 0V, and 1 out of 10 a nice 40V on each pin\nI do have 3.342V on pin 4, 6 and 7\n\nI checked <RESISTOR>R9010</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R9011</RESISTOR>, they both are at 4.5kOhms\nThese two resistances read 100kOhms on another similar MacBook (which does not turn on)\n\nCan it be an issue there ?\n\nI tested with another screen : no backlight, but picture."
