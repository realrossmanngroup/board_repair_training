Probably a measurement issue, because 9 times out of 10 I get 0V, and 1 out of 10 a nice 40V on each pin\nI do have 3.342V on pin 4, 6 and 7\n\nI checked R9010 and R9011, they both are at 4.5kOhms\nThese two resistances read 100kOhms on another similar MacBook (which does not turn on)\n\nCan it be an issue there ?\n\nI tested with another screen : no backlight, but picture."}
