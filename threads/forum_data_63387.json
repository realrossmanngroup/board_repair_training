Then shut down and wouldn't stay on. i realized it will only stay on with trackpad unplugged. I tried replacing Trackpad and the TP cable. Replaced U4850.  Then noticed something pulling down SMC ON_OFF when trackpad plugged in. Removed C4810. Checked R4810 and R5170. Replaced U5110 and the SMC. It still shuts down after about 8 seconds and restarts UNLESS I unplug the trackpad."}

However, I just realized that something I changed of the previous fixed the SMC_ON_OFF issue and  in addition a new battery has now solved it from rebooting."}
