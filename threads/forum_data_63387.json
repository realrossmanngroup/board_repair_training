Replaced <CHIP>U4850</CHIP>.  Then noticed something pulling down SMC <SIGNAL>ON_OFF</SIGNAL> when trackpad plugged in. Removed <CAPACITOR>C4810</CAPACITOR>. Checked <RESISTOR>R4810</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5170</RESISTOR>. Replaced <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and the SMC. It still shuts down after about 8 seconds and restarts UNLESS I unplug the trackpad."
