        "820-3435": "What is 820-3435? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "S4_PWR_EN": "What is S4_PWR_EN? S4_PWR_EN turns on the S4 power rails. Signals ending in _EN enable whatever came before _EN in the signal name when the voltage of the signal is high. .",

        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. ."

            "message": "This 3435 came in dead. Upon opening i see a burned hole in the battery. Disconnected battery but still not turning on on AC. Checking PBUS is only 0.9V. <TRANSISTOR>Q7560</TRANSISTOR> getting extremely hot. After replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q7560</TRANSISTOR> PBUS is 8.6V but still not turning on. Now <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> is missing (along with <SIGNAL>S4_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>). So checking <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is 3.33V but resistance is only 18 Ohm to GND(!) I removed L7560 to see which side has this low resistance. Upon removing L7560 I see it has also been very hot because it has a little burn mark under it. The 18 Ohm resistance is on pin2 side of L7560. I injected 3.3V into this pin and ramp up bench supply to 10A. But nothing getting hot and only drawing 0.4A. So I got a \"semi\"-short and I don't know how to find it.\n\nIdeas ?"

Throw it in the freezer for about a minute so everything is a little colder than normal and then check under the IR camera again (assuming you have one).\n\nAre there any ugly burnt areas or craters in the board? Lots of times these partial shorts are due to board damage."
