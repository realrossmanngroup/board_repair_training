            "message": "Hi I am new to this but have had successes with older boards. This time is my first attempt at a retina board. I have managed to get most of the equipment Louis recommends including the Quick hot air station.\n\nI-have tried to remove the <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> using the quick with a range of nozzles straight and bent at different settings but the chip wont budge. I thought this may be due to the heat sink on the other side sucking up the heat from chips ground plane as one of the securing screw is very close to the chip. I have removed heat sink and it still wont come off.\nI have removed a a similar package chip from a different board and it came off fine. Unfortunately I don't have a donor board to try removal on.\n\nAny sugestion would be appreciated Thanks"
