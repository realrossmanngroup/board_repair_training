It's not hard to do at all. Just a case of reading the chip, saving the read as a file on your desktop, opening the file in a hex editor and searching $SVS and replacing the string with 0xFF (which is = zero in base 10). Write back to the chip and slap it back on the board.\n\n1, Buy yourself a programmer like a tl866 (£30- £50 on eBay)\n2, Go read this post and read from just below the last image of the logic board: [URL=\"https://ghostlyhaks.com/blog/apple-efi/18-how-to-hack-apple-efi-2\"]https://ghostlyhaks.com/blog/apple-e...ck-apple-efi-2[/URL]\n\n\nWhat you DO NOT DO is just replace the BIOS chip for another one because the ME region (management engine region) is tied to that one and only CPU. When an iCore computer is started up of the first time ever the BIOS identifies that CPU and is basically married to it. In order to swap a BIOS chip you have to \"clean\" the management engine region of the firmware. Better to just zero out the password and then install a fresh OS to the SSD.\n\nOh, you'll probably need to make an account with the forum to read full content.\n\n......People do not generally forget their own EFI passwords........?"
