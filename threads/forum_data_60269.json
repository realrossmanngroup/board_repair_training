    "definitions": {
        "A1304": "What is A1304? A1304 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Mid 2009 with EMC 2334, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2375..",
        "820-2375": "What is 820-2375? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",
        "SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "PP1V05_S5": "What is PP1V05_S5? PP1V05_S5 is a 1.05v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. On 2008-2009 15” and 17” Macbook boards, this often gets stuck at 0.3v due to a bad C7771 capacitor. .",
        "SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL is another way to say SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL, look at the definition provided for SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL as it applies to .",
        "BATT_POS": "What is BATT_POS? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_VDD": "What is CHGR_VDD? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "PP3V3_LCDVDD_SW": "What is PP3V3_LCDVDD_SW? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_LCDVDD_SW_F": "What is PP3V3_LCDVDD_SW_F? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S0_LCD_F": "What is PP3V3_S0_LCD_F? a SIGNAL."
