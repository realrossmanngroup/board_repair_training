Opened up iMac and discovered a noticeable burn in the thunderbolt IC U2800. The part number is DSL3510L and I have this same IC on a donor 820-3437 MBA L2013. My question is, is it even possible to replace the Thunderbolt IC, or is the firmware paired to the CPU somehow since it uses PCIe lane.\n\nI have attached an image of the burn in the thunderbolt IC."}
