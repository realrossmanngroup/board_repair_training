The part number is DSL3510L and I have this same IC on a donor <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> MBA L2013. My question is, is it even possible to replace the Thunderbolt IC, or is the firmware paired to the CPU somehow since it uses PCIe lane.\n\nI have attached an image of the burn in the thunderbolt IC."
