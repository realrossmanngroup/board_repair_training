This may be because of removing <CHIP>U8100</CHIP>? However in the process, I knocked a few other components around <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> off. So I will be cleaning the area, reballing <CHIP>U8100</CHIP>, then sticking back all the components. I did however decide to take back up <TRANSISTOR>Q5800</TRANSISTOR> (after having removed <CHIP>U8100</CHIP>) cause the solder did not look so great anymore. In doing so, I did see some of the solder under <TRANSISTOR>Q5800</TRANSISTOR> looked somewhat grainy. I wonder if this may have been the issue? I keep going back to <TRANSISTOR>Q5800</TRANSISTOR> because voltage in is at 12v, but voltage going to pins 6/7/8 are off. This appears to me to be an issue?\nYour thoughts/knowledge?"
