Everything looks clean, no visible liquid damage.\nUSB-C meter is stuck at 5v. I have isolated the issue to PPBUS_AON by removing F5200\/01.\nWhen both fuses are removed I get 12.59v on PPVBAT_AON_CHGR_REG, but on the PPBUS_AON I get 1.42 which slowly drops.\nWhen these fuses are back on, I get 6.78v something is pulling it down, .93 amps are being drawn according to the USB-C meter and U8100 is getting quite hot with fuses back in place. It seems like I got a problem with PPBUS_AON but I cannot figure out what the problem is."}

This is also measuring in diode mode @ that .066.\nBelow images show U8100, and that row of capacitors above U5700. Is U8100 fried?
