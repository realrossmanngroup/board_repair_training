I have isolated the issue to PPBUS_AON by removing F5200\/01.\nWhen both fuses are removed I get 12.59v on PPVBAT_AON_CHGR_REG, but on the PPBUS_AON I get 1.42 which slowly drops.\nWhen these fuses are back on, I get 6.78v something is pulling it down, .93 amps are being drawn according to the USB-C meter and U8100 is getting quite hot with fuses back in place. It seems like I got a problem with PPBUS_AON but I cannot figure out what the problem is."

Pin 4 and pin 3 were at first pulsing 1.4v to 1.5 but now those same pins are .500 thru .200 volts.\nYea, measuring again, it has gotta be on the PPVIN_P3V8AON_ISNS side of things. Maybe my donor board chip u5700 was bad, not sure. I will try to isolate the problem further.\nAnother update: I removed U5700 again, and I am now getting 3.8v at rd590 pin 1, so this is indeed a bad U5700?\nAnother update: I decided to remove Q5840, Q5820, and Q5800. When I did this, PPVIN_P3V8AON_ISNS went back to the 12.6v. R5840 seems to be a connection somewhere here.\nUpdate: P3V8AON_SW1 I am getting 1.46v, and diode mode reads .025, should be .356. I have already replaced, and reflowed U5700. Bad Q5800?\nJust replaced Q8500 and now I have a short to ground on P3V8AON_VSW1. When I inject voltage the U8100 chip gets warm just like it always has.

Where would you look to next then knowing this?\nWith L5800\/20 both removed and L5840 back on, L5800 pin 1 is flucuating constantly from 4.7v to 5.7v."

        "message":"Okay, let me bounce this off you then if I may. Since I removed U8100, the up and down voltage on L5800 pad 1 is now for the most part stable at 3.9v. This may be because of removing U8100? However in the process, I knocked a few other components around U8100 off. So I will be cleaning the area, reballing U8100, then sticking back all the components. I did however decide to take back up Q5800 (after having removed U8100) cause the solder did not look so great anymore. In doing so, I did see some of the solder under Q5800 looked somewhat grainy. I wonder if this may have been the issue? I keep going back to Q5800 because voltage in is at 12v, but voltage going to pins 6\/7\/8 are off. This appears to me to be an issue?\nYour thoughts\/knowledge?"
