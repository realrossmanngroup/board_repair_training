            "message": "Hi, First time repairing an iPhone 6(s) here.\n\nI bought a iPhone 6s from a seller with what was told a broken screen, so I assumed it was just a screen replacement job or at worst replacing the backlight filter or whatever they managed to break.\nHowever from what it looks like the phone has been worked on before (some parts are pretty ugly soldered, but working though) however I think, I [B]hope[/B] they gave up once they had to remove the shields. I can't compare it with an actually untouched 6(s) since I've never seen one with my own eyes.\n\nThe issue is that the backlight (I think) is not being boosted, <SIGNAL>PP_LCM_BL_ANODE</SIGNAL> (which should be 35V following the schematic) is exactly the same as <SIGNAL>VCC_MAIN</SIGNAL> (which was about ~3.33V, IIRC).\n\nIs it possible one of the coils decided to stop boosting and just straight on pass <SIGNAL>VCC_MAIN</SIGNAL>? Might the <CHIP>U4020</CHIP> chip be the issue of it all? I have no idea where to look, anyone any ideas/tips?\n\nThis is how the area looks: [URL]https://i.imgur.com/l5qZZvJ.jpg[/URL]\n\nThanks in advance!"

I just gave it a very small touch with my tweezers and it fell right off.\n\nThere was definitely someone here before because the pads and their solder looked like crap, they were almost ripped off / destroyed. I removed the old solder and tried to move the pads back with success.\n\nThen I soldered <DIODE>D4021</DIODE> back on and, done! The backlight is properly functioning again\n\nI'm unsure if <DIODE>D4021</DIODE> would've been the actual issue though, its an important part, but would it cause the backlight not to boost? I want to make sure I actually fixed the issue not just because I applied heat in that area"
