The previous apparently did not make it worth since it's doing the same thing.\n\nI am getting the following messages in verbose before it restarts:\n\n- Failed to wake the ME\n- Begin GFX firmware load process\n\nAnd these messages will repeat themselves.\n\nSeeing \"ME\" in the logs + having the bios reworked, I am assuming the Bios was messed up and replaced with one from another board without the ME region being cleaned up.\nI would like to rule that out first before assuming there could be a fault with the GPU (as can be seen with the following message)\n\nCan you please clean the ME region for me on this bios: [URL]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/123yLS9KLLxrOOqSwCRLEmKg-PDEW_D3k\/view?usp=sharing[\/URL]\nThank you in advance."}
