            "message": "Ive gone through the MacBook Air Backlight Repair lifeline that Louis posted however this problem seems to extend beyond the simpler solutions. The Backlight and LCD work fine most of the time, I get 3.34V on <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> and I found 2 resistors that were a little out of spec so I replaced them (<RESISTOR>R7715</RESISTOR> / <RESISTOR>R7731</RESISTOR>) along with the LED driver as I was worried it was shorting a rail to ground intermittently. The computer runs fine most of the time however it randomly cuts the backlight in and out, when the backlight is off the <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> rail drops to 0 v. Also sometimes the only thing that drops out is backlight and the LCD stays on but is just dark, however sometimes the entire screen goes dead and then comes back on randomly.\n\nI also forgot that there was some corrosion around <CHIP>U3210</CHIP>, <CHIP>U3220</CHIP>, and <TRANSISTOR>Q5510</TRANSISTOR>. I did localized reflows with flux before cleaning in the Crest first, then further investigated and replaced the resistors and LED driver."

With the IO Cable connected I still get the same 2.65 V and this time I was actually able to watch it drop down as low as 1.73 V at one point and of course the backlight was cutting on and off.

Even though the voltage goes up the backlight problems persist.\n\n<RESISTOR>R5171</RESISTOR> is 99k ohm\n\n<CAPACITOR>C4835</CAPACITOR> looks very good and is not shorted measured at Pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C4835</CAPACITOR> I get 0.727 V in diode mode."
