Tried a replacement screen and also replaced the cable as it was seriously burnt \/ corroded but no luck.\nOnly one of the USB C ports works at the moment the other one just keeps blinking the AMP\/Volt meter.\nI get output to an external screen but no video on the built in LCD ( I think there is backlight but no video)\n\nWhat should I measure as I am at a loss.\nThanks"
