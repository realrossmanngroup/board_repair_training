        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",

        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

No short\n<RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> is ok, 0 ohm, 20 volts\n<RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7061</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7062</RESISTOR> is 1 Ohm as it should be\n<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> and 7040 as i said is already changed\n\nIs it something else can pull the line to the groung, or <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> still doesn't work properly by some reason?"
