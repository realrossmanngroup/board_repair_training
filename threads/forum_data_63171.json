It worked fine for a week and suddenly start running the fans on loud again. Intermittently it would calm down and then again would blast the fans with the same lagging. Other times would work and play videos with no issues for days. \n\nCan't spot any corrosion on the board, although the customer mentioned spillage on the mac a long time ago. The keyboard works fine.\n\nWondering if anyone experienced or has points where to look for?"

Any idea where these sensors could be on the board (<TRANSISTOR>Q5502</TRANSISTOR> / <CHIP>U5570</CHIP> seems to be a candidate) and how to measure them in the case? Measuring without tpad/kbd will it affect? Usually, fans go loud when run outside of the case.\n\n\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"1665614340517.png\"]60820[/ATTACH]"
