The keyboard (new and old) will only work if I hold the key a little bit.\n\nI checked <SIGNAL>WS_KBD</SIGNAL> and all of them are fluctuating a lot between 0.5 to 3 volts. Never consistent. Connector looks clean and the <CHIP>U5701</CHIP> area looks clean. Has the controller failed? Should I check elsewhere? <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3_PSOC</SIGNAL> pin 49 and 22 of <CHIP>U5701</CHIP> is 3.3 volts.\n\nPlease advise, thanks in advance."

I am having some difficult sourcing out the part online. Now everything is pointing back to a controller issue which I replaced 3-4 times already."
