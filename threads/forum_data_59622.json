Tested new keyboard \/ trackpad and still not working. The keyboard (new and old) will only work if I hold the key a little bit.\n\nI checked WS_KBD and all of them are fluctuating a lot between 0.5 to 3 volts. Never consistent. Connector looks clean and the U5701 area looks clean. Has the controller failed? Should I check elsewhere? PP3V3_S3_PSOC pin 49 and 22 of U5701 is 3.3 volts.\n\nPlease advise, thanks in advance."}

When I disconnect the trackpad flex cable, the WS_KBDx signals are steady and the keyboard is very responsive. As soon as I reconnect the trackpad + flex cable, it jumps up and down. When I leave the trackpad flex connected and disconnect the actual trackpad from the flex cable, the WS_KBDx signals are steady. Tried new trackpad + new flex cable.\n\nLooks like I'll need to order a trackpad connector and try that out."}

I was convinced that maybe something was in the TP connector (because why all of a sudden is it acting like this after reconnecting flex cable several times?) so I ended up removing it.\n\nNow that it has been removed, it's still fluctuating with no keyboard connected, no TP connected (obviously) and now I have a board with no TP connector! I am having some difficult sourcing out the part online. Now everything is pointing back to a controller issue which I replaced 3-4 times already."}
