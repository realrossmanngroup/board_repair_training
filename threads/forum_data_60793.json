        "message":"Hello,\n\nI received a MacBook with keyboard and trackpad issue. There was water damage on the trackpad connector and keyboard itself which I replaced both already. I also found that the R4830 pull-up resistor for the 3.3v to pin 10 was fried and giving 0 volts. Replaced the resistor and the keyboard \/ trackpad started working. However, after a few minutes of it working, the keys would stop. Only if I hold the keys for 1-2 seconds would the keys register and I would have to restart the computer in order for it to work normally for 1-2 minutes and then it would stop working again. Has anyone experienced something similar before?"
