Do diode mode on C9040 and friends on pin 1 which is the MUX side. Then check from pin 2 to the other side of a plugged in LCD cable. If that is all good it could be a MUX issue U9200. Check diode mode on C9240 and friends on both sides and inspect for damage around U9200.\nHave you tried if external video is working, if not then it could be something totally different of course."}
