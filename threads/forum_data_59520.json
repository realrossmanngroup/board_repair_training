        "message":"Hello. I have a 820-00923 that was liquid damaged but it has been previously worked on and cleaned so I don't know where exactly the liquid damage was. Amp meter shows 5v 0.03a on all 4 ports, but 2 of the ports power cycle every couple seconds and then other 2 do not. I know if the port shows steady 5v instead of cycling, that there is an issue on the corresponding CD3215 chip, but I have replaced both CD3215 chips for the ports that are steady 5v and have gotten no change. I replaced each one twice just to be safe but they still show steady 5v 0.03a. Diode mode values on each of the CD3215 chips seem similar so not sure where to check next. Here are some voltage and diode mode measurements.\n\nU3100 (Steady 5v):\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.32v - 0.337\nPP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS - 5.17v - 0.16\nPP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO - 3.29v - 0.476   \nPP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOA - 1.78v - 0.484\nPP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOD - 1.8v - 0.449\nPP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC - 0v - 0.464\n\nU3200 (5v loop):\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.34v - 0.337\nPP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS - 5.17v - 0.16\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO - 3.29v - 0.476\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA - 1.8v - 0.491\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD - 1.8v - 0.457\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC - 1.1v - 0.47\n\nUB300 (5v loop):\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.34v - 0.337\nPP20V_USBC_TA_VBUS - 5.17v - 0.159\nPP3V3_UPC_TA_LDO - 3.3v - 0.476\nPP1V8_UPC_TA_LDOA - 1.8v - 0.492\nPP1V8_UPC_TA_LDOD - 1.8v - 0.459\nPP1V1_UPC_TA_LDO_BMC - 1.1v - 0.476\n\nUB400 (Steady 5v):\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.34v - 0.337\nPP20V_USBC_TB_VBUS - 5.1v - 0.159\nPP3V3_UPC_TB_LDO - 3.28v - 0.475\nPP1V8_UPC_TB_LDOA - 1.8v - 0.511\nPP1V8_UPC_TB_LDOD - 1.8v - 0.472\nPP1V1_UPC_TB_LDO_BMC - 1.1v - 0.496"
