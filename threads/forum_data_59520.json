I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00923</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that was liquid damaged but it has been previously worked on and cleaned so I don't know where exactly the liquid damage was. Amp meter shows 5v 0.03a on all 4 ports, but 2 of the ports power cycle every couple seconds and then other 2 do not. I know if the port shows steady 5v instead of cycling, that there is an issue on the corresponding <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> chip, but I have replaced both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> chips for the ports that are steady 5v and have gotten no change. I replaced each one twice just to be safe but they still show steady 5v 0.03a. Diode mode values on each of the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> chips seem similar so not sure where to check next.
