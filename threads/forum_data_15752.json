I have a schematic for it, but no board view. Is there a board view anywhere for it? The schematic says it needs 20v, but I only have a normal 85w charger for MacBook Pro which is a lower voltage, so is there another type of MacBook Pro charger which is a higher voltage? When connecting what I have the light on it goes green then red as though it is charging so what gives?\nThanks"

Cannot find <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> yet, but may have found <CHIP>U8330</CHIP>. Putting <CHIP>U8330</CHIP> aside, pin 28 39 and 30 are shorted to ground, so is  L8300 and, I am guessing everything that goes back to at least <CHIP>U8300</CHIP>. Looking for other voltages going to the lcd connector, there should be 3.3v going to pin 5. There is nothing there and it is not shorting to ground, any voltages tested up to now have been tested with lcd connected nd disconnected.\nStill looking"
