I have a schematic for it, but no board view. Is there a board view anywhere for it? The schematic says it needs 20v, but I only have a normal 85w charger for MacBook Pro which is a lower voltage, so is there another type of MacBook Pro charger which is a higher voltage? When connecting what I have the light on it goes green then red as though it is charging so what gives?\nThanks"}

I just answered the question and never thought about the answer. Ok so R7121 and R7122 and 10 Ohm each and looking at the schematic they are in series so adding them together, between pin 27 and 28 should give 20 Ohms. 0.909 is pretty much open circuit so something has burnt out. I say this as I am guessing R7120 has something to do with the circuit and probably burnt out unless a track is burnt out. I have guessed the location of R7121 and R7122 and am hopefully correct due to the readings I got. Where is R7120 though?"}
