This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. ."

It had <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> si i fixed it, after that i connected everything and it started workin. Green light and everything but after minutes it turned off. No green light or orange, anyways i took off the dc in board flex cable that is connected to board and it started working again. What could be wrong?"

            "message": "The only good answer is you need to have known-good test DC boards and cables for Airs. It'll cost you about $30 total. Too many variables otherwise. Those cables love to fail too so your case just sounds like a bad cable. Sadly, I haven't really seen too much in the way of schematics and board views for those DC-In boards, but they do exist."

See? Same thing.\n\nI have, for people who were absolutely too impatient to wait for the fucking dc in board/dc in board flex to arrive, just ran magnet wire from the motherboard over to the dc in board. You can do it too if you don't have the cable or a new dc in board. Just \"fix\" the dc in board that you have.\n\nThis rules oe ut bad dc in board, dc in flex, and dc in connector on the actual motherboard."
