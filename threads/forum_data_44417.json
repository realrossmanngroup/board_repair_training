        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",

Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state.

The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

I suspect their is a chance it was not quite dry under the CPU/RAM/any of the BGA chips, and it might need a second cleaning. <SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL> is one of the sleep signals that enables the PCH to turn on, and it comes directly from the SMC. Usually, when that is missing, we have seen the 2015 boards refuse to put it out if the charger is not 100% the correct OEM charger it needs. It is also possible that something could be pulling it down or not creating it (SMC, CPU etc). This can sometimes happen due to crap under the CPU/SMC as well."
