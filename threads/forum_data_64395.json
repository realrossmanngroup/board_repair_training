Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution.

Everything seemed ok after I removed a couple of the components and put them back in order to check some of the values you asked me to check.\n\nThe problem I now have with the board is one that I previously had but had somehow attributed it to <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> but realise now it had nothing to do with that and that I had replaced it unnecessarily, and thereby caused the above problems.\n\nI found that L8750 had pretty much melted into the board, taken out CC774 and CC775 with it. The <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> pads on all three of those components are gone.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> at the moment reads 5V.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_S3</SIGNAL> however is only 0.053 in diode mode (151 ohms to ground) and I'm not sure how to go about troubleshooting this. I have removed <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C8102</CAPACITOR> and injected 1v into <SIGNAL>PP1V1_S3</SIGNAL> but nothing lit up under the thermal camera and only 0.01a was drawn on the DCPS.
