        "message":"I'm back working on this board after the Christmas break. I got the U7000 problem sorted out and back at 20v. Everything seemed ok after I removed a couple of the components and put them back in order to check some of the values you asked me to check.\n\nThe problem I now have with the board is one that I previously had but had somehow attributed it to U7000 but realise now it had nothing to do with that and that I had replaced it unnecessarily, and thereby caused the above problems.\n\nI found that L8750 had pretty much melted into the board, taken out CC774 and CC775 with it. The PP5V_G3S pads on all three of those components are gone.\n\nPP5V_G3S at the moment reads 5V.\n\nPP1V1_S3 however is only 0.053 in diode mode (151 ohms to ground) and I'm not sure how to go about troubleshooting this. I have removed U8100 and C8102 and injected 1v into PP1V1_S3 but nothing lit up under the thermal camera and only 0.01a was drawn on the DCPS. Any ideas?"
