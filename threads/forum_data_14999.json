They are both working some of the time and suddenly freeze up. There are always clicking on the trackpad but both trackpad and keyboard works sporadically.  I haven' got schematics or boardview for this and I don't even know if they exist for us to get hold of. Are there schematics for this board? Power button on keyboard works all the time.\n\nThe board was water damaged but I can't see any corrosion on it, only one red sensor."
