        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "PP3V3_SW_LCD": "What is PP3V3_SW_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVOUT_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_LCDBKLT is the backlight power rail that is responsible for creating a backlight o nthe screen. .",
        "PP5V_SW_LCD": "What is PP5V_SW_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "I2C_BKLT_SCL": "What is I2C_BKLT_SCL? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground."
