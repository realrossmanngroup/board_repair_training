            "message": "Hello friends,\nGot another macbook air in with liquid damage after another shop...\nThere was some, minor water sign on the board, however not sure if there was more before the other shop played with it (overall the board do appear clean: no flux etc)\n\nAfter cleaning and plugging the power, there is 20v and 0.17amps, however there is some strange \"clicking\"/\"cracking\" noise coming from the board. Can't confirm from where exactly, but most probably from VRMs. After looking for voltage and resistance on coils, it appear that there is 3 shorted coils and no voltage on them. Cant be sure where those are going since didnt found the board view (any one have them by any chances?) But i presume that those are for the cpu. What is strange is that the cpu get warm witch lead me to belive that those coils might be for something else. Any tips please?"
