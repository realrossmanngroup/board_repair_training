[U]Does this board need the keyboard\/trackpad plugged in to make the rest of the rails work?[\/U]\nI have replaced many things so far, I don't have the complete list, but the board history is this was a parts board which did have some liquid damage.\n\nI have replaced: U7501, L7520, U7100.

While I had Q7520 up from the board, Q7430 also got hot (thermal cam), but is not getting hot anymore, but pin 1 is 8.57,  Pin 3 builds up to .40 but then drops quickly."}
