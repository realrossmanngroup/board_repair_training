        "message":"Hello!\n\nI have a 820-2530 that won't boot. It turns on, but the screen remains blank and there is no chime. No keyboard backlight also.\nI removed the RAM and it won't beep.\nWhen I turn it on after a while, it turns off by itself after a couple of seconds and then turns on again, then it stays on. The fan spins at 100% and doesn't slow down. CPU and GPU warm up.\n\nLooked over the board and couldn't see any corrosion \/ water damage. In fact, it's surprisingly clean.\n\nAny ideas where to start with this? Thanks!"

If this does not help then it is probably a bad MCP or it was dropped. Also go over the board for possible knocked off components.\nIs there any history on this board?"

        "message":"Resistors will always measure lower in circuit because there are multiple pathways inside the board for power to get from point A to point B. Resistors usually fail by going open circuit where the resistance is higher rather than lower so that is probably fine. To confirm you can remove the resistor from the board and measure it off the board but then it flies away into the fifth dimension to never be found so I usually don't advise this."
