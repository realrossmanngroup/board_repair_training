Wine on the keyboard.\nTook the motherboard out, no signs of water damage inside. Try to boot but no sign of life.\nQuestion: With battery disconnected and type C adapter connected, does it start up automatically or only with the press of power button?\nNot having magsafe light  or schematics is really annoying.\nFound a white fuse that looks like adapter current fuse and it shows 5V or rails are 0V.\n\n\nTHanks!"
