        "A2289": "What is A2289? A2289 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2020 with EMC 3456, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01987..",
        "820-01987": "What is 820-01987? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP1V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V8_SLPS2R? PP1V8_SLPS2R is a 1.8v power rail present when the system is in a SLPS2R state. .",
        "PP1V2_S3": "What is PP1V2_S3? PP1V2_S3 is a 1.2v power rail present when the machine is in an S3 suspend to RAM state.",
        "PP1V8_S3": "What is PP1V8_S3? The PP1V8_S3 signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides a voltage of 1.8 volts during the S3 power state. The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",

        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance â€“ this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",
