    "definitions": {
        "A2289": "What is A2289? A2289 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2020 with EMC 3456, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01987..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP5V_G3S": "What is PP5V_G3S? PP5V_G3S is a 5v power rail present when the system is in a G3S standby state.",
        "PP1V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V8_SLPS2R? PP1V8_SLPS2R is a 1.8v power rail present when the system is in a SLPS2R state. .",
        "PP2V5_NAND_SSD0": "What is PP2V5_NAND_SSD0? PP2V5_NAND_SSD0 This is a power rail that powers the NAND on Macbooks where the solid state drive is soldered directly to the board. .",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V1_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V1_SLPS2R? The PP1V1_SLPS2R power rail in the MacBook schematic provides a 1.1-volt supply in a specific low-power state indicated by the \"_SLPS2R\" suffix and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP1V2_AWAKE": "What is PP1V2_AWAKE? The PP1V2_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides 1.2 volts and is associated with the machine's awake state and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP3V3_AWAKE": "What is PP3V3_AWAKE? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP0V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP0V8_SLPS2R? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVDDCPU_AWAKE": "What is PPVDDCPU_AWAKE? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP0V9_SSD0": "What is PP0V9_SSD0? This is a power rail for the soldered on SSD on newer Macbooks. .",
        "PPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0": "What is PPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP1V_PRIM": "What is PP1V_PRIM? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVPCORE_S5": "What is PPVPCORE_S5? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP0V95_S0_CPUVCCIO": "What is PP0V95_S0_CPUVCCIO? a SIGNAL.",
        "VCC_CORE": "What is VCC_CORE? a SIGNAL."
