It starts and boots normally but after the bar under the apple logo has reached ~50% it gets really slow. If i wait a few minutes the bar completes but it stays at the apple screen forever. The customer provided a picture of an error message. This includes the message\n\nAppleUSBHostPort::InterruptOccurred: overcurrent detected\n\nand other (for mee) confusing numbers. There was a little bit of flux by <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> but besides this and a warranty sticker the board looks fine. It also shows the same behaviour when i try to boot from a USB drive. I have no idea where to start on this one."
