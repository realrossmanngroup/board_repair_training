With board only out on the table, when I plug in a MS I get no PP3V42 but has a light, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 2.6V. On <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> I'm getting 18v on pins 4 & 7, but no <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>. I replaced <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> and at first it seemed to work, had MS light, PP3V42 was present as well as PPBUS. After a few min I tried to turn it back on and nothing. Just a fading green light.
