With board only out on the table, when I plug in a MS I get no PP3V42 but has a light, PPBUS_G3H is 2.6V. On U6990 I'm getting 18v on pins 4 & 7, but no PP3V42_G3H. I replaced U6990 and at first it seemed to work, had MS light, PP3V42 was present as well as PPBUS. After a few min I tried to turn it back on and nothing. Just a fading green light. It seemed like I fixed it but not back to not working. I tried to trigger SMC_ON\/OFF_L but nothing happened."}

I got PP3V42 and PPBUS to show up for a min, then it went away again. Also, the magsafe light fades away until I turn off then turn back on the power supply. Even when they showed up temporarily, no fan spin. I'm wondering if maybe something is pulling it down. Or if the SMC is bad."}
