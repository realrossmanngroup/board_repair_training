Bought a macbook pro to test and the parts I got are good on the test system. the tp feedback still works, not that it matters with this design, but 3.3v and 5v are also present. Afraid this is a bad solider joint somewhere on the I2C SCL\/SDA lines but am open to looking at other things. What would you look at first to narrow down the source cause here? I don't know how to test these signal lines."}
