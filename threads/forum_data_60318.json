Being that it runs for a while when trying to boot from external, I'm guessing that the internal hard drive has issues or maybe gpu?\n\nI havent worked on any T2 devices yet. From what I gather it appears you cannot swap parts out? \n\nAnyone worked on a 2018 mini with booting issues? It looks like it might be a common problem but I haven't seen a viable solution on the interwebs."

Activation lock was removed at the apple store according to the customer. He said this overheated and cut off and since then hasn't booted. \n\nSo what's the story on the T2?? Can components be swapped out or is everything coded to work with the t2 chip. I've seen there are ways supposedly to hack the t2."
