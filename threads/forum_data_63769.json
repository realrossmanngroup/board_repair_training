It slowed to a crawl, I tried a restart, it went through a couple of instances of the fan cycling and now just shows the charging indicator on the screen if holding a button down. This says to me that the battery supplies power to the computer fine, it‚Äôs a charging problem.\n\nIs there a way to charge the battery without going through the USBC port? This is my first MacBook repair and if I can charge the battery, I can get a backup before I do anything that might permanently Bork the computer."
