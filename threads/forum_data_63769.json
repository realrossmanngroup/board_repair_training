It slowed to a crawl, I tried a restart, it went through a couple of instances of the fan cycling and now just shows the charging indicator on the screen if holding a button down. This says to me that the battery supplies power to the computer fine, it\u2019s a charging problem.\n\nIs there a way to charge the battery without going through the USBC port? This is my first MacBook repair and if I can charge the battery, I can get a backup before I do anything that might permanently Bork the computer."}

There is a bad CD32 chip based on the fact that 3 out of 4 of the USB C connections cycle power. I can check those connections in your post when I get home but to be clear, I\u2019m not trying to solve that right now. I just want to be able to charge the battery without going through that chip. I was hoping there would be some hack to do that. \nIf I got another logic board with a working chip, I assume that would work but it seems like overkill."}
