Fan spins up.\nEvery power rail comes up for a sec except CPUVCORE.\nI tried different BIOS.\n\nI've 1.2V on on Y2605, but I can't see it oscillating. I changed the crystal and <CHIP>U2600</CHIP>. No change.\n\nChecked RTC circuit to PCH(<RESISTOR>R1800</RESISTOR>-<RESISTOR>R1803</RESISTOR>) and everything seems fine. \n\nNo short on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> or on S3 rails. <SIGNAL>SYSCLK_CLK32K_RTC</SIGNAL> is present.\n\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> goes high - 3.3V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> is present.\n\nChecked the resistors on the SPI line(<RESISTOR>R5110</RESISTOR>-<RESISTOR>R5112</RESISTOR>,<RESISTOR>R5123</RESISTOR>).\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nThank you."
