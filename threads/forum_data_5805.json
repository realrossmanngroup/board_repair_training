Fan spins up.\nEvery power rail comes up for a sec except CPUVCORE.\nI tried different BIOS.\n\nI've 1.2V on on Y2605, but I can't see it oscillating. I changed the crystal and U2600. No change.\n\nChecked RTC circuit to PCH(R1800-R1803) and everything seems fine. \n\nNo short on PP5V_S0 or on S3 rails. SYSCLK_CLK32K_RTC is present.\n\nALL_SYS_PWRGD goes high - 3.3V\n\nPP3V3_SUS is present.\n\nChecked the resistors on the SPI line(R5110-R5112,R5123).\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nThank you."}
