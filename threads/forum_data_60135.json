            "message": "Hello, i have this macbook air here <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> which was dead, clean no signs of water anywhere. Found out with some help that <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> was low (0.9v) and replaced <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and this voltage got back to it's normal value. Got green and orange light on magsafe, it booted but was sluggish to death. diagnostics says everything is ok, recovery environment is awefully slow and it's unusable in the os.\n\nI have to keep power down for a long time for it to boot, after the chime otherwise it shuts down. \n\nLeft it charging and it went dead again, so i tried replacing again <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>, but it didn't change anything. New to these things, i'm not sure where to go from here. Thanks in advance!"
