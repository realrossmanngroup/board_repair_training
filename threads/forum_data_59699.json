I've done this multiple times without issue. \nThis time while using Medusa 3 tool I got an error. Tried re applying SN, \"Fsys Block not found\". Clean ME region - failed. (board still worked at this point). \nReplaced BIOS form same board. Fan still spun. \nUsed Medusa to clean ME region while out of mac by shorting <RESISTOR>R5116</RESISTOR>. This was successful but now the board is dead. Magsafe green>orange. \nReplaced ROM again with no change.. \n\nWhat did I do?"
