Board was working but customer wanted SN changed to match. I've done this multiple times without issue. \nThis time while using Medusa 3 tool I got an error. Tried re applying SN, \"Fsys Block not found\". Clean ME region - failed. (board still worked at this point). \nReplaced BIOS form same board. Fan still spun. \nUsed Medusa to clean ME region while out of mac by shorting R5116. This was successful but now the board is dead. Magsafe green>orange. \nReplaced ROM again with no change.. \n\nWhat did I do?"}
