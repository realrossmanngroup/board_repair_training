SMC_TPAD_RST_L is a signal that comes from the trackpad that can reset the SMC when it is low.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. The trackpad having corrosion from liquid damage is a very common cause of no light on the magsafe charger & the system not turning on, when the trackpad or trackpad cable is corroded and holding this line down. .",

            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00164</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>  (SMC Reset \"Button\", Supervisor & AVREF Supply) rabbit hole from hell.\n\nThis post will show you just how little I know on these boards.  \n\nI have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00164</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> will not get \"Green Light\"\nH20 damage around the SMC area.   I cleaned it, picked at it and reflowed any resistor that looks suspicious.   Even took them off to make sure.  I checked all their resistances and voltages and compared to a working board.  Still no green light. So I am jumping to SMC right...  Must be crud under it.    I did everything possible to not mess with that chip!   They eat time.  So I took it off and it was perfect.  No corrosion nothing.  Everything was clean.  Lucky for me I took it off I dragged it across a row of balls so I get to reball now.  \n\nSMC is done.  looking around and measuring I notice that the <SIGNAL>SM_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is staying low.  I am thinking why didn't I drop to brain mode sooner.   After a few minutes of looking I get tangled around this (circuit SMC Reset \"Button\", Supervisor & AVREF Supply) and think it has to be something in the area.  This is the only area that needed slight rework when I first started in on this board.   There was a pad eaten away on <RESISTOR>R5000</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C5020</CAPACITOR>.  The power inputs of course.  where else would water damage be.. I notice that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC</SIGNAL> is 0.0V  I check chip power, The <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_SMC</SIGNAL> & <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_SMCVREF</SIGNAL> are both present.  Missing is the <SIGNAL>SMC_TPAD_RST_L</SIGNAL> & <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> both reading low.   I decided to change the chip.  U 5110 was repealed and replaced. I noticed that with the chip off the unit would green light and do a S0 bounce!  I dropped on the replacement <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> sure I had it figured out and I am the man only to discover same problem.    I was looking down a rabbit hole. \n\nPlease put me on the path of righteousness and help me find my way.   I am in a rabbit hole and stuck."
