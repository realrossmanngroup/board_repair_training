Seeing as the ISL does give ACOK and there is no green light there is an issue around the SMC. Check all power to the SMC and check Xtal for clock pulse. Also verify that the reset is working correctly. You can manually short reset to GND after power is applied to make sure the SMC makes a \"clean start\""}
