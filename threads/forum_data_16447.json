    "definitions": {
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS? This power rail is PPBUS_G3H after going through a current sense resistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H & the input of PPBUS_G3H to circuitry that provides power for the CPU..",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL? This is the voltage coming directly from the charger after going through a transistor. .",
        "PP1V05_SUS": "What is PP1V05_SUS? The PP1V05_SUS signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that supplies 1.05 volts, typically used in a suspended (SUS) state of the laptop. This state is a low-power mode where essential system functions are maintained, but the majority of the system is powered down..",
        "PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS? This is PPBUS_G3H after passing through a current sense resistor that splits it off from the rest of PPBUS_G3H. The purpose of this is so that we can measure how much current is flowing to this part of the machine..",
        "R6121": "What is R6121? a RESISTOR.",
        "R6128": "What is R6128? a RESISTOR.",
        "R6127": "What is R6127? a RESISTOR.",
        "C1031": "What is C1031? a CAPACITOR.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running.."
