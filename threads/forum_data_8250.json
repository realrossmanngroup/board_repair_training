STILL DIDN'T GET CLOSE TO 0,\ndamn , then i was trying to get the schematics of MAX15119 and see the internal design and see why it's giving out 600 sth instead of 0. not available online.\ni think once the chip is on , that pin should be pulled down. so I just jump a wire from GND to pin1 , pulled down that pin1 . damn then it worked!! now doing ASD on it\n\n(I'm talking about pin1 and pin 2 of r7441,not the MAX IC)"}
