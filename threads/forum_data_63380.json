        "LCD_PWR_EN": "What is LCD_PWR_EN? LCD_PWR_EN is a signal that tells the chip that supplies power to the LCD screen to turn on..",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

            "message": "Good evening,\n\nI have a MBP 2012 with <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B logic board without Backlight but with image; if I apply some light from the back of the lid, I can distinguish a \"question mark folder\".\n\nThe LVDS J9000 connector had obviously been damaged; pins 38, 39 and 40 burnt.\nConnector now removed. 0V on pads 38/39/40\nThen, 0V on both side of L9701\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_SW_BKL</SIGNAL> is at 0V but F9700 is not burnt: 12.68V on both side of the fuse\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> is weird ;it's a P-Type Mosfet, but I have 0.1V on pins 5 and pins 6. Regarding pin 2, it starts at 7V (when I start measuring it with the multimeter), but it relatively quickly drops to 4->3.2->2.5->2->1.6->1.2->0.9->0.7->0.6V->....\nReferring to the specifications, pin 3 is the gate and pin 4 the source. If V-Gate <RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR>-><TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> acts like a voltage divider if <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> fully opened, which seems to be the case here.\nWhatever <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>BKLT_PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL> are, the source being 0, it will always be opened, unless something burns in this circuitry (am I wrong there ?)\n\n\n\nRegarding  J9000, I do have 3.3V on pins 4 and 6; and I measure 0.01V on pins 1, 2, 3, is it because the LCD is not plugged in ?\n\nOn <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>, I do have 3.3V on pins 2 and 3. However, pin 0 shows 0.011V\nI measured the same value on pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R9678</RESISTOR>, pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R9094</RESISTOR> and TP[1]<SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>\nI measured voltage on pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R9678</RESISTOR>, there is 2.69V. The resistance itself is at 4.4kOhm. So far it looks normal.\n\nHoweverm <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> should give something on \"pin 112\" for <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> (\"PB19B\" on the schematics\"). I wonder if the missing <SIGNAL>PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR</SIGNAL> (0.1V instead of12.68) is the cause.\nAlso, <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> is at 0V, which is an input for <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR>\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_GMUX_ULC_VCCPLL</SIGNAL> is at 3.37V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_GMUX_LRC_VCCPLL</SIGNAL> is at 3.37V\nBut it's probaby useless to investigate in this direction.\n\nShall I remove <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> ?\n\nKR to the readers :)\n\nS."
