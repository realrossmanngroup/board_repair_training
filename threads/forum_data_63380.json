Regarding pin 2, it starts at 7V (when I start measuring it with the multimeter), but it relatively quickly drops to 4->3.2->2.5->2->1.6->1.2->0.9->0.7->0.6V->....\nReferring to the specifications, pin 3 is the gate and pin 4 the source. If V-Gate R9789->Q9707 acts like a voltage divider if Q9707 fully opened, which seems to be the case here.\nWhatever LCD_BKLT_EN and BKLT_PLT_RST_L are, the source being 0, it will always be opened, unless something burns in this circuitry (am I wrong there ?)\n\n\n\nRegarding  J9000, I do have 3.3V on pins 4 and 6; and I measure 0.01V on pins 1, 2, 3, is it because the LCD is not plugged in ?\n\nOn U9000, I do have 3.3V on pins 2 and 3. However, pin 0 shows 0.011V\nI measured the same value on pin 1 of R9678, pin 1 of R9094 and TP[1]LCD_PWR_EN\nI measured voltage on pin 2 of R9678, there is 2.69V. The resistance itself is at 4.4kOhm. So far it looks normal.\n\nHoweverm U9600 should give something on \"pin 112\" for LCD_PWR_EN (\"PB19B\" on the schematics\"). I wonder if the missing PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR (0.1V instead of12.68) is the cause.\nAlso, LCD_BKLT_EN is at 0V, which is an input for Q9707\n\nPP3V3_S0_GMUX_ULC_VCCPLL is at 3.37V\nPP3V3_S0_GMUX_LRC_VCCPLL is at 3.37V\nBut it's probaby useless to investigate in this direction.\n\nShall I remove Q9706 ?\n\nKR to the readers :)\n\nS."}
