        "message":"When I got this MBPr 13 in it could not charge. It had been lying vertically in a bag together with a rotten banana (or another fruit). Damage was heavily corrosion inside both thunderbolt ports. As there was no green\/orange light and it could not charge I cleaned the banana off lightly with a toothbrush and replaced the DC-in board. Now orange light came up and computer ran fine and was charging but it started to smell like fried bananas all over my workshop. So I cleaned it in ultrasonic but after this it is dead.\n\nI got:\n- Burned thunderbolt ports (both of them)\n- PPBUS_G3H 12.28V\n- SMC_ADAPTER_EN 0.2V\n- No S5 (3V and 5V)\n- SMC_BC_ACOK 3.11V\n- No green\/orange light (obviously)\n- CHGR_DCIN 16.48V\n- CHGR_ACIN 3.96V\n\nDid I fry the SMC while burning the banana? It was on for a couple of of minutes before I noticed the smell and then I shut it down normally."
