    "definitions": {
        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running.."

            "message": "When I got this MBPr 13 in it could not charge. It had been lying vertically in a bag together with a rotten banana (or another fruit). Damage was heavily corrosion inside both thunderbolt ports. As there was no green/orange light and it could not charge I cleaned the banana off lightly with a toothbrush and replaced the DC-in board. Now orange light came up and computer ran fine and was charging but it started to smell like fried bananas all over my workshop. So I cleaned it in ultrasonic but after this it is dead.\n\nI got:\n- Burned thunderbolt ports (both of them)\n- <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.28V\n- <SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER_EN</SIGNAL> 0.2V\n- No S5 (3V and 5V)\n- <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> 3.11V\n- No green/orange light (obviously)\n- <SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> 16.48V\n- <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> 3.96V\n\nDid I fry the SMC while burning the banana? It was on for a couple of of minutes before I noticed the smell and then I shut it down normally."
