I have a problem with another 820-3115-B. It runs perfectly fine - it only has no backlight. I followed this path to LCD_BKLT_EN which is 0V. This is renamed to LVDS_IG_BKL_ON which comes from the PCH. I assume that because everything else works on this machine the PCH is working fine. At this point i don\u00b4t know what to do or maybe i missed something.\nThank you for your help.\nRegards,\nFelix"}

If i ground Pin 3 to pin 1 of Q9707 nothing happens. Also if i ground pin 3 of Q9707 to an actual screw hole nothing happens. I measured the resistance (pin 3 to ground with jumper in place) to verify i shorted it right and it was 0,002V in diode mode. With the jumper (pin 1-pin 3) is removed i get on Q9707 pin 1,4,5,6 =0V, Pin 2=3,324V and pin 3=11,92V. On Q9706 i get: Pin 3=12.10V, Pin 4=12.6V and pin 1,2,5,6 are something between 4,3 - 5V and slowly rising (don\u00b4t know where it stops). With the jumper back in place i get on pin 1,2,5,6 straight 12.58V as it should be (with an LCD connected still 12.58V and no backlight) So i assume everything here is fine except for LCD_BKLT_EN.\nI followed the 12.58V to D9701 where it should be much higher but it still measures on both sides of D9701 12.6V. On U9701 BKL_EN is 3,111V, PP5V_S0_BKL is 5V, PP3V3_S0_BKL_VDDIO is 3,3V and PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB is 12.58V which is all fine i think. Means this that U9701 is also dead?"}

I normally measure it with an LCD connected but as i need to flip the board around i disconnected it this time if i mention right:(. Now i get all signals right at Q9707 and Q9706 but still 12.6V on both pins of D9701. I measured with 2 different LCD\u00b4s while i was getting sure a picture. On U9701 BKL_EN is 3,112V, PP5V_S0_BKL is 5,07V, PP3V3_S0_BKL_VDDIO is 3,311V and PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB is 12.58V. I\u00b4m not sure but is this caused by a dead U9701 that\u00b4s not boosting?"}
