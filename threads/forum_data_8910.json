    "definitions": {
        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "LVDS_IG_BKL_ON": "What is LVDS_IG_BKL_ON? LVDS_IG_BKL_ON is equivalent to LCD_BKLT_EN. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "C9782": "What is C9782? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q9707": "What is Q9707? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "U9701": "What is U9701? a CHIP.",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB": "What is PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S0_BKL_VDDIO": "What is PP3V3_S0_BKL_VDDIO? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP5V_S0_BKL": "What is PP5V_S0_BKL? a SIGNAL.",
        "R2055": "What is R2055? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly.."

It runs perfectly fine - it only has no backlight. I followed this path to <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> which is 0V. This is renamed to <SIGNAL>LVDS_IG_BKL_ON</SIGNAL> which comes from the PCH. I assume that because everything else works on this machine the PCH is working fine. At this point i don´t know what to do or maybe i missed something.\nThank you for your help.\nRegards,\nFelix"

If i ground Pin 3 to pin 1 of <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> nothing happens. Also if i ground pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> to an actual screw hole nothing happens. I measured the resistance (pin 3 to ground with jumper in place) to verify i shorted it right and it was 0,002V in diode mode. With the jumper (pin 1-pin 3) is removed i get on <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> pin 1,4,5,6 =0V, Pin 2=3,324V and pin 3=11,92V. On <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> i get: Pin 3=12.10V, Pin 4=12.6V and pin 1,2,5,6 are something between 4,3 - 5V and slowly rising (don´t know where it stops). With the jumper back in place i get on pin 1,2,5,6 straight 12.58V as it should be (with an LCD connected still 12.58V and no backlight) So i assume everything here is fine except for <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL>.\nI followed the 12.58V to <DIODE>D9701</DIODE> where it should be much higher but it still measures on both sides of <DIODE>D9701</DIODE> 12.6V. On <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> is 3,111V, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_BKL</SIGNAL> is 5V, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_BKL_VDDIO</SIGNAL> is 3,3V and <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB</SIGNAL> is 12.58V which is all fine i think.
