        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "U7700": "What is U7700? a CHIP.",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

        "U8330": "What is U8330? a CHIP.",
        "EDP_PANEL_PWR": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "Q7700": "What is Q7700? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "R7750": "What is R7750? a RESISTOR.",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created..",
        "BKLT_SDA": "What is BKLT_SDA? BKLT_SDA is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",

I checked where it gets the signal from and it looks like it's an OR gate, and needs either: <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> or <SIGNAL>LCD_PSR_EN</SIGNAL> to generate the enable. Both are missing. Both signals come from the SMC (I think). Anything I can do?"
