        "message":"Hi, I have an A1706 that has been given a little drink at the side of the keyboard right where the SSD chip is.\n\nTurns on but doesn?t see the SSD\n\nI took the board out and cleaned the small amount of crap near the SSD.\n\nPut the board back in and checked it.\nNow it sees the SSD, boots and runs perfectly... until you take the charger out.\nWith the charger is in, it sees the SSD, if it?s running on the battery only, it doesn?t see it.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nI?m not with the Mac right now and haven?t got a schematic, so I haven?t got voltages just yet.\njust wondered if anyone had seen this type of fault before as it seems very likely given the position of the SSD.\n\nIm assuming there?s separate power feeds to the SSD depending on charger or battery."
