Client has liquid damage.  She said was WAS turning on so she took to Apple for a checkup, they told her to replace entire unit and now the unit does not turn on at all.  I have examined the board, there was a lot of water in the macbook but the board seems OK visually.  On the touchpad there was a little corrosion which could be the cause of the issues (assuming the On button runs through the KB as in the past.\n\nObviously without a board number I can't get a schematic or provide any useful info to you!\n\nWhere might I find a board number?"}
