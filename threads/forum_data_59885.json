Can I put it in an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> in order to test it ?\n\nAnd then, for the sake of completeness, same question but the other way around: will an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2159</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> accept a display that comes from an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> ?"

So nobody will \"not accept it\" in this case (besides myself) ;)\nYeah, I was also thinking about that True tone thing, which is why I asked the question both ways. I think there's a good chance that an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2159</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> display would work in an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, but the other way around can be more of a challenge.\nBut yeah, I was basically trying to see if some people already tried those swaps and if they were successful or not. I assume, based on your response, that you have never tried this yourself ?"

I'll try again, targeting specifically duke's posts.\nAnd if nothing, I'll cross check one more time the connector pinout to check that signals are indeed compatible, and if so, I'll just give it a try. If the screen works then I know I have a good screen. If it doesn't, then I don't know if that's a bad screen, or just that it's not compatible, or both."

But basically duke was saying that the display from a non-true tone machine would work in a machine that has true tone, but with brightness issues. He didn't say if a true tone display would work in a non true tone machine though.\nSo there's only one way for me to find out now. I'll report back later on with my results."
