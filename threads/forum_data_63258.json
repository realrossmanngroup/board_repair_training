Besides, this forum is great as it is, and given its purpose it makes sense. I did read the terms of use, etc, I am not complaining of anything.

            "message": "Thanks; I will come back on this part of the issue asap, give it a xth thought, and answer the questions.\n\nHowever, I must apologize because I was working on 2 similar boards and while I checked the presence of <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> on the second one, I forgot to do it on this one...\n\nI suddenly realized that I have [B]no <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>[/B] on this one neither => I did new measurements on [B]<CHIP>U7501</CHIP> [/B]to check whether I had _S5.\n\nOn the schematics page 58, there is a \"[B]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_LDO</SIGNAL>[/B]\" which is not named like this on the boardview, and must be at 5V, as VOUT. Problem is, I measured on pin 14, I have 0.31V. So, for some reason, this <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> is NOT ouputing 5V.\n\nMeasurements on <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>:\n\npin 14, pin 29, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_LDO</SIGNAL>: [COLOR=rgb(226, 80, 65)]0.31V => Problem[/COLOR]\n\npin 21, <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> : 3.33V\npin 20, <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_PGOOD</SIGNAL>: 3.34V\n-> the chip receives <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> and send <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_PGOOD</SIGNAL> [COLOR=rgb(26, 188, 156)]=>OK[/COLOR]\n\npin 12, <SIGNAL>P5VS5_EN</SIGNAL>: 3.38V same as <SIGNAL>S5_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> same as <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> (page 64 \"S5 Enable\") [COLOR=rgb(26, 188, 156)]=>OK[/COLOR]\n\npin 4: <SIGNAL>P5VS3_EN</SIGNAL> : [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]0V[/COLOR]; but if _S5 not present on pin 14, not surprising.\npin 5: <SIGNAL>P5VS3_PGOOD</SIGNAL>: [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]0V[/COLOR]; again, if _S5 not present on pin 14, not surprising.\nI wont check the other P5VS3 pins, no reason to have anything different from 0V.\n\npin 15: <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_COMP2</SIGNAL> : 0V\npin 16: <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_VFB2</SIGNAL> : 0.165V\npin 3: <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_RF</SIGNAL> : 0V\npin 17: <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_CSN2</SIGNAL>: 0.55V\npin 18: <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_CSP2</SIGNAL>: 0.55V\npin 24: <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_DRVH</SIGNAL>: 0.54V\npin 25: <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_LL</SIGNAL>: 0.54V\npin 26: <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_VBST</SIGNAL>: 0.41V\npin 27: <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_DRVL</SIGNAL>: 0V\n\nSo, in short:\n[COLOR=rgb(41, 105, 176)]<CHIP>U7501</CHIP> is told that P5VS5 is enabled on pin12.  It is also told that <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> is enabled on pin 21. The chip returns <SIGNAL>P3V3_S5_PGOOD</SIGNAL> on pin 20. \nHowever, it doesnot ouput the <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_LDO</SIGNAL> correctly (0.31V on pin14 and 29). Since this _S5 is not what it should, the chip cannot receive the <SIGNAL>P5VS3_EN</SIGNAL> because the P5VS3 is actually not enabled correctly, and therefore the chip returns 0V on pin 5 for <SIGNAL>P5VS3_PGOOD</SIGNAL>.[/COLOR]\n\nI tried to find the datasheet of <CHIP>TPS51980</CHIP> to learn more about it, didnt find it.\n\nIs it possible that the short around the <TRANSISTOR>Q7310</TRANSISTOR>/20 might have killed the <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> ?\n\nIn that case I better find and fix the short first, then very likely replace <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>, then replace the fuse.\n\n\n\"Feel free to send a PM, if you require another information, regardless online assistance.\"\nThanks for this 🙏"
