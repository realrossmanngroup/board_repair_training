        "message":"Good evening,\n\nI have a 820-4924-A logic board with amber and green light on the charger. The board is currently out of the MacBook,and not connected to anything besides the charger.\n\nI measured PPBUS_G3H on the fuse F7140.  \nPin1: 12.68V\nPin2: 0V\n\nI unplugged the board, tested the fuse with diode mode; probes on pin 2 and ground => Beep. I also measured 0.1 Ohms.\nProblem seems similar to what was described there : [URL]https:\/\/boards.rossmanngroup.com\/threads\/820-4924-a-ppsub_g3h-shorted-ground.7292\/[\/URL]\n\ndukefawks and aprendiz asked the resistance to ground from  F7140 to L7320. Original author didnt reply. \nOn my board, I have 0.5ohms on pin 2 of L7320, but it decreases to 0.0 in 5-6 sec.\nI have 0 ohm on pin 1 of L7320\n\nThere is no sign of corrosion, no sign of liquid, board has not been cleaned; there is still dust a bit everywhere, but almost nothing.\n\nNothing get hot.\n\nHow do I narrow down the cause of the problem ? And if there was no liquid, then what might have caused a short?\n\nP.S: Was I supposed to post under the old thread, 6y old, or create a new one ?"

He tried to turn it on again, but this time the crash occured during the boot, just after the apple logo.

Besides, this forum is great as it is, and given its purpose it makes sense. I did read the terms of use, etc, I am not complaining of anything.

Problem is, I measured on pin 14, I have 0.31V. So, for some reason, this U7501 is NOT ouputing 5V.\n\nMeasurements on U7501:\n\npin 14, pin 29, PP5V_S5_LDO: [COLOR=rgb(226, 80, 65)]0.31V => Problem[\/COLOR]\n\npin 21, P3V3S5_EN : 3.33V\npin 20, P3V3S5_PGOOD: 3.34V\n-> the chip receives P3V3S5_EN and send P3V3S5_PGOOD [COLOR=rgb(26, 188, 156)]=>OK[\/COLOR]\n\npin 12, P5VS5_EN: 3.38V same as S5_PWR_EN same as P3V3S5_EN (page 64 \"S5 Enable\") [COLOR=rgb(26, 188, 156)]=>OK[\/COLOR]\n\npin 4: P5VS3_EN : [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]0V[\/COLOR]; but if _S5 not present on pin 14, not surprising.\npin 5: P5VS3_PGOOD: [COLOR=rgb(251, 160, 38)]0V[\/COLOR]; again, if _S5 not present on pin 14, not surprising.\nI wont check the other P5VS3 pins, no reason to have anything different from 0V.\n\npin 15: P3V3S5_COMP2 : 0V\npin 16: P3V3S5_VFB2 : 0.165V\npin 3: P3V3S5_RF : 0V\npin 17: P3V3S5_CSN2: 0.55V\npin 18: P3V3S5_CSP2: 0.55V\npin 24: P3V3S5_DRVH: 0.54V\npin 25: P3V3S5_LL: 0.54V\npin 26: P3V3S5_VBST: 0.41V\npin 27: P3V3S5_DRVL: 0V\n\nSo, in short:\n[COLOR=rgb(41, 105, 176)]U7501 is told that P5VS5 is enabled on pin12.  It is also told that P3V3S5_EN is enabled on pin 21. The chip returns P3V3_S5_PGOOD on pin 20. \nHowever, it doesnot ouput the PP5V_S5_LDO correctly (0.31V on pin14 and 29). Since this _S5 is not what it should, the chip cannot receive the P5VS3_EN because the P5VS3 is actually not enabled correctly, and therefore the chip returns 0V on pin 5 for P5VS3_PGOOD.[\/COLOR]\n\nI tried to find the datasheet of TPS51980 to learn more about it, didnt find it.\n\nIs it possible that the short around the Q7310\/20 might have killed the U7501 ?\n\nIn that case I better find and fix the short first, then very likely replace U7501, then replace the fuse.\n\n\n\"Feel free to send a PM, if you require another information, regardless online assistance.\"\nThanks for this \ud83d\ude4f"

So. I assume it is normal that I do not have an infinite resistance between above pin 5 and pin2 of F7140. I'm stuck with that loo.\n\nI guess I have to break the circuit at some other part to find where is the short causing the resistance between pin2 of F7140 and pin5 of Q7320 (removed) to be 0. But I can't figure out where. Remove U7200?\n\nGoing to replace Q7320\/Q7321 now"

        "message":"Regarding my last post; the battery was dead, i replaced it, the macbook was able to boot properly then. The death of Q7320, Q7321 probably caused to battery, or the battery caused the problem. Anyway, this part is sorted.\nRegarding the image size on screen after boot, it was caused by the settings; everything was scaled down to display more info on screen.\nEverything fixed so, thanks for your help 2informaticos\n\nRegarding  \"direct connection point between PPBUS_G3H and PPVIN_S0_CPUVR\": Indeed. p68 shows that from PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS we get PPVIN_S0_CPUVR, and PPBUS_G3H gives PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS_R, which on page 42 sends back PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS (U5400) if it has  PP3V3_S0_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS"
