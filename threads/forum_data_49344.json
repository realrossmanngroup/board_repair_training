Left fan only comes on when i leave the trackpad unplugged, so suspect there may also be issues with the trackpad.\n\nNo liquid damage, but the laptop was dropped, which is when the issue started. Not sure where to start here as the usual power rails are all present. \n\nThe <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> laptops should bootup even when the keyboard is discounted, right?"
