        "message":"The customer said this stopped working one day and they took it to a shop so I'm not sure if they cleaned it. I don't see any corrosion anywhere but I do see some discolored probe points. \nI measured F7041 in diode mode and PPBUS_G3H was measuring 0v to ground. I removed L7030 and found that Pin 2 was the side that was shorted.\n\nI hooked my power supply to inject voltage onto Pin 2 and when I get to around 0.5v it starts pulling the maximum 5 amps. I checked all the ppbus_g3h areas on the boardview but I don't feel anything getting very hot.\n\nIs there any common areas I should look for or do I just need to check more carefully?"
