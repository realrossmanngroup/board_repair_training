    "definitions": {
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PM_S0_PGOOD": "What is PM_S0_PGOOD?  PM_S0_PGOOD is created when CPUVR_PGOOD and ALL_SYS_PWRGD are present and branches off to become PM_PCH_PWROK. PM_S0_PGOOD and SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD are necessary to create SYS_PWROK_R and PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK .",
        "C1910": "What is C1910? a CAPACITOR.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on.."
