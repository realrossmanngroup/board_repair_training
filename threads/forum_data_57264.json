I noticed that U1950 and C1950 were corroded as well as R5177 and R5178. Well I replaced U1950 and C1950 and the board got a chime and fan spin. So I thought I would replace R5177 and R5178 because the ends were dark gray. SO I replaced those, touched up a couple joints on R8151 and a couple others. I put the logic board back into the case and now I am back to a non working board drawing 108mA. Not sure what I did but I am missing P5VS4RS3_PGOOD. I am not sure what I did wrong but this is baffling. All I did was touch up some solder joints and clean the areas with IPA and a brush. I do not see anywhere where I might have knocked off a component and I wasn't brushing very hard."}

I measured the resistance and the end cap fell off. Replaced and now have a running board. Silly..."}
