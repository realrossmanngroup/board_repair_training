I noticed that <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C1950</CAPACITOR> were corroded as well as <RESISTOR>R5177</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5178</RESISTOR>. Well I replaced <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C1950</CAPACITOR> and the board got a chime and fan spin. So I thought I would replace <RESISTOR>R5177</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5178</RESISTOR> because the ends were dark gray. SO I replaced those, touched up a couple joints on <RESISTOR>R8151</RESISTOR> and a couple others. I put the logic board back into the case and now I am back to a non working board drawing 108mA. Not sure what I did but I am missing <SIGNAL>P5VS4RS3_PGOOD</SIGNAL>. I am not sure what I did wrong but this is baffling. All I did was touch up some solder joints and clean the areas with IPA and a brush. I do not see anywhere where I might have knocked off a component and I wasn't brushing very hard."
