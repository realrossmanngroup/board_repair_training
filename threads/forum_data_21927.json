    "definitions": {
        "820-00138": "What is 820-00138? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC? SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC is a voltage that is created if SMC_BC_ACOK & PP3V42_G3H are both present that powers the chipset for the onewire circuit that allows the SMC to talk to the charger on the SYS_ONEWIRE line. This is necessary for the magsafe charger to have a light on it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",
        "R5100": "What is R5100? a RESISTOR."

No green light on adapter. \nCleaned up and replaced <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and surrounding components.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12.26v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> -  3.409v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC</SIGNAL> - 3.409v\n<SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> - 3.387v\n\nMade sure I am using original 85w Magsafe 2 however I only get 16.73v on f7005 both sides. shouldnt it be 20v ? I am also testing with a known good magsafe board. \n\n<CHIP>U7100</CHIP> - Pin 17/18 - 2.9 Ohm\n<CHIP>U7100</CHIP> - Pin 27/28 - 20.9 Ohm\n\nThanks."
