Resistance reading of about 2ohms. Resistance reading of just pins 1,2,3 to ground is 12ohms, which matches a good board. Replaced both Q7310 after confirm short was gone on pin4 pad's. Once power is applied, both transistors blow out again. \n\nEverything else appears to be measure good, except this two transistors. One thing to note, the transistor package label didn't match the new ones i installed which are both \nSISA12DN (new from mouser).\n\nAny suggestions?"}
