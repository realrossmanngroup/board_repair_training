PPBUS_G3H, PP3V42_G3H, PPVRTC_G3H are all present and correct. Testing PP5V_S5 and PP3V3_S5 I noticed their voltages were pulsating.\n\nI replaced U7100 but it made no difference it is still doing the same thing. Are there any other components that can cause this issue?\n\nThanks"}

It had a short on 3V3_S4 caused by C2950. I replaced it and it is working fine now. Thanks for your help."}
