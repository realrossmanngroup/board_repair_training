Have rebuilt some backlight circuits and repaired the common iPhone errors so that's something.\n\nThe board Im working on now 820 4924 stopped working because of liquid damage and didn't turn on but with a light on the charger. Got the board out and it took around 36mA. Got the first few G3H lines as normal so went ahead to clean up the dirty corroded areas:\n<CHIP>U3740</CHIP>\n<TRANSISTOR>Q5480</TRANSISTOR>\n<TRANSISTOR>Q1840</TRANSISTOR>\n<TRANSISTOR>Q1842</TRANSISTOR>\n\nI first was confused by the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> being 12.5V for a macbook since I worked more on MBA's. Expected it to be 8.6V so looked around the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> and replaced it with a donor. PPBUS stayed the same and found out that the voltage is normal for the MBP's. Now it's starting around 44mA and working to 49-51mA after a few seconds. This after replacing the ISL and cleaning up. These are a few rails to get an idea:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.5\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING</SIGNAL> = 12.5\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.42\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER5V</SIGNAL> = 12.5\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER3V3</SIGNAL> = 12.5\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.32\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> = 3.32\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 5.0\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> = 3.32\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> = 3.32\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> = 0\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S4_X239</SIGNAL> = 0\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0_CPUVR</SIGNAL> = 12.53\n\nLooking around the web I expected that an <SIGNAL>S4_EN</SIGNAL> signal is maybe missing since I couldn't find any shorts on the S4 rails which might cause all S4 rails to be pulled to ground. Trailing back some <SIGNAL>S4_EN</SIGNAL> signals gets me to big BGA chips. When it is not reaching an S4 state, what would be some of the first useful enable signals to check? Or is there something that Im overlooking right now?\n\nThanks in advance!"

Meanwhile I was wondering if there are some videos on how to erase the current SPI ROM and how to write a full new BIOS to the chip. The manufacturer does not have many videos on that. Do you have any? I cannot seem to find any BIOS flashing videos of louis :(. Would like not to do it as trial and error since I heard plenty of horror stories about bricking a motherboard by installing the wrong BIOS or the right BIOS the wrong way."
