        "message":"Hello everybody !\n\nThe charger is stuck at 5V - 0amps.\n\nPP3V3_G3H gets dragged down to 2.26v for an unknow reason. If I remove the resistor R6999, pin 1 gives me 3.4v. Resistance in diode mode (red probe on ground) on pin 2 is 0.395 and another way (black probe on ground) is 0.822\n\nI've tried voltage injection, but it's not drawing any current. \n\nAny idea ,what's going on?"
