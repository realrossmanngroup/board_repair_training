They said it came from another repair facility stating they replaced several components and claimed it was a GPU issue.

So here?s what I?ve replaced on it so far: <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>, the edP MUX, the big GMUX, the LCD connector, all of the filters on the backside by the DC-in connector. Original problem was no external nor internal video. Resoldered <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> got 5 volts to the LCD (had zero before). Had short on BKLT found short near the transistors. Got BKLT but no image (weird) and restored external (or so I thought). Replaced <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>, the LCD connector and the filters first to rule that out. Same thing. Replaced both MUXs same thing so said fuck it. If you notice, you get BKLT as soon as the fan spins then the screen flashes and it chimes. I suspect either bad GPU, bad VRAM or an internal crack in the board somewhere. If you can replace the GPU itself, give it a try. After that and VRAM, I would say junk at that point. You should def tell that store NOT to send you junk tho lol"
