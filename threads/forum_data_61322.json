        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

            "message": "Hello, we have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00244</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that came in for battery replacement. After the battery was replaced, we have a black display. We have tried a known working display and same situation. Display completely black, so its not no backlight. I checked, we have 5V (<CAPACITOR>C8512</CAPACITOR>)  for a second and then drops to 0v, and 0.144v on Backlight IC (<CAPACITOR>C8500</CAPACITOR>). Pin 23 from LCD connector 0v. Any idea what can cause this. I connect to external display and that works. Also noticed KBD not working (worked before). Could it be related to i.e. a damaged keyboard flex cable? Will try another cable tomorrow as first I am backing up the data from this pile of trash."
