        "A1465": "What is A1465? A1465 is a model number for a 11 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2924, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00164, 820-3208, 820-3435..",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "U6990": "What is U6990? a CHIP.",
        "820-3208": "What is 820-3208? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "R6995": "What is R6995? a RESISTOR.",
        "R6996": "What is R6996? a RESISTOR.",
        "R6905": "What is R6905? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on older Macbooks, pre-2011 models. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on.."
