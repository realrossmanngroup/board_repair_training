        "message":"Hi, got an 820-3437-B with corrosion on C7115, C7116 and R7116. Replaced them and also replaced U7100 just in case. \n\nTrace from C7115 to R7116 was blown and soldered jumper. Both C7116 were also blown, soldered one side to probe point near R7116 and another jumper across the board to pin 1 of Q7155. Continuity from all pins of U7100 seems to be ok, however, board is destroyed under under  C7116 from the corrosion. \n\nNow the board shows green light and then orange. No fan spin. \n\nPPBUS_G3H is 1.3v, no signs of heat generation. Diode mode on  PPBUS_G3H is 0.116"
