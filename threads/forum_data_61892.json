Replaced them and also replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> just in case. \n\nTrace from <CAPACITOR>C7115</CAPACITOR> to <RESISTOR>R7116</RESISTOR> was blown and soldered jumper. Both <CAPACITOR>C7116</CAPACITOR> were also blown, soldered one side to probe point near <RESISTOR>R7116</RESISTOR> and another jumper across the board to pin 1 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR>. Continuity from all pins of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> seems to be ok, however, board is destroyed under under  <CAPACITOR>C7116</CAPACITOR> from the corrosion. \n\nNow the board shows green light and then orange. No fan spin. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 1.3v, no signs of heat generation. Diode mode on  <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 0.116"
