If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

If I keep the meter probe on L7220 nothing happens again until I remove the probe.\n\nHistory? None that I have been told. It has unfortunately been worked on before and ultrsonic cleaned before I got it. Frankly, I would rather have it withy all the crap still on as that always gives clues at lest.\n\nIt is effectively trying to start, sensing something wrong and shutting straight off, then sensing it is all fine and looping.\n\nI am going to check <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR> again tomorrow. I am unwell and can only do som much in a day. From memory, Pin 2 had 4.94v and pin 1 had nothing, but if you check at the right moment you get a spike of 3v or so and if you keep the meter on there it does nothing until released. Same with pin 1 of <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> as it turns out. My guess is that <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR> is OK.\n\nNever come across this before. Had plenty that sort of work, don't work, dead etc. But this is irritating although rewardig if solved I am sure."
