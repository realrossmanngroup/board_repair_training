            "message": "I got a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01598</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that was liquid damaged around the trackpad connector and did not turn on. Trackpad connector was burned on <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S4_TPAD_FUSE</SIGNAL>. I cleaned the area and replaced the trackpad connector with a new one. All diode mode readings on the trackpad connector seemed to match a good board now, so I plugged the board in using another known good trackpad and it boots to the OS, but keyboard and trackpad do not work. I rechecked all diode mode values on the trackpad and keyboard connector and made sure there were no broken traces there. With the trackpad connected, I was not getting any voltage on <SIGNAL>TPAD_SPI_EN</SIGNAL>, which comes from the T2 chip. I removed <CHIP>U6855</CHIP> and found I have OL on pin 1, which is not normal. Seems the trace between the T2 chip and pin 1 of <CHIP>U6855</CHIP> is broken. I cannot run a wire without removing the T2 chip, which I do not want to do. Wondering if I can connect Pin 1 of <CHIP>U6855</CHIP> to <SIGNAL>TPAD_3V3_SPI_INT_L</SIGNAL>, or some similar signal to make it work? Any ideas?"
