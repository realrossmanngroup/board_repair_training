I inspected if any corrosion around that chip ( <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> CHIPS), and I didn't see any corrosion around it.\nBut I found a spot blocking the signal around the chip <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> pin 41. The path was broken ( corroded ) as you can see in the pictures. \nI am just delighted because I just recovered that path and the MacBook is working perfectly. \nThank you so much for the tip! \n\nBDW, next time I will use rail name, not component. I didn't know that. I'm studying it yet. \n\nSo, for example, <SIGNAL>P5VS4_EN</SIGNAL> Shouln't measure with a multimeter, but oscilloscope right. \n\nYes, both ports had the same behavior. \n\nRegards \nManuel"
