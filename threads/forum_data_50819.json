            "message": "Hey!\n\nSo this is pretty much my fault for being lazy, but here it goes.\n\nCustomer came in with 2016 13\" Macbook Pro with screen going in and out as it gets extended. i immediately think its the shitty cable flex thing with Apple and order a new assembly.\n\nCome to find out there is a little liquid on the fans and some by the right USBC input, if your looking at it with lcd connector closest. \n\nSo the issue is that the computer now still turns on with both assemblies and cpu gets hot, fans spin when they are supposed to and usb light is on external sata cable.\n\nSo I guess it turns on but i get no video or touch bar like i used to . \n\nOh , and I never work on these so I'm kinda screeeewed!\n\n\nThanks and sorry :( lol"

Didn't see any liquid over by j4402 but when this thing is on j4402 feels like it's on fire.\n\nLight on USB drive is steady, no blinking/reading. fans kick on here and there.\n\nThanks guys for all the replies. Like I said I have never worked an these and donors seem to be pretty pricey so I have no clue where to start and most likely will not be\n\nrepairing if its a goner."
