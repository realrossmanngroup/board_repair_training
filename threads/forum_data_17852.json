        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

        "PP1V8_S3": "What is PP1V8_S3? The PP1V8_S3 signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides a voltage of 1.8 volts during the S3 power state. The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",
        "PP1V05_SUS": "What is PP1V05_SUS? The PP1V05_SUS signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that supplies 1.05 volts, typically used in a suspended (SUS) state of the laptop. This state is a low-power mode where essential system functions are maintained, but the majority of the system is powered down..",
        "PP3V3_S4SW_SNS": "What is PP3V3_S4SW_SNS? a SIGNAL.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
