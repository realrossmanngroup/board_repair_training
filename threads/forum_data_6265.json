I tested the voltages around <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> and everything looks good. No <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_PGOOD</SIGNAL> but I'm not sure what triggers that to come on. <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_TONA</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_TONB</SIGNAL> resistors are good. Voltage is traveling through them properly - voltage measures fine at pins 1 and 48 on <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>. <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_VR_ON</SIGNAL> is good. The 5V line is everywhere it needs to be. No output (0.005V) at PHASE! and UGATE1. Any ideas on a next move?"

I've been trying to use Amtech 559 and heating it up so it will liquify flow under the chip but I don't think it's working so well. I've used Kester too but it seems substantially more toxic."
