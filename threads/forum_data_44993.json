        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",

        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "SMC_BATLOW_L": "What is SMC_BATLOW_L? SMC_BATLOW_L refers to a power management signal that indicates a low battery condition. The \"_L\" suffix suggests that this is an active-low signal, meaning that it becomes low when the battery reaches a low voltage threshold..",

Told him it needs fixing but he said he needed it at night, so came back the next day, mac died. Luckily not in my hands :). Anyway, I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q5060</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q5059</TRANSISTOR> and resistors around it. Also replaced <CAPACITOR>C4907</CAPACITOR> and <RESISTOR>R5250</RESISTOR> beside SMC. Then I replaced <RESISTOR>R6101</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C6100</CAPACITOR> that looked corroded. For the rest all looks pretty OK. Now i have green and orange light with battery plugged in, but missing <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>, I do have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. PPBus sits at 12.6v and I have 3.42v as well. Also there is a short in <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>, I see its also going to the area i replaced IC, but all resistor I changed measure OK. Should i first focus on the 5V, or are these related?"
