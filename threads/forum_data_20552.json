You could also bet all surrounding caps to ground to see if there are any shorts in the line any of these caps are on that will be another starting point. If nothing beeps, then connect the flex to it and beep again to look for any differences. It could just be the connector in some way, if you can find a replacement you can just remove the old connector then beep again for shorts then fit a different one and beep again."}
