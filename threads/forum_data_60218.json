        "A1706": "What is A1706? A1706 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3071, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00239, 820-00923..",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PPVCCGT_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCGT_S0_CPU? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVCCIO_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCIO_S0_CPU? PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is a power rail responsible for powering the part of the CPU responsible for communicating with other portions of the machine prior to PPVCORE_S0_CPU being present and must be present before vcore, PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is present when the machine is in an on, RUNNING state. .",

        "5V_S4": "What is 5V_S4? This is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S4” – when you see this, assume the person typing it meant to type “PP5V_S4”.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",

It stopped working a while back, and he just stopped using it and got a new one. He eventually gave it to me so I could take a look, just in case I could revive it.\nHe said it just stopped working one day, it wouldn't turn on anymore.\nHe also said that it was possible that there could have been a bit of liquid spill at some point, but wasn't too sure.\nAnd after taking the board out of the case, I don't think there was any liquid ingress, the board looks perfectly clean after inspection under microscope. No sign of liquid or corrosion anywhere.\n\nI have not tried messing with the BIOS yet, but this was indeed on the top of my list after I did the first analysis I posted up there. But I wanted to get some other opinion first. So you think I should try reflashing a clean BIOS ?"
