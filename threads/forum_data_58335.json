As i had donor board and there was liquid damage in smc area i changed it too.\n\nNow macbook is not turning on. Tried another SMC and same result. It get's 5.20V and 0.04 Amps on all usb-c ports. PPBUS is 0V. Lifted R6907 and getting 5V on pin 2.\n\n\nI dont thinkg it's one of ports ic (CD3215) because there is no water damage in that area."
