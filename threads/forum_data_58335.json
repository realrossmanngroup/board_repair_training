This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

As i had donor board and there was liquid damage in smc area i changed it too.\n\nNow macbook is not turning on. Tried another SMC and same result. It get's 5.20V and 0.04 Amps on all usb-c ports. PPBUS is 0V. Lifted <RESISTOR>R6907</RESISTOR> and getting 5V on pin 2.\n\n\nI dont thinkg it's one of ports ic (<CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>) because there is no water damage in that area."
