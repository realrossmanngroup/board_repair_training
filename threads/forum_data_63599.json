Just in case replaced <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> one more time but same issue.\nOn another side 20V and around 1A.\n\nThere is Apple logo, no progress bar but after 15 seconds fans spins at max and its restarts (it stays at 20V but current drop to 0.08A)\n\nOn that side with 5V both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> got correct LDOs in diode mode.\nTest 5V with USBC tester and all readings are correct.\n\nAny idea?"
