After a year, he says it didn't power on randomly, so he pulled the bottom case and said that he found a screw floating around in the system on the mobo. Says he kept it for another year, decided to try and charge it randomly - when it gave the boot sound but no video.\n\n(Before repairs preformed so far, there was no screen image or backlight) System fans and disk power up once for about 6 seconds, then off for about 5 then on again until I power it down. No screen or boot chime for the first cycle.\n\nTo the jucie details. <TRANSISTOR>Q9560</TRANSISTOR> was welded to the mobo. [ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t<SIGNAL>S20171205_0001</SIGNAL>.jpg Views:\t1 Size:\t309.7 KB ID:\t28896\"]28896._xfImport[/ATTACH] Repealed [ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t<SIGNAL>S20171205_0002</SIGNAL>.jpg Views:\t1 Size:\t305.0 KB ID:\t28898\"]28897._xfImport[/ATTACH] that's working fine now.\n\nWasn't getting any voltage on pin 4 (gate), figured that whatever got in, went out to <CHIP>U9500</CHIP>. Replaced and now im getting a strong 1.52V on my <SIGNAL>PP1V5_GPU_REG</SIGNAL>.\nI'm getting a pink or purple screen, after pram reset a white screen once. \"image\" looks torn or what I would imagine from a dead gpu.\n\nReistance from P1 on L9560 (<SIGNAL>GPU_REG</SIGNAL>) is 0.9 ohm or in diode mode 0.001 dead short. <CHIP>U8500</CHIP> and <CHIP>U8550</CHIP> get burning flesh hot after seconds of on time.... Do I have some bad ram or a shot GPU? or both...\n\nOpinions (with some explinations?)\n\nIm going to guess, that what ever took out <TRANSISTOR>Q9560</TRANSISTOR> was pretty hard and did something to the PP1V5 that would take out the <CHIP>U8500</CHIP> and <CHIP>U8550</CHIP> and potentially the GPU, but I havn't had experience with this before.\n\nNext move to pull <CHIP>U8500</CHIP> and <CHIP>U8550</CHIP> to see if the short disappears?\n\nThanks and happy repairs!"
