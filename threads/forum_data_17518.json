Replaced ~10 components that were broken-off/missing (mostly non-critical caps/resistors, etc). Confirmed all parts are now present on the board, but I can't restore power, with the following symptoms:\n\n1. Board has <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> all present and stable/normal, but <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is 0v.\n2. Pin 6 of <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is .8v, which I believe is normal, but pin 23 is 0v.\n3. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> is present and stable, despite pin 23 of <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> not being present (this confuses me).\n4. <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> is present and stable (3.45v)\n5. Charger light is solid green the entire time, but it flickers ever so slightly, as if it's trying to power on. All SMC power lines stable/normal.\n6. No shorts on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> or <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>\n7. Replaced <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> (twice--three total chips), <CHIP>U7941</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR>, no change\n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. All help appreciated--thanks!"

I get <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_3V3S5</SIGNAL> (<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL>) on pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C7241</CAPACITOR>, so <TRANSISTOR>Q7220</TRANSISTOR> is getting power. I won't lie, I've never been very comfortable with how MOSFETs work ([I]I've read so much information on P-type vs N-type, but I don't understand which voltages come and go in some of the Apple schematics; they always seem to look different than the sample diagrams online...more complex; I get gate/source/drain, but the Apple schematics always look so much more complex[/I]), but since <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_DRVL</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_DRVH</SIGNAL> are both gate signals (and output low/high MOSFET driver signals from <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>), does this mean <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is still at fault? At <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, pins 10 and 12 are both 0v."
