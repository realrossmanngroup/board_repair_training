When I plug the adapter there is no light and the fan start spinning loud."}

I cleaned the impacted area. This has few Proximity sensor and all look clean. Q5810, Q5830, Q5860 , Q5820 , Q5840 , Q5850 \n\nThe laptop will boot but very slow, fan is loud and no light on the adapter. I am going to order new I\/O board .. but do you think this can cause the FAN issue \/ sensor issue ?"}

My guess is liquid affected a sensor too, but you need known good parts first."}
