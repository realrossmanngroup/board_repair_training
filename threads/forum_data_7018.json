Do not turn on only 1 time pressing the power button, touch let sustained 6 seconds to turn pro macbook.\n2. You can not enter that state S3 is turned off, touch again let sustained 6 seconds to turn power button.\n3. THE ASD brings me 9 errors. These can cause the above problems?\nAnnex photos of the reports of ASD. Thank you."

Multimeter showed a resistence to GND 0.02Ohms. I extracted the <CAPACITOR>C5025</CAPACITOR> and the shorte disappeared, so the MacBook Pro turned on. I did the ADS and the error sensors desappeared, it's all OK. Then, the machine was turned on and working, but 20 minutes later the computer turned off, just by itself. Now i have green light on the magsafe AC,  but it doesn't turn on. The voltage is missing in <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> pin 3 and 8 =<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS_ROM</SIGNAL> .  When i try to turn it on, the fan has a little little movement but the machine doesn't turn on."
