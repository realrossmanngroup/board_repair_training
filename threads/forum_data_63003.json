            "message": "I got a water damaged <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01987</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>\n\ncame in with no back light.   water damage around <CHIP>U8400</CHIP>,   fixed trace damage and replaced <CHIP>U8400</CHIP>  Then found a blown fuse F8400.  After this the\nbacklight voltage came back but it would quickly fade away and only went to 12v not 50.  The CPU would quickly shutdown the backlight enable signal to <CHIP>U8400</CHIP>.   Seemed like the buck was bad.   Found <TRANSISTOR>Q8501</TRANSISTOR> \"FET\" shorted source to drain.   That explained the buck circuit problem.  Replaced that and I had back light.    Lots of chit chat between the driver and the screen then back to the cpu and then to the driver.   Check all these circuits when troubleshooting backlight on these.\n\nThen the next problem was no WiFI.   WiFI not shorted and rail was good but thermal showed slight edge glow which usually means WiFi/Bluetooth module is bad.  This is a underfilled part.  I was concerned that it was married to the machine and that even if I changed it it would not work.   Lots of labor on a underfilled part of this size.  Well I changed it anyway and to my surprise the WiFI did work!\n\nLessons learned:\n* Check that buck FET on water damaged no backlight.  ( IF pulse only goes to 12v not 50v on startup )\n* WiFi module can be replaced!\n\nHope this helps someone."
