            "message": "So this case is really weird. I got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> after slight water damage around  J8500 and <CHIP>U8500</CHIP>/<CHIP>U8501</CHIP>. I have replaced <CHIP>U8500</CHIP>/<CHIP>U8501</CHIP>, J8500 and eDP connector on LCD side. Also put new eDP flex. I've found out, that <SIGNAL>EDP_AUXCH_C_P</SIGNAL> line is shorted, so I've replaced <CHIP>U9850</CHIP>. Now computer turns on, there is an image, but only on system loading screen. Before login screen show up both image and backlight dissapear. On touchbar there is an onformation, that external monitor is connected (but in fact there is nothing connected...) and choose what to do: clone or extend screen. Nothing happens if I press the options. If I turn on computer in safe mode image works all the time, I can log in to profile. If I connect external display it works too, there is an image on the screen and external display, but as soon as I disconnect external screen after 2-3 seconds internal screen gets black. I have replaced <CHIP>U9850</CHIP> three times, I took them from the same board and <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board - no difference. I have tested another good screen and again - no difference."
