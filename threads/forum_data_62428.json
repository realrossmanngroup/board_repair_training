I need help, please.\nThis MacBook had liquid damage around C7661(replaced), R5430(resolder), Q7660 and Q7680(All cleaned with flux), small oxidation on C6532.\nAfter cleaning all corrosion and resoldering some components I've cleaned with Ultra Sonic cleaning.\nMeasuring on L9060 it starts on 12.60V then drops to 12.30 for 3 secs and back to 12.60.\nPPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H starts with 12.61V and drops to 12.30V for a few secs and back to 12.61V.\nI've replaced even U7650 and still the same issue.\nCan't boot in internet mode or from an external system it keeps rebooting.\nCan someone point me in some direction?\nThanks"}

The audio card had U.S cleaning.\nI tried to boot with the audio board disconnected and the same.\nDFU mode works and revives option goes all steps fine. But after restarts the same issue.\nIt keeps restarting after trying to boot.\nIt's not working on the battery, only with the charger connected.\nI've done this video showing the voltage-in.\n[MEDIA=youtube]8H4FaqGZy8o[\/MEDIA]"}
