I installed a new OS and checked the board no liquid or anything on it. Sometimes it works fine all day, but sometimes when I wanna make a restart it will freeze. Any ideas? \n\nThanks"}

Only takes the shut down and restart when it's connected externally. I also tried another LCD Assembly it's the same, gets stuck when on the internal screen. Temps are fine normal levels. When connected with external it has 2-3sec delay once pressed restart or shut down and it will continue not get stuck"}

When plugged in externally with the software running or not all works well. I advised the client and they will probably use it externally at the office. It's a pity the MacBook it's in excellent condition and not used a lot it's brand new. \n\nThanks for the assistance :)"}
