            "message": "Hey All,\n\nI did something very, very, very stupid! During LCD replacement (complete assembly) i was convinced i did but did not disconnect the battery. During reconnection of the new screen, there was a small flash and the machine turned on, i soon that realised that the battery still connected and quickly disconnected the battery. \n\nAfter reassembly i discovered that the webcam is not recognised, so i though f##k! I threw on the old screen and the outcome was the same.2 \n\nWhat is happening now, the machine is powering on and charging, the screen is powering on, in fact everything seems good apart from the webcam and the keyboard light.\nI have spoken with the owner, he is going to back up what is needed and than we can have a closer look.\n\nIf any has any ideas, would very much welcome any help!"
