Also <CAPACITOR>C3101</CAPACITOR> was looking nasty, I replace the caps, no shorts detected, just ugly caps.\nWhen I plug the original charger with an amp meter I get steady 5.11V in XA port. XB port pulses 5 seconds in 5.11V then goes to 0V for 1 second and up to 5.11V. Ports on the other side do the same.\n\nI replace <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>, but keeps doing the same.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.39V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO</SIGNAL> 3.36V\n<SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS</SIGNAL>= 5.11V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> = 5.12V\n<SIGNAL>UPC_XA_GATE1</SIGNAL> = 11.01V\n<SIGNAL>UPC_XA_GATE2</SIGNAL> = 7.18V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOA</SIGNAL> = 1.77V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOD</SIGNAL> = 1.79V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC</SIGNAL> =1.11V\n\nShould I replace <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> again or look for something else?"
