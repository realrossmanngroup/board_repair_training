The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",

(therefore not keyboard) \n- Computer will run on battery power alone, but not turn on when only battery is connected \n- Computer will auto power on when connected to DC charger and functions normally, however will auto power back on when shut down.\n\nMy \"Guess\" for what is going on here is that the laptop thinks there is no battery connected. \n\nSYS Detect L = 250mv approx, and I've changed batteries and DC in boards, plus an SMC reset. \nPPVBat = 7.5v\n\ninvestigating further but any tips are appreciated :)"
