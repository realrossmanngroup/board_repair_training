        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
