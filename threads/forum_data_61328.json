            "message": "Hey I am problems with a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board.\n\nCame in no power found that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_SSD0_SNS</SIGNAL> was shorted.  Found the short at <CAPACITOR>C9500</CAPACITOR>. removed and system booted. Amp  meter on the charging port was reading 20v at 70amps and not charging so immediately I knew there was a problem. Took it down and did some testing on dcin and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and they were normal. I suspect that now i have fully burnt out something because I am now only getting 5v 0.01amps from the amp meter and no power again.\n\nDCIN- 5v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>- 0.6v\n\nDid the CD chip get fried? or may was it already on its way out with that high ampage? Can someone tell me what lines I should start checking to get this sorted? I dont think it should be too major because the system was booting after i cleared that SSD short"

I see dc in goes into the mosfet <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> and is output as the gates which go to isl <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Just to see i changed the mosfets but still no output on the gates. I see these gates run to <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, could it be <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> causing the lines to drop?\n\nwhich lines do you need diode readings for?"
