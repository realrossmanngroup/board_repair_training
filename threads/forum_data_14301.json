Spinning fan and orange light. Fan restarts 3 x and then does not boot, i do see the screen is turning on. Checked the SMC and U6100. Some pads have discoloring but no real signs of liquid damage. USB Mouse lights up. Pin 8 U1950 has 3.42v. No short on the pins of U6100 and resistors measure OK. What more should I check?"}
