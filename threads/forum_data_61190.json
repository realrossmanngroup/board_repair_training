After removing/replacing both right channel amps the board does not run off of battery but starts up and works normally.\n\nSystem report sees battery, plugged in, does not charge, and does not run off battery.\n\nCSI P/N and <SIGNAL>CSO_N</SIGNAL>/P all measure right.  <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> measure fine. PPBUS 12.6.\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> is 12.6 source, 12.6 gate, 2V on batt side.  Is this the problem? Everything with battery connected."

I'm getting the chime in the right channel with the same speaker, but no audible sound on the left.   \n\nMy ocilliscope shows activity on the subwoofer channel during the chime duration oddly.  I checked the \"shutdown\" enable called <SIGNAL>AUD_SPKRAMP_SHUTDOWN_L</SIGNAL> and it goes high to 3.0V when the chime goes and returns to 0 when chime is done.\n\nI'll do SMC / PRAM reset just in case but I think it's not muted/hard right balance in the OS"

I have a donor board that I'm going to take measurements from but in the meantime does anyone have any ideas?"
