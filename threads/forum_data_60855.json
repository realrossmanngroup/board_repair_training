Hole burned into the board under connector. Shorting <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS</SIGNAL>. No matter how much I dug, i was not able to relieve this short. So, instead of continuing to dig into this board, I decided to bypass this line. What I did was remove the corresponding CD, mask the 4 pads under the CD for this line, then ran jumper from <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS</SIGNAL> under the CD. \n\nThis got me to 20v.\n\n[B]Current state:[/B]\nCurrently the device is drawing 20v at about 100mA.\n\n[B]Power Rails: [/B]\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL>: 5v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3S</SIGNAL>: 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL>: 1.8\n<SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL>: 2.5v\n<SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>: 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>: 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S5</SIGNAL>: 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_LDO</SIGNAL>: 5v\n\nSo, it looks like <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>, is this correct? Also, are there other prerequisites for the s5 rails to come alive? \n\nThanks for the advice"
