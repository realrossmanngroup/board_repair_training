        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A 2012 MacBook Pro, No Backlight\n\nI have verified it is no backlight and not no video. Shining a light through the Apple logo, I can see an image (well the LCD is busted, so lines appear.) Video also displays correctly on an external display.\n\nI have measure Backlight output and I get ZERO (0)V.\n\nI was going over Louis' MacBook air no backlight sticky and started following that \"guide\".\n\nI have no short to ground on the line. I also couldn't initially find any break in traces from L9710 to <DIODE>D9701</DIODE>. I was looking at the voltage divider made up of <RESISTOR>R9731</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R9715</RESISTOR> (which I actually believe are the same call-outs for the resistors on my board) and the one does measure 100ohm (99.2) and the other measures 150-180ohm (It should be 301ohm)...\n\nI found another 301ohm from a donor board and replaced it and when put on this board, it also measures 150-180ohm.\n\nThe board had some liquid \"damage\" it did seem minimal, as I did see some around pin 32 of the LCD board connector (the LCD cable connector looks perfect), but it was just some tiny bit of blue/green oxidation.\n\nI am at work (however I did bring the board/computer assembly) and I can take more measurements, if would help any of you, to help me.\n\n**I also measured the return line resistors and I basically get 0ohm for each one, even though the schematic says they should be 10.2 ohm, can I just chalk that up to Apple Schematic being incorrect (the Air return line resistors do say they should be 0ohm)**"
