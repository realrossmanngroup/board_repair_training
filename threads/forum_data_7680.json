        "message":"820-3332-A 2012 MacBook Pro, No Backlight\n\nI have verified it is no backlight and not no video. Shining a light through the Apple logo, I can see an image (well the LCD is busted, so lines appear.) Video also displays correctly on an external display.\n\nI have measure Backlight output and I get ZERO (0)V.\n\nI was going over Louis' MacBook air no backlight sticky and started following that \"guide\".\n\nI have no short to ground on the line. I also couldn't initially find any break in traces from L9710 to D9701. I was looking at the voltage divider made up of R9731 and R9715 (which I actually believe are the same call-outs for the resistors on my board) and the one does measure 100ohm (99.2) and the other measures 150-180ohm (It should be 301ohm)...\n\nI found another 301ohm from a donor board and replaced it and when put on this board, it also measures 150-180ohm.\n\nThe board had some liquid \"damage\" it did seem minimal, as I did see some around pin 32 of the LCD board connector (the LCD cable connector looks perfect), but it was just some tiny bit of blue\/green oxidation.\n\nI am at work (however I did bring the board\/computer assembly) and I can take more measurements, if would help any of you, to help me.\n\n**I also measured the return line resistors and I basically get 0ohm for each one, even though the schematic says they should be 10.2 ohm, can I just chalk that up to Apple Schematic being incorrect (the Air return line resistors do say they should be 0ohm)**"
