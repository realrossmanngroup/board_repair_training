        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",

        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H? This is the input from the USB-C charger or the battery that is the input voltage for the chip responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H. It can be missing when capacitors on this line are shorted to ground, or when the diode in front of it leading to the chip that creates PP3V3_G3H is blown. .",

This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on.."
