        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",

            "message": "Hi, i have a retina here. this mac gotten power on sometimes without backlight and sometimes no power, but always has green/orange light.\n\nhad corrosion on the mentioned parts \n<CAPACITOR>C1214</CAPACITOR> Has corrosion on the Pin one, miss the pad and i remove the older Cap and put from a identical donor the same cap. before replace it, i remove all the corrosion on the pad, put the cap on and run a jumper to Pin 1 of the <CAPACITOR>C1212</CAPACITOR>. \n\nCorrosion on <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR>. i replaced it with a same from identical board. and i fix some missing ways missing by the corrosion.\n\nCorrosion on <RESISTOR>R5350</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5351</RESISTOR>. The pads and the Resistors are ok, only resold and recover the pads.\n\nCorrosion On <RESISTOR>R9753</RESISTOR>. i recover the pads and replaced the resistor.\n\nCorrosi√≥n on <CAPACITOR>C7400</CAPACITOR>, i recover the pad and replace the cap.\n\nSo, thing is.. When i finish the fix, still not working. i tried some chargers and nothing. Gotten power on twice after the fix with working backlight and all ok, but when i put the board on the case doesn't work anymore. \ntaking some measures, a lot of power rails are present, <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> are present. But!. no have any voltaje on the S4 State and S3.\nChecking i realize actually does not have <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> signal\n\nSo, looking whole board this is not present in any part on the board. <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> Is not present.\ni dont know what to do. \n\nHelpme plz"
