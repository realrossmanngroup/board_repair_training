The pads and the Resistors are ok, only resold and recover the pads.\n\nCorrosion On R9753. i recover the pads and replaced the resistor.\n\nCorrosi\u00f3n on C7400, i recover the pad and replace the cap.\n\nSo, thing is.. When i finish the fix, still not working. i tried some chargers and nothing. Gotten power on twice after the fix with working backlight and all ok, but when i put the board on the case doesn't work anymore. \ntaking some measures, a lot of power rails are present, SMC_RESET_L are present. But!. no have any voltaje on the S4 State and S3.\nChecking i realize actually does not have PM_SLP_S4_L signal\n\nSo, looking whole board this is not present in any part on the board. PM_PCH_PWROK Is not present.\ni dont know what to do. \n\nHelpme plz"}

But it can be corrosion anywhere. You saw where the corrosion was so those would be the first areas to inspect. So crap under U7400 is likely too as C7400 was fucked also inspect traces there."}
