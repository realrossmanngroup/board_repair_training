Found a general li-ion protection board diagram but not specific enough to help. \nWould like to figure out how to reverse the triggers that send a signal to ‘replace now’ or detect gas. (Not disable for obvious safety reasons). \n\nHave a a lot of these building up. Would rather rebuild than create a ridiculous power bank."
