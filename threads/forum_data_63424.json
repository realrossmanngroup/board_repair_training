        "message":"so have a macbook pro 13\" 2009 A1298. came to me with not booting. \n\non diagnosing found if i removed the screen the thing would boot and chime. replaced the screen with a known working one and same issue. replaced the backlight driver ic and still the same issue. Now at a loss as what could be causing it. with the screen in you get fan spin and as soon as it starts to chime it turns off along with the fan. \n\nAny help would be appriciated.\n\nThanks.\n\nSteve"
