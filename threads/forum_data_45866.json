        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7050": "What is D7050? Diodes between SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL and ground, these data lines allow the battery to communicate with the battery charging chip and the SMC..",
        "C7050": "What is C7050? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for battery current sensing, you should measure around 2.202 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "C7060": "What is C7060? a CAPACITOR.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",

        "R7050": "What is R7050? Current sense shunt resistor for the battery, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 17/18 on ISL6259 should give you 2.02 ohms. ."

            "message": "Good morning all.\nI know I am probaly going to get trolled here and the problem is more than likely so evident.... but I dont seem to be able to locate the issue or what I am looking for as I am getting strange readings. So as follows:-\nJ7050\npin 7/8/9/16/17/18-- gnd\npin 4/13-- alternates 3.42v - 4.78v and various incarnations close to either end ( i.e. 3.42v may be 3.429/ 3.427/ 3.426 and 4.78 may go 4.47/46/48) never steady\npin 5/14 -- 3.42v static\npin 6/15-- 0.00v\npin -- nc\npin 1/2/3/10/11/2-- initial shows 12.58v then drops to 3.419v then rises to 12.58v then drops to 3.419v ongoing\n\neven though openboardview and the schematic show 4/5 as NC there is definatly voltages there.\n\nWhen I turned the board over and looked under the scope <DIODE>D7050</DIODE> was cracked, so I replaced this. <CAPACITOR>C7050</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7060</CAPACITOR> seem OK.\n\nHere is the issues, MBP came into me initially after having a bottle of Ribena poured over it. Refused to power on even though LED on magsafe was there. Went over the board and replaced a few components and cleaned. It then powers on with no problem with exception of the battery was not detected or charging and the fan would not spin initially, however after about 5 mins of use it did spin. Went over the voltages at J7050 and all were correct as far as I could see. A new battery ( genuine ( aparantly)) was purchased and installed. All worked fine, battery was detected and charged to 100%. The MBP even though the fan did not spin initially and did not over heat worked fine.\n\nIt has now come back again with the battery not detected and not charging, the fan issue still persists but the MBP boots and works perfectly despite these issues.\n\nThe voltages I have listed above are not the same readings as before the battery change. The reason I mentioned the fan is it may or maynot be connected to the issue.... I just do not know.\n\nFrom my limited experience, I feel the issue is the SMC but I may be wrong.\n\nCan anyone enlighten me as to what the readings should be and what I should be looking for.\nMany Thanks."

            "message": "sorry for the delay in coming back to you, something really odd is going on.....\nSo, I have an Isotech IDM 505 Multimeter.\nWhen I test for a short to ground on pins 4/5/13/14 i get a quick beep and the display shows O.L and on pins 6/15 i get no beep and O.L on the display. Now I am expecting to see a reading in KOhms. I fell in to this trap before where i read in resistance mode and not diode mode so made sure I have it correct this time. To make sure, a colleague of mine that does TV repairs did the same checks with his Fluke 115 which yielded the same results.\n\nFor good measure I tested for a short at pin 11 on <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> for <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL</SIGNAL> which again quick beep and 0.L and pin 10 on <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> for <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA</SIGNAL> again with short beep and 0.L. Again <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> pin 1 for <SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_L</SIGNAL> yields no beep and 0.L\n\nEvery time I have seen our friend Louis test for short to ground there has always been a reading other than 0.L\nMy TV guy reckons there is no short.... is this correct?"
