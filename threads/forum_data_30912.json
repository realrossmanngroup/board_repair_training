This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on.."

Replaced all bad components, replaced <CHIP>U6901</CHIP>, <CHIP>U5010</CHIP>, SMC, SMC Reset 100K <RESISTOR>R5000</RESISTOR> Resistor, and pulled <RESISTOR>R7000</RESISTOR> to see if <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> was resetting it somehow.\n\nIm kind of lost, the voltage when I meter the line is 3.4-3.42v but it may be dipping when I first stick my probe to it. It seems this line is pulled up to 3.42 at the <RESISTOR>R5000</RESISTOR> resistor but I have tested and replaced this and no change.\nThe computer will boot and charge fine. When you plug in the charger the light goes green to orange and charges but when you unplug the charger it will reset the system like you just pulled power and then reconnected it instantly. Kind of lost on how this is happening."
