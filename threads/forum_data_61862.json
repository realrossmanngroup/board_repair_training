        "message":"Hello. \nI have this 820-3115-A.\nInitially turns on for 3 seconds and then off. Had a lot of liquid damage around and under U1800. I protected U1800, added flux and reflowed the area and cleaned with ultrasonic cleaner. \n\nThen the board had the same issue and I noticed that U7000 was getting a little hot (noticed it with thermal camera) so I replaced it, after that PP3V42_G3H went to 4V so replaced R7021 and R7022 and PP3V42_G3H is ok again but no green light and no attempt to turn on, just takes 37mA.\n\nI reflowed the SMC and no change.\n\nAny suggestion?\n\n\nThanks!!"
