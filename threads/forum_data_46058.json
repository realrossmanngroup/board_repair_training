The board looks superclean, only one liquid indicator is a little red on the edge of the board, looks like not much hit the board. Even around the liquid indicator that was red all looks clean. I checked voltage, it actually turns on I get 19.5v and then the Amps move up for about 15 seconds from 1.4Amps to 1.55 and then drops to 0v, 19.5v still showing. CPU also gets hot, tried to boot from external drive, light up 15 seconds and then turns off. Any ideas what could cause this? Tomorrow will start measuring all voltages but if anyone has an indication where to look, that would be appreciated."}

I measured voltages around CPU, actually the GPU gets 0.9 volts. CPU GPU was hot but CPU cold while fan was spinning. I get 0v on L7420, would there be a chance that the CPU powersupply failed? Or should i stop wasting my time?"}

Now I reassembled it it keeps at 0.42 degree same as GPU, fan is spinning hapiilly, but no power to CPU. I did give it another ultrasonic before assembling, wouldnt be the first time some stuff came back to life after that...."}
