We repair at least one of these per week, and replacing <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> resolves issue about 90% of the time. Another thing you really need to check on these is the pins on iSight connector itself--both inside connector and external. I've had a dozen or so of these 00165 boards that actually had loose pins at the board; they just didn't have enough solder and broke free at some point. Lastly, I've seen several that had a pin very slightly lodged/stuck inside connector so it wasn't making good contact. If BIOS has been fucked with, then disregard all of this and start there!"
