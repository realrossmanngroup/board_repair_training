I just finished testing 2 -820-3437 and the FaceTime works fine :\/ I tried PRAM and installed a new OS X on my test drive \nBoth 820-00165 where water damaged but no where near Anything todo with camera \none was near smc the other had near PP3v3_SUS I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s the issue also the test chassis is a 2013 air shell if they helps"}

I\u2019m currently check the voltages and CAM_SENSOR_WAKE_L_CONN R4031, R4030 and L4009, L4007 to see if there\u2019s any physical damage or liquid.

We repair at least one of these per week, and replacing U3900 resolves issue about 90% of the time. Another thing you really need to check on these is the pins on iSight connector itself--both inside connector and external. I've had a dozen or so of these 00165 boards that actually had loose pins at the board; they just didn't have enough solder and broke free at some point. Lastly, I've seen several that had a pin very slightly lodged\/stuck inside connector so it wasn't making good contact. If BIOS has been fucked with, then disregard all of this and start there!"}
