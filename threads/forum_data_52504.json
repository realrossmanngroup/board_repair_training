( option + R)? I don't have a actual machine or keyboard to test with. Working on that.\nand this one....\n\n\nThe board shows 20V on the charger and pulls 0.39A. That current draw is pretty solid and the board does not appear to be booting up. On the working board that current draw is all over the place as the CPU is pushing bits around so this appears to be doing nothing.\n\nAll the S0 rails are present.\n\nThe CPU is not enabling the screen 3V3 voltage so obviously it is not getting very far. I think it is brain dead.\nAll the CPU rails are normal and resistance to ground is similar to my other boards. It does not look like a shorted CPU.\n\nI have done a physical inspection and checked all rails. I have done thermal and I see no smoking guns. It compares well to the working board.  Thermal is tricky on these as the board is so small and it gets warm all over so fast.   But playing back the thermal video and comparing they look the same."
