After repair it everything is working fine except upper line keys ( volume, brightness etc) they are stucked at F1,F2,F3 functions not special keys). It's not software issue, tested customers ssd on my macbook air is ok, testing my ssd on customer macbook also not working. Already tried keyboard, trackpad, flexes and the only thing remains is the logic board. Even activating FN special keys in preferences it is continuing to work like F1, F2, etc. \n\n\nAny idea what it can be? The logic board seems to be ok visually. \n\n\nThe damage was near backlight ic"
