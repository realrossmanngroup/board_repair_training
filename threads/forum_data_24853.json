            "message": "I have again a strange Macbook Air 11\", it turns on but is extremly slow and the fan is going up to max. speed after a 5-10seconds.\n\nNo visible liquid damage, tried another battery, harddiscs, all resets and also exchanged the logicboard into a different macbook air. Always same behaviour.\n\nOn the apple ASD test I got only 2 errors:\n\n-thunderbolt sleep wake test\n-tim test 75percent GB\nPictures are attached!\n\nI have checked especially die CPU temp sensor circuit, all ok. All other voltages are also ok.\nFollowing voltages are going down when the fan is on highspeed, but I assume thats normal due the strange problem:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU_REG</SIGNAL> down to 0,8 instead 1,25\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG_REG</SIGNAL> 0,45 instead of 1,05\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3_CPU_VCCDQ</SIGNAL> 0,84 instead of 1,5\n\nAny hint and idea is very appreciated!"
