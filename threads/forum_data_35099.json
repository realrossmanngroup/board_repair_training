            "message": "Uhm, of course after reflowing the VRAM it will work again. You just heated up the GPU so it will work again for 3-6 months or so. Do you really think that Apple and the rest of the world is replacing the GPU for nothing? \nI do 15-20 of these a week so I kind of know what I'm talking about here.\n\nIf a board comes back after a GPU replacement (<10%) then I reflow the VRAM. Most of them come back again after that and then the issue is inside the board traces. In case of a 6750 or 6770 I can attempt a downgrade to a 6490 GPU but if that still fails it is the end of the line for the board."
