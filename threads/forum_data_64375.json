When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution.

I ended up replacing <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> because I was not getting 1.2v where I should have been. The higher voltages at first were present. After looking back at TP GPU_CLKREQ_L__R, I cleaned it up and the center pad was gone, I tried to scrape the board with a diamond tipped pen but I could not get the solder to adhere. There was however part of the trace from this TP still there. I scraped that area and routed a jumper wire from there to <RESISTOR>R1945</RESISTOR> pin 2. Continuity to those areas checked out. I am however not getting any S5. I keep coming back to <CHIP>U1200</CHIP> being a possible issue?\n\nUSB-C meter shows 20v but pulls almost no amps other then when first plugging in it shoots up to .27 amps but drops to about .02 amps thereafter but maintains 20v.\nWhat should I be testing or looking for next?"
