        "U4801": "What is U4801? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "BUTTON_DISABLE": "What is BUTTON_DISABLE? BUTTON_DISABLE disables the trackpad when SMC_LID is below 0.5v and the system believes the lid is closed. .",

        "USB_TPAD_P": "What is USB_TPAD_P? USB_TPAD_P is the positive signal in a USB data signal transferring keyboard & trackpad use to the CPU from the trackpad. .",

        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
