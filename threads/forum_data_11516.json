It happens approximately once upon 10 reboots.\nWhen it hangs I can see the mouse and caps lock is working. When OS boots ok I see the kernel panics report.\n\nI tried to boot it with external USB HDD and there is no error.\nIt passes both OS and EFI ASD.\nI suspected bad SSD, but this one is fully working in a 2012 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, and I have same issue with other SSD...\n\nI attached 2 kernel panics crashes.\n\nIf needed I will try to include a verbose mode list but the crash doesn't happen when I want to catch it :)\nAny hints where to start? I am thinking about the sata redriver circuit, but I really have no clue especially when no damage is apparent."
