        "message":"This 2012 A1465 macbook air has kernel panics from time to time (approximately 1 reboot on 10).\nNo water damage, never been opened, according to the mint condition casing I don't suspect a drop.\nKernel panics occurs during the boot, it hangs approximately in the middle of the apple progress bar. It happens approximately once upon 10 reboots.\nWhen it hangs I can see the mouse and caps lock is working. When OS boots ok I see the kernel panics report.\n\nI tried to boot it with external USB HDD and there is no error.\nIt passes both OS and EFI ASD.\nI suspected bad SSD, but this one is fully working in a 2012 A1466, and I have same issue with other SSD...\n\nI attached 2 kernel panics crashes.\n\nIf needed I will try to include a verbose mode list but the crash doesn't happen when I want to catch it :)\nAny hints where to start? I am thinking about the sata redriver circuit, but I really have no clue especially when no damage is apparent."
