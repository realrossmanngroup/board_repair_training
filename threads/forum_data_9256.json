        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

            "message": "Got this board in with very light liquid damage. A few burned resistors near the SMC and <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> were replaced. Green/orange light and a fan spin for about 1 second, then off. No cycling. Checked SPI ROM, area looks good, but tested without chip in place (no fan cycling) and also with another SPI ROM just to see if it would affect anything, it didn't. Replaced original SPI ROM chip. Decided to reflow SMC since there was liquid nearby, and no change. Pulled SMC to make sure nothing ugly underneath, and it was really clean. While SMC was removed, I checked continuity of all BIOS lines and they're all good. Resistors all measure properly. Replaced SMC.\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is present (3.3v), <SIGNAL>PM_DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is present (3.38v), as is everything up to <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> as far as I can tell. When charger is connected, fan spins briefly and VCORE/<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> both spike/pulse, but then to 0v and the board has no power again. Main rails present, no shorts. Everything after <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> missing.\n\nAnything I can check before deciding the CPU is dead?"

It seems that after the fan turns on briefly, and then back off, I have everything before <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> steady (3v3/5v/1.05v sustains, etc). <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> is the first signal to be gone after the brief power-on.\n\nAs soon as charger is connected, VCORE spikes to 1.05v according to my scope.\n\nI'll check around SMC again, but have checked very well and everything is in place and no visibly damages or ugly resistors."
