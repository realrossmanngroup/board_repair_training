Replaced U7200 and power was restored.\nIntermittent keyboard and trackpad only clicked, didn't track. Light on MagSafe would be green for 10 sec, then off for a few sec, then back to green.\nReplaced U5701 and keyboard is now 100%, MagSafe LED also acts normal now. Still no tracking on the trackpad though. USB keyboard\/mouse also intermittently didn't work,\nFinally replaced U2700 as I get 0V on R5702. USB is now acting normal but this made no difference for the trackpad. tested with two other trackpads that show the same issue.\n\nNot sure where to take it from here.\nBoard did not suffer liquid damage."}

According to schematic they should be there? It doesn't mention OMIT or NOSTUFF but the pads have not been used, checked a few donor boards and they don't have those components either. No tin, scrapes or pits, just unused gold contacts.\n\nI do get 5V where those components should be according to schematic. If none of the donor boards have them either I'm assuming the schematic is wrong here, what do you think?"}
