        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1700": "What is U1700? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "C4902": "What is C4902? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C4903": "What is C4903? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C4908": "What is C4908? a CAPACITOR.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "C1600": "What is C1600? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

Also had a lot of corrosion from water damage on the underside of the board and I had to make a couple of jumpers on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> at <CAPACITOR>C4903</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C4908</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C4902</CAPACITOR>.\n\nIt has been running fine for a few weeks apparently but now it won't turn on - the fan spins for a split second and then straight off. If I have the charger plugged in it will attempt to turn on every ~5 seconds.\n\nI'm getting green and orange lights.\n\nAny suggestions as to where to start would be greatly appreciated."
