Got a new one from a donor board and I've tried downloading the files with clean ME available on the forum and editing the SN\/fixing checksum, and while I followed through Piernov's videos and managed to flash\/verify with my CH341 I'm almost certain I mucked something up - I soldered the chip onto the board to test without doing anything to it and it booted half way through the loading bar, but now the board is only power cycling and doesn't turn on. Would someone be able to generate a BIOS for SN C1MQ4K9ZG940 so I can rule out my own mistakes in editing the BIOS file? Thanks so much!"}
