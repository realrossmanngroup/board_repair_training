    "definitions": {
        "820-2915": "What is 820-2915? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PPVBAT_G3H_CONN": "What is PPVBAT_G3H_CONN? This is the where the batteryâ€™s power rail connects to the motherboard. .",
        "CHGR_BGATE": "What is CHGR_BGATE? a SIGNAL.",
        "P3V3_S5": "What is P3V3_S5? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7913": "What is R7913? a RESISTOR.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. ."

The <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> FET and its surrounding components are missing - still looking to see where this comes from.\n\nEDIT2: <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> not present at <RESISTOR>R7913</RESISTOR>/pin2.\n\nWhy all the funny ones come to me? I mean I really need one or two with just a blown BKL fuse to maintain mental health...\n\nthanks in advance guys."
