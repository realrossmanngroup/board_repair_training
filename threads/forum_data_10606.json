Any ideas what might be the cause of this? Seems to be a common fault related to battery. apart from the battery draining fast and showing a red battery icon at about 20% I haven't noticed anything else wrong with the battery\n\nThanks"}

I just gave it a full charge, seems fine now. Perhaps when the battery % is low, It thinks the battery is not connected at all and auto powers like it does when the battery is disconnected.\n\nSo I'm going to assume this is a battery issue"}
