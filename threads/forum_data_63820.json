        "A2179": "What is A2179? A2179 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2020 with EMC 3302, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01958..",
        "CD3217": "What is CD3217? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "ISL95828": "What is ISL95828? a CHIP.",
        "PP5V_G3S": "What is PP5V_G3S? PP5V_G3S is a 5v power rail present when the system is in a G3S standby state.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "P5VG3S_EN": "What is P5VG3S_EN? This signal enables the PP5V_G3S power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "A1932": "What is A1932? A1932 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Late 2018, 2019 with EMC 3184, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01521..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. ."

Audio board, fan and battery were liquid damaged but the mainboard seemed fine. Tried to start up using only mainboard and screen which made for a very slow MacBook.\nReplaced battery and connected trackpad/keyboard flex and worked nice and smoothly again.\nCleaned the rest and connected one by one, but after the audio board flex the laptop does not give 20v anymore\nRemoving this flex now doesn't change the situation. Its on 5v even with only adapter connected.\nChecked voltages around <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>: no <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL>\nChecked around <CHIP>ISL95828</CHIP>: VCC no voltage, VIN 12.15 and jumping shortly to 11V every 3 seconds\nIs this the symptom of a faulty fried ISL, or can the jumping be a symptom of the CPU trying to boot when there is 5v and no 20v?"
