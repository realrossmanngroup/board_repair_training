        "message":"Someone came in with an A2179 which had a liquid spill which wasn't noticed until an hour later. Audio board, fan and battery were liquid damaged but the mainboard seemed fine. Tried to start up using only mainboard and screen which made for a very slow MacBook.\nReplaced battery and connected trackpad\/keyboard flex and worked nice and smoothly again.\nCleaned the rest and connected one by one, but after the audio board flex the laptop does not give 20v anymore\nRemoving this flex now doesn't change the situation. Its on 5v even with only adapter connected.\nChecked voltages around CD3217: no PP5V_G3S\nChecked around ISL95828: VCC no voltage, VIN 12.15 and jumping shortly to 11V every 3 seconds\nIs this the symptom of a faulty fried ISL, or can the jumping be a symptom of the CPU trying to boot when there is 5v and no 20v?"
