I have tried minimum system configuration, different flash drives, different os's. It also freezes on an os install\/setup screen and even before loading into the os (apple logo with mouse) . Basically to it seems to me I have narrowed it down to the logic board, Is there anything I can do?\n\nit just freezes, no video distortion, does not restart, external mouse does not work either."}
