All power rails present turned on one time when I did an smc reset then wouldn't turn on again? What the history behinds these do the video chips go bad on them is this a cpu issue? the board is like $200 on ebay so i think it might be worth repairing. Do these units need a known good working battery to power up. The battery charges normally given by the green leds on the side.. and shows full leds when pressing the button. Just wont turn on. Weird. i tried shorting the pads but maybe im shorting the wrong ones and the fact that it turned on once has me puzzled."}

If it is a 2330 then it is probably a bad C7771. 1.05V on that bus will be 0.3V or something. Replace with a normal size cap, frankenstein it in there."}
