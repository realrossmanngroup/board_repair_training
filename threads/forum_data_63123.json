        "message":"Hello people.\n\nI've purchased this mid 2017 13\" MacBook Pro touchbar, logic board number 820-00923 who don't recognize internal SSD anymore. When powered on it display the question mark. Seller says that it simply stop working one day, no liquid spill, failed update or so. It can operate perfectly installing MacOs on external drive, but internal SSD storage does not show up in online recovery nor when external hard drive is plugged it to launch MacOs.\n\nI decided to open it and try to resolve the problem. Never been opened or worked before for sure.\n\nInspecting the board under the microscope show this two little spot of corrosion:\n\nprobe point TP[1]TP_Q3100_DRAIN , picture show before and after cleaning\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60796[\/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60797[\/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60798[\/ATTACH]\nand LB300\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60799[\/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60800[\/ATTACH]\nI can't find any other spot or phisical damage on this board. \n\nJ9600 (lifeboat port) also look good. \n\nI can confirm CD3215 ACE controller works fine, it does negotiate the 20V and I can boot up and charge the battery.\n\nAs mentionend many times as possible trouble point, R9350 related to PPVIN_2V7NAND_LB measures 13.8V in both test point and pin1 and 1.58V on pin 2.\n\nI'm not so good looking at schematics as this is not my work, just hobby for myself. I made those measurement taking a cue on other posts, so please forgive me if I'm completely wrong. Just wanna learn something and have fun.\n\n\nC9126 - PP1V8_SSD_COLD - 1.8V diode mode 294 (2K scale)\nC9304 - PP0V9_SSD_FIXED - 0.9V diode mode 294 (2K scale)\nC8724 - PP1V2_SSD_HOT - 1.22V diode mode 328 (2K scale)\nC8714 - PP1V8_SSD_HOT - 1.8V diode mode 408 (2K scale)\nC8732 - PP1V2_SSD_COLD - 1.22V diode mode 282 (2K scale)\nC9323 - PP0V9_SSD_REG - 0.9 diode mode 208 (2K scale)\n\nI measured also PP3V3_S5_SSD and it's 3.34V. \n\nI got 0 voltage at L9300\/20\/30\/40 and L9400\n\nC9422- PIN1 PP2V7_NAND_VCC 4.8V\n\nSSD_BOOT_LB_L 1.62V\nSSD_PWR_EN_LB_L 0V\nSTORAGE_LB_EN 3.05V\nSSD_RESET_LB_L 3.05V\nSSD_PCIE_CLKREQ_LB_L 3.18V\nLPSR_EN_LB_L 3.05\n\nat R9420 P2V7NAND_EN and PICCOLO_VEN1 are 0V"
