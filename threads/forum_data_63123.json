When powered on it display the question mark. Seller says that it simply stop working one day, no liquid spill, failed update or so. It can operate perfectly installing MacOs on external drive, but internal SSD storage does not show up in online recovery nor when external hard drive is plugged it to launch MacOs.\n\nI decided to open it and try to resolve the problem. Never been opened or worked before for sure.\n\nInspecting the board under the microscope show this two little spot of corrosion:\n\nprobe point TP[1]<SIGNAL>TP_Q3100_DRAIN</SIGNAL> , picture show before and after cleaning\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60796[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60797[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60798[/ATTACH]\nand LB300\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60799[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60800[/ATTACH]\nI can't find any other spot or phisical damage on this board. \n\nJ9600 (lifeboat port) also look good. \n\nI can confirm <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> ACE controller works fine, it does negotiate the 20V and I can boot up and charge the battery.\n\nAs mentionend many times as possible trouble point, <RESISTOR>R9350</RESISTOR> related to <SIGNAL>PPVIN_2V7NAND_LB</SIGNAL> measures 13.8V in both test point and pin1 and 1.58V on pin 2.\n\nI'm not so good looking at schematics as this is not my work, just hobby for myself. I made those measurement taking a cue on other posts, so please forgive me if I'm completely wrong.
