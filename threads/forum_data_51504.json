Mac starts spinning, turns off, then keeps spinning. I have all voltages going down to DDR 1.2v and CPU 1.05 and 1.8v, on display voltage only get 6v and then starts to drop, I have no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_R</SIGNAL> and no <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL> but I do have 3.3v S5 on VIN at <CHIP>U8300</CHIP>. Mouse lights up. Ideas? I have tried another working LCD, same."
