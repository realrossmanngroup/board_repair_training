This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",

This 4v9 rail hit <SIGNAL>PP1V8_AWAKE</SIGNAL> through <CAPACITOR>C7790</CAPACITOR> next to it.  That runs to <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> so I am sure that chip is gone.  It also runs to ROMs and a bunch of other stuff.    The only donor I have for this board I fixed so I don't want to start harvesting.   There could be 7 other chips plus <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> affected.     I am just going to shelf this board for a rainy day when I have donors for it.\n\nThe liquid so so hard to find I missed it the first time around.  This board taught me allot about how these new boards function.  It was well worth the experience.\n\nI hope this information helps someone.\n\nCheers."
