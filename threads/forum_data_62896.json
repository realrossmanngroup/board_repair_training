Battery don't charge, and when battery is plug, charger light turn green and orange randomly.\n\nNo water damage or other damage visible in the board. I also try another trackpad, same problem and booting another High Sierra from USB, to see if the problem was the OS.\n\nCan it be SMC failure, should I reball it or change it? or is something else?"
