The PMIC does not appear to have been hit, so I'm guessing this is a logical issue elsewhere? I skipped testing PMU_ONOFF_L because that's going to be a PITA with my equipment, but can do so if it's particularly relevant.\n\nLiquid damage was quite light, tested all affected caps, no shorts, and no passives were even damaged severely enough to need replacement.\n\nWhat should I do from here?"}
