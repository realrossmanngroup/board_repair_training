Fan spins high after awhile.[\/PLAIN]\n\nNot really sure where to start with this one.\n\nEverything around U5701 looks okay. It's interesting that the kb, tp AND sensor aren't working so makes me think it's layer one to jacks. Everything looks clean though.\n\nPRM reset did nothing (just tried it after it worked the other day)\nPowerbutton keyboard doesn't work.\n\nExternal keyboard and mouse are fine."}
