    "definitions": {
        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U9000": "What is U9000? a CHIP.",
        "U9701": "What is U9701? a CHIP.",
        "R9731V": "What is R9731V? a RESISTOR.",
        "PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT is the voltage rail for the backlight of the LCD screen. .",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "R0910": "What is R0910? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. ."
