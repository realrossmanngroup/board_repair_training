The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely.

            "message": "Customer came in with a 15 inch 2011 pro last week that he somehow ripped the fan connectors off of the board on. The GPU fan connector came off in a way that the pads were safe, so that one was a pretty simple process to solder back in place. The CPU fan on the other hand... Two of the pads were ripped off of the board. Pins 1 and 4 were taken to the shadow realm, never to be seen again, and having seen enough yugioh, I knew that the only way to fix this was finding another source for both of the pins. Thankfully pin 4 was ground, so that was easy enough to find another place to solder to. Pins 2/3 were hardwired to their pads, and I wound up scratching through the PCB right next to where pin 1 was ripped off and used that as the new 5v source (although I guess it's the exact same source considering it's the same trace that lead to that pad...)\n\nAny way, that all went fine and everything was in place. Turned the computer on and nothing blew up or started on fire, but the CPU fan was constantly running at full speed. The GPU fan is perfectly fine. I'm not getting a kernel panic, and the CPU usage is still seemingly fine, so aside from it being a little annoying, no functionality is lost to my knowledge.\n\nI ran the ASD test and it showed that the fan sensor was reading \"low\", and that there was an SMC I/O problem or something of that sort. I'm assuming whatever is supposed to read back from the fan is damaged past the 3rd pin (which i'm \"pretty\" sure is the one showing how fast it's going?)\n\nSo yeah, i'm pretty much stuck at this point. \n\nAnother weird thing is that the keyboard seems to be going in and out, and the trackpad completely doesn't work (besides click obviously). On the keyboard I can put caps lock on and i'll see the green light come up, then turn right off. If I hold it down, the light just blinks. It's unusable past that. No clue if that's related to this at all. I've cleaned the keyboard connector, and to my knowledge there hasn't been any spills on this computer. The power button works consistently, so i'm pretty sure the keyboard itself isn't damaged...\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!"

I didn't know that a square around something in the board view meant it was a component. I was actually missing <RESISTOR>R5665</RESISTOR>. The two pads under it were in such good condition that I thought it was just two empty places that were irrelevant, so I overlooked them. I kept testing for continuity between the pin right above it and the pad near the SMC. I checked the board thing again and saw I was up one point too high, tried the correct one and got continuity, which sucked because that connecting being broken was pretty much the only possible reason for it not working in my head at that point. After that I somehow wound up getting a burst of \"slightly less stupid\" and decided to check what that was going to and realized that literally the only problem was that <RESISTOR>R5665</RESISTOR> was a component (that happened to be missing) and not just two unused pads... Took <RESISTOR>R5665</RESISTOR> from another board, put it on and now it works just fine :[)\n\nNow that the fan problem is out of the way, I still have the issue of the keyboard and trackpad. I'm getting absolutely no movement from the cursor, and the keyboard seems to be connecting and disconnecting at a set speed. I even went in to the settings thing and saw it coming in and out.
