I only have schematcs for the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00138</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> but they layout doesnt match. Is there anything similar to <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00138</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A that I can use? I need to know the board layout faround <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>, have a burned pin and I expect its 5V line but not sure so its kinda risky to try and fix."
