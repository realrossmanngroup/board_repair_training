The wifi chip had been on fire so I pulled it and cleaned the area. After that it starts but obviously wifi is not working at the moment. And it is also missing backlight and I do not think this is related to the affected area, but I don't know as I can not find any schematics for this one...\n\nCan someone help with identifying the missing parts on the pictures? And anyone have knowledge of the backlight circuit in these ones ?\n\nThanks"}

Backlight circuit is similar to the 4924 boards, got to trace it out yourself."}

This is now working. The WiFi thing is just Apple bullshit ..."}

You may get away if you get one from a donor, a new one will probably not work."}

Thanks. I probably leave it like it is. They can use a USB WiFi adapter hanging out as a reminder not keeping any water near by."}
