Sometimes when I get a machine with good backlight circuit, only with 0V on PWM, it starts working after I turn it on with SMC bypass (SMC\/PRAM reset is not enough) and once it lights up, then it's fixed even when you normally turn it on without bypass. Had one 820-3330 (the same backlight circuit as 2915) with this issue just yesterday..."
