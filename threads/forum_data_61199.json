I am a new member and this is my first post!\nI have a A1708 in for liquid damage.\nCorrosion near BL circuit small spec on a cd3215.\n\nChanged both CD3215s and now have 20V 0.49A 384-390 mAh. mAh seem to be raising from 384-39and so on very slowly as I write this.\nCaps lock doesn\u2019t work, fan spins for less than a minute then shuts off. CPU gets warm\/hot.\n\nI have 13V on ppbhsg3h.\nmAh is now 401..\n\nCPUVR_SW1 is 0.947V\nCPUVR_SW2 is 0948V\nPPVCCCPU_S0G_PH1 is  0.942V PH2 is 0.943V\ndevice is now at 20.1V 0.53A and 429 mAh, CPU is pretty hot.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where to go from here any help is appreciated thank you."}
