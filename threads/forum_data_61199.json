I am a new member and this is my first post!\nI have a <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> in for liquid damage.\nCorrosion near BL circuit small spec on a <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>.\n\nChanged both CD3215s and now have 20V 0.49A 384-390 mAh. mAh seem to be raising from 384-39and so on very slowly as I write this.\nCaps lock doesn’t work, fan spins for less than a minute then shuts off. CPU gets warm/hot.\n\nI have 13V on ppbhsg3h.\nmAh is now 401..\n\n<SIGNAL>CPUVR_SW1</SIGNAL> is 0.947V\n<SIGNAL>CPUVR_SW2</SIGNAL> is 0948V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCCPU_S0G_PH1</SIGNAL> is  0.942V PH2 is 0.943V\ndevice is now at 20.1V 0.53A and 429 mAh, CPU is pretty hot.\n\nI’m not sure where to go from here any help is appreciated thank you."
