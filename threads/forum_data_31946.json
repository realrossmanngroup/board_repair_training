            "message": "Hi guys i managed to get one of these in my store water damaged. Of course upon inspection the water damage was near and around the <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> which is our same as older models tps chip. Checking around  that area i noticed that 5vs5 is missing so i checked for shorts none are present. I checked for my <SIGNAL>PP5VXX_EN</SIGNAL> this signal is missing, which comes from <SIGNAL>PM_EN_P5VS5</SIGNAL>. This signal comes from <CHIP>U7890</CHIP> that seems to be a logic gate, so on the <CHIP>U7890</CHIP> i'm missing <SIGNAL>PMIC_EN_P3V3S5</SIGNAL> that comes from <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> the aka PMIC chip which is a bga. So my question is this shit has many input signals. is it possible that something else is not allowing this chip to output the 3v3s5 signal? I'm totally lost on this crap."
