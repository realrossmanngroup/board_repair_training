        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

When its not booting, i do get a green to orange led light from the charger, but no fan spin. Since i can't get it into s4 s3 state, i'm guessing there's nothing on <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> so i went and checked, there's nothing on both <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>. Now i'm confused that normally the PCH should be dead but since it does sometime boots up, I must be missing something. Where else should i be looking at or did i do something wrong?\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 8.52V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 15.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.36V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.27V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> 4.97v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> 0v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 3.28v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> 0.30v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> 3.28v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> fluctuating between 2V and 0.15V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> fluctuating between 1.43V and 0.19v\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> 0V\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> 0v\n\n\ncorrosion found\n<CHIP>U5810</CHIP> <CAPACITOR>C5812</CAPACITOR> <CAPACITOR>C5813</CAPACITOR>\n<CHIP>U3210</CHIP> pin 5 - <SIGNAL>S4_PWN_EN</SIGNAL>\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThe board was not liquid damaged, however I did found corrosion around <CHIP>U3210</CHIP> and <CHIP>U5810</CHIP>."
