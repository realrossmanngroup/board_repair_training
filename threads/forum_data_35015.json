When its not booting, i do get a green to orange led light from the charger, but no fan spin. Since i can't get it into s4 s3 state, i'm guessing there's nothing on pm_slp_s4_l so i went and checked, there's nothing on both pm_slp_s5_l and pm_slp_s4_l. Now i'm confused that normally the PCH should be dead but since it does sometime boots up, I must be missing something. Where else should i be looking at or did i do something wrong?\n\nppbus_g3h 8.52V\nppdcin_g3h 15.3V\npp3v42_g3h 3.36V\nppvrtc_g3h 3.27V\n\npp5v_s5 4.97v\npp5v_s4rs3 0v\n\npp3v3_s5 3.28v\npp3v3_s4 0.30v\npp3v3_sus 3.28v\npp3v3_s3 fluctuating between 2V and 0.15V\npp3v3_s0 fluctuating between 1.43V and 0.19v\n\n\npm_slp_s5_l 0V\npm_slp_s4_l 0v\n\n\ncorrosion found\nu5810 c5812 c5813\nu3210 pin 5 - s4_pwn_en\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThe board was not liquid damaged, however I did found corrosion around U3210 and U5810."}

Remove U3210 and clean it up. Board should power without it, jus no thunderbolt. Also check J6100 and U6100 area for corrosion. Pin 8 on U1950 is also infamous for corrosion."}
