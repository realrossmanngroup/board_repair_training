When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

The original repair was <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR> on <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> were out of spec.  \" not close to 10 ohms \".  Well it's back and they are bad once more.   I assume I have to replace <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> but wanted feed back from others out there.  I don't understand how <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> could fail like this.  The original repair lasted for three weeks before failing again.  I have measured both of these lines to ground and resistance is infinite."
