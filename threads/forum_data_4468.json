First 2 red diagnostics indicators (CPUA + CPUB) are always on (with \/ without the CPU board) BUT when the front panel board is disconnected - those 2 indicators turn off. When DIAG LED button is pressed only 5V STBY turns on. PSU was replaced and tested. Any ideas?\nThanks."}

I have no idea how to help you, sorry. Only quick thing to test is the USB port data lines to see if the south bridge is dead."}
