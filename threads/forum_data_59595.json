        "message":"Hello All,\n\nFirst time poster and first board repair (Beyond removing surface corrosion!) so be kind :) \n\nI have a client board brought in for water damage.\n\nHe's had it in the cupboard for about 6 months because Apple said it's stuffed. \n\nThere was some minor corrosion around the U1845 chip which seems to be part of the CPU - JTAG isolation circuit so I don't know how vital that is. `\n\n--\nWe get\n\nGreen light on charger\n27m amp draw (possibly 25 I don't know how accurate my supply is)\n\nI measured the following, (I have included what I was near in case I'm looking in the wrong place)\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]Rail[\/TD]\n[TD]Result[\/TD]\n[TD]Enable?[\/TD]\n[TD]Near Chip[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPV5_S5[\/TD]\n[TD]0.5 V[\/TD]\n[TD]1mv[\/TD]\n[TD]U8100[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPV5_S4 (FETR)[\/TD]\n[TD]2.8mv[\/TD]\n[TD]0.4mv[\/TD]\n[TD]U8100[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPV5_S3[\/TD]\n[TD]3.29v[\/TD]\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPV5_S0[\/TD]\n[TD]17mv[\/TD]\n[TD]0.5mv[\/TD]\n[TD]U8030[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPBUS_G3HOT[\/TD]\n[TD]I assume works \"[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59309[\/ATTACH]\"\n:D[\/TD]\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]\n\n\nI must admit I lashed out on all the \"toys\" as part of a government stimulus - pre EOFY binge so I have the Union Repair thermal camera (already helped me fix an SSD!) and I can see no \"hot spots\"\n\nI have also Ultrasonic cleaned the board, however I do have photos of the original areas of damage. \n\n\n\nGeneral advice as to how to go about diagnosis as well as specific criticism on this repair is welcome.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJames"
