I tried searching the forum for the answer to this question.\n\nI have an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1932</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> board and tried what I thought 3 x CD3217B12 which have come from various board in the past (not sure which model) and none of them are behaving properly.\n\nAlso I've a stencil for this component but i'm not sure if it's producing the correct size solder balls. Written on the stencil is 0.12mm but after watching a few You Tube clips I've notice people are using 0.3mm balls. Which is correct?."
