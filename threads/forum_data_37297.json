Fan spins up, Audible Chime, Backlight all working.  I've done a pretty complete examination of the board, top & bottom.  Checked Traces, grounds good (solid), have some spots that look pretty crappy (without scope), simple continuity check seems good.  Those nasty traces still get continuity & nominal voltage, and I can get grounds I've tested with solid tone?  I'm kinda bugging out with the amount of \"Time Suck\" this single board\/machine is costing me.  \n\nSo I'm gonna take a chance that my $30 will get me some kind of hint?  Seems like I've got good PP to the display rail?  Am I missing something obvious, or should I just same my time & board swap it?  I'm at (the better part of..) 90min's right now (not counting typing time).  Just over my Bench Fee quoted time, but, don't want to make this a \"Rabbit Hole\".  Any Ideas?\n\nI'll try to post some board shot's in the AM.\n\nThanks,\nJohn"}

If not then start there. Don\u2019t diagnose the board before you are 100% sure it is a board issue. It could also just be a bad lcd-cable. If you don\u2019t have a known good display at hand then start with disconnecting internal display and see if an external one shows an image."}

First thing you did was it trying a known good display or was it to test with external screen while internal display disconnected ?"}
