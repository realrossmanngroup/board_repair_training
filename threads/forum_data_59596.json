Short is gone but still not turning on. \n\nCHecked all S5 rails and they all are ok.

When it is removed, board start normally, when i put back new or old <CHIP>U6300</CHIP> it doesnt turn on.\n\n\nAlso checked pin by pin if there is any short but only GND pins are shorted all other are ok. Will try with another new chip ( from donor) and back with answer.\n\n\nboth ic.s are  SSM3302  the only difference is that original is  SSM3302 A#309 and donor is  SSM3302  A#244 , does it matter?"
