            "message": "I've noticed it seems to be pretty random which boards have the heatsink with the heat pipe sensor in place, while they all have the connector for it. Does it matter if that sensor is present? If I have 10 boards that all came in with no heatsinks, and I have no clue which ones originally DID have the heatsink with the sensor attached, is it necessary to find out which ones had it? Or can I just install heatsinks without the sensor on all of them and call it a day? I don't do much work on these older boards, so haven't come across the issue much.\n\nAny help appreciated."
