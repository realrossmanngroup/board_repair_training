        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
