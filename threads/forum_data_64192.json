We live in Florida so the customer thinks lightning. \nAt first I thought the power supply was the issue, so I replaced this, I could hear the capacitors making a constant but quiet whining noise.\nNew power supply came in, this did not fix the issue. \nNext, I found a short on <CAPACITOR>C7845</CAPACITOR>, so I replaced this and the short was gone. While looking for the short, I noticed when I put alcohol in the area, the top right of chip <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> got extremley hot and would turn the alcohol to steam very quickly. \nSince I replaced the capacitor <CAPACITOR>C7845</CAPACITOR>, I do get the computer to power on, S0 is also present, I however get no video at all. \nThe diagnostic LEDS show 1, 2, are on, 3 is out, 4 is just barley lit, and 5 is off.

I get to step 4/4 and it gets about 35% of the way there, then you hear the fan spin super fast (seems like it may be restarting?), then I get the exact error every single time shown in the photo below.\nSSD dead?\nDid not check out the voltages on the coils for <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> yet. Gotta take it out of the iMac.\nOh, I also removed the CMOS battery on the back of the board because it was 2.8v. I wouldn't think this would make a difference would it? I got another battery coming in tomorrow."
