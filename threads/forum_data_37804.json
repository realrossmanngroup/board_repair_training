            "message": "Hi, working on an Macbook pro 15 Retina ( 2012 ), the computer works perfectly, but if i put to geekbench or other benchmarking software, the multicore score is low (average for that model is arroud 10000 but it only performs like 5k, the single core is correct.\nThe other problem is that the CPU temperatures is instable, i  can work for like half an hour and its all perfect, but sometimes it starts to raise fan speed and with some software to measure temperatures, it raises like 20 30ºC in 1 second and goes back to normal and when this happen, the cpu reachs to 105ºC and starts throtling.\nSince is a common problem i already resolder the <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> but the results are the same. \nThe computer dont have any liquid damage, and of corse i try with fresh OS install and replace thermal paste.\nASD or AHT dont show any errors"
