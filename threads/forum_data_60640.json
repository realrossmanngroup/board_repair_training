Replaced everything affected by the spill. Now turns with caps light working but still nothing on the screen. There is a section of the board that has a broken trace from a 6 leg chip to a capacitor but cant find a schematic or boardview to see where it goes. External works.\n\nTried with a 820-00850 but backlight area is layed out different.\n\nAnybody know how to get a boardview for this?"}
