There is a section of the board that has a broken trace from a 6 leg chip to a capacitor but cant find a schematic or boardview to see where it goes. External works.\n\nTried with a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> but backlight area is layed out different.\n\nAnybody know how to get a boardview for this?"
