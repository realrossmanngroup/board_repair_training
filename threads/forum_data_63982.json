        "message":"Hello,\n\nI have a MacBook Air that does not charge. Amp meter showed 5 volts for both ports, 0 amps. Changed both Type C chips and now we get 20 volts and 0.28-0.32 amps. It turns the computer on, but does not charge the battery. Tried new battery and it is still not charging.\n\nAny advice? Thanks!"

Super unfortunate considering the MacBook turns on and works fine with a charged battery. Is it possible that something else is causing the M1 to short this specific line down? These two data lines go to BC3 and BC2 on the M1 chip. Just below is BB2 which is I2C_SMC_UPC_SDA (0.300 on diode) and it connects to the two CD3217 chips that had to be replaced earlier."
