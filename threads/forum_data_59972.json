I assume this is a voltage which should make the backlight turn on. The PWM rail to the backlight driver has 2.3V which is maybe low? I have too little experience to tell. Backlight driver faulty which makes for too little boost and just not a high enough voltage?"}

But I can see from the partially yellowish tin that the board itself is refurbished. Also the GPU has been disabled. The costumer changed his mind and does not want to continue the repair. Thanks for the help, at least learned another thing about the PWM :)"}
