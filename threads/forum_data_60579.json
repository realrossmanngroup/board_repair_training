The SMC gives it a second try.   after that it settles at 0.030A and just sits there.\nthe 5V rail and 3V rails come up but the 3V3 rail stays up.\n\nAll rails enter S0.  All sys PWR Good is present about .2 seconds.\nAll rails have normal resistance to ground.\n\nNo signs of water.   Power washed under BGA packages as a last effort.\nBios is loading.  CPU is not booting and accessing RAM.   Only <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> lights up for a brief second on thermal.  Which is totally normal for this.\nThermal shows no shorts.  \"none I can see\".\n\nWhat should I check next?  How do you trouble shoot bounces like this?"
