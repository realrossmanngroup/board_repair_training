        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

            "message": "So a little bit of history on this one - originally came in with a spill - was mainly focussed around the clock chip and bios chip. I've removed both clock chip and bios chip cleaned it all up and then given it a new clock chip and fixed any oxidised pads underneath each. I've then ultrasonic'd the board dried it off and tested - all working, reassembled the macbook given it back to customer. Now two weeks later it's come back for warranty service as it wont turn on - checked the board again cannot see anything obvious other than a low <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> voltage - 2.4V instead of the 3.3 i would expect and also reading a lower resistance to ground than I would expect (Around 0.5kohm). So given I cannot see anything visible I once again ultrasonic'd the board dried it off and it starts working again. The next day however it has stopped working again! \nPresently have 2.5V on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL>\n\nAnyone have any thoughts on where the issue could lie?"
