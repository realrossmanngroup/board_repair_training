Battery replaced, same issue.\nIt had battery replaced a few months ago.\nIt will sometimes not power on and missing PP5V_S0.\n\n99% of the time when it's on and no display, it will have all the voltages present from Power Aliases, but not the LCDBKLT Rail.\nTested on external and a good working screen, no display.\nNo USB activity.\nPlease, any idea where I should check next?\nThanks"}
