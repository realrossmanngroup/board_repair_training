There wasnt any sign of prior repair attempt.\n\nHaving said that the GPU could still be the culprit as both of you mentioned.\n\nI am just trying to see what I can do on this. I actually tried to experiment on a 820-2101A (the 2007 model) where I removed the GPU and the board will still boot and chime with USB activities etc.\n\nIs there a way I can isolate the GPU or disable the GPU in some way [without removing it] and see if the board is still ok otherwise?"}
