Replaced it and found a short on PP3V42_G3H - caused by the SMC.\nSo I replaced the SMC, short is gone but the board stucks in S5 - missing  PP5V_S4RS3,  PP3V3_S4 and  PM_SLP_S4_L.\nG3H rails look fine.\n\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN: 3.43V,\nPM_BATLOW_L: 3.35V,\nPM_SLP_SUS_L: missing,\nPP_3V3_SUS: missing,\nPM_RSMRST_L: missing,\nPM_PWRBTN_L: 3.43V\n\nBest regards"
