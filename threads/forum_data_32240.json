It was missing PPBUS_G3H (0v). After replacing ISL6259 I was able to get a dim green light but still no power.  PPBUS_G3H is still missing. any suggestions? Im stuck\n\nThanks,"}

I got correct reading after replacing the current sense resistors. \n\nR7005 was bad. I was only getting 1.73v on CHGR_DCIN. I replaced it with a donor and got a working macbook\n\nYou can close this post. Thanks!"}
