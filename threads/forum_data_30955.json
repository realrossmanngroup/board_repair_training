            "message": "This one has me weirded out. Came in with liquid damage to the back of the board and JTAG connector. Removed JTAG and repaired the ALLSYS area <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> and resistors near it etc. The board gets a green light and no fan spin if the I/O Cable is attached. HOWEVER, if I unplug the I/O cable, I don't get a green light, but I DO get fan spin and the computer boots up. The internal cable had a red indicator, so I tried my known good I/O cables to see if any change, and I STILL get no fan spin but a green light that turns orange. I tried with multiple known good DC in boards and cables, and I still get the same issue. I inspected J9500 but it looks absolutely clean as can be. \n\nA little history on this board: the board was liquid damaged but the front side of the board was completely clean. The backside looked perfect from about the BIOS chip to the right including the SMC area. The left side left a lot to be desired <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> and ALL SYS are especially. Could this be an issue with crap under the CPU/SMC or anything like that or where do I begin?"

To recap: WITH the battery plugged in I get a green light and a fan spin but it only shows a battery charging icon in the middle of the display (does recognize there is a charger). However, the battery has not charged at all and has yet to power on the device fully. The charger alone doesn't do anything. I'm guessing that would mean the ISL is dead?\n\nEdit: Finally turned on but battery took a LONG time to get any charge."
