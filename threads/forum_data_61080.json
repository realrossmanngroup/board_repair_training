I check for shorts/diode reading on all 4 <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s all were around the ,400 mark. I checked the ldos from all 4 and all are present except <SIGNAL>LDO_BMC</SIGNAL> 1.1v  on <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>.\n<SIGNAL>3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is present.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 0v diode reading  .395.\nIm not sure where to look next as I cannot find any obvious shorts.\n\n\n\n--Just read a thread there similar. Going to replace both <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>/3100 and see."
