            "message": "board has garbage distorted screen due to vram issue. Reflowed vram and screen come back OK. Backlight is OK.\n\nwhen close lid, the machine will go to sleep, but screen wont come back when lid is open. Actually there are stuff displayed on the screen and can be seen when shine light from apple logo on the back. Just that backlight remained off.\n\nSame thing happen if I click on \"sleep\", it will wake without backlight. \n\nOnly when force restart backlight will come back on. I also used magnet to test the lid sensor around the edge when the lid is open, with the light shining from the back, I can see the display toggle on and off when I move the magnet.\n\n[additional info: However, display turned off due to inactivity after 1 minute will come back with backlight on]"
