        "message":"Clean board, had some work done near keyboard connector somewhere else, checked all that work and everything is fine.\n\nProblem is that when board is connected to power for first time it tries to turn on but shuts down right away, board will start fine after pressing and holding power button or shorting SMC_ONOFF_L for a few seconds usually more than 5 seconds, even then not all the time it starts but most of the times it will.\n\nSo far I have tried clean ME BIOS, new SMC, new U7100 and new U5110 but same exact thing.\n\nU5110 Pin 1-3 3.3v pin 5 3.3v\n\nPPBUS when board is off 12.56v\n\nDiode mode on SMC_ONOFF_L is on par with working board, same with pins 1-3-5 of U5110 all measure fine"
