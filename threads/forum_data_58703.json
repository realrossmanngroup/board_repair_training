        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",

        "U7820": "What is U7820? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

        "PP1V8_S3": "What is PP1V8_S3? The PP1V8_S3 signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides a voltage of 1.8 volts during the S3 power state. The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",
        "P5VS0_EN": "What is P5VS0_EN? This signal enables the PP5V_S0 power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "P1V8S3_PGOOD": "What is P1V8S3_PGOOD? P1V8S3_PGOOD is a signal that denotes that the PP1V8_S3 power rail is working..",

            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>\n\nThe Logic Board does not turn on, when attached to my power supply it will take 30Mah, then quickly 19Mah, then to about 160 for a split second, then back to 30. I have narrowed down the problem to <CHIP>U8080</CHIP>, and the <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4R3</SIGNAL> rail. It seems like there is a short to ground, however I have checked every connection to this and there is no short. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4R3</SIGNAL> will go to 0V, then to about 2V for a split second (when it goes it 160 mAH). When I remove <CHIP>U8080</CHIP>, this goes away, and the board stays at 160mah, when removed I checked every connection and no short.\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> will sometimes be there, it has occurred twice now where when I measure <RESISTOR>R8116</RESISTOR>, and others around it, the board will be OK, and even when <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> is there the logic board goes to 160mAH.\n\nI can compare the symptoms to Louis Rossmanns <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> video, where the S4 and S3 rails are affected by this.\n\nI have replaced <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> twice, and have replaced <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> too.\n\nEDIT: When removing <CHIP>U8080</CHIP>, <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4</SIGNAL> is present and working. As well as <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4R3</SIGNAL>, and <SIGNAL>P5VS0_EN</SIGNAL> (However it is at 3V, is this normal?)\n\nEDIT: Got it working, however not fully, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4R3</SIGNAL> is good, however <CHIP>U7820</CHIP> is not outputting <SIGNAL>P1V8S3_PGOOD</SIGNAL>. All voltages are present too, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> (3.3V), <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S3</SIGNAL> (3V), <SIGNAL>P1V8S3_FB</SIGNAL> (0.8V) , <SIGNAL>P1V8S3_SW</SIGNAL>, (1.8V)"
