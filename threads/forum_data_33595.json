Its been driving me mad for the long time and i cant figure it out so decided to ask you guys some help. its been a pain and i know that it might be a dead video but i believe i can still fix it. Right so the problem is that macbooks starts as it should, chimes ok, but theres no backlight or video.i have checked all power rails and all power rails are pretty much ok. GPU vcore and cpuvcore both present. i have noticed that <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> starts with 1.05v with fans spinning but after fans starts to spin faster voltage drops to 0.89v . is it normal or needs to be investigated? Also came accross that <SIGNAL>GFXIMVP_ISNS_IOUT</SIGNAL>=<SIGNAL>SMC_GFX_ISENSE</SIGNAL> only 0.01V. anyway any suggestions where to start? <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_FUSED</SIGNAL> power stops at <TRANSISTOR>Q9806</TRANSISTOR> pin4. 0V pin 1.2.5.6. <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> -0V. \nL9000 - 0V both sides. <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> 0.01V .Changed <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> no change. really desperate for some help or where to start."
