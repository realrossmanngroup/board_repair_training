I get 20v when and the amps go to 0.099 go back down to 0 ans stays like that. I noticed once it went to 0.300 and that was it. No short circuits or components found and no liquid damage, no burned parts and the laptop it's in perfect condition.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> -5v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3S</SIGNAL> - 3v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> - 1.8v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.3v\n\nAny suggestions would be good :) I have couple of days to fix this one, then client goes abroad.\n\nThanks"
