F3050 is good and the voltage is present there. The USB-C port\/cable is new.\nAm i correct in thinking U3100 is that uses the power_gate_enable line to gate q3100? following that would lead me to PP3V3R3V0_AON\n\nPP3V3R3V0_AON Is not present when just the charger is plugged in. \nMy other concern is that i am missing pp1v2_S5SW completely. \n\n(not present when on battery or with the charger plugged in.)"}

With the battery connected i can see ppBUS_G3H slowly rising from 6.90V\nit is currently now at 6.95V so it seems to be charging the battery. \n\nIt will not run of the charger alone though, This is all a really weird change in symtom considering all i did was pull and test two resistors.

Had that issue on an alienware SIO chip once. Only ever came back to life after an ultrasonic clean. Im using Amtech 4300 (i find as its water soluble it cleans better)\n\nAnyhow, i cant seem to measure things around the PMIC without slipping and buggering the PMIC so i have to order some PMIC's from china before i can report back- If im lucky it may even fix it.\nI also have an 820-0045 a1534 board with a shorted PMIC that had simalar issues (not recognising USB C and not charging but running off the battery) So with any luck ill be able to get that one going as well :).\n\nHorrible little chips to pull and site clean though.\n\nEDITL removed PMIC, shorts not gone, injected voltage. Dead SMC. As far as i know there are no parts boards for the a1534 yet?"}
