F3050 is good and the voltage is present there. The USB-C port/cable is new.\nAm i correct in thinking <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> is that uses the <SIGNAL>POWER_GATE_ENABLE</SIGNAL> line to gate <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR>? following that would lead me to <SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL>\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL> Is not present when just the charger is plugged in. \nMy other concern is that i am missing <SIGNAL>PP1V2_S5SW</SIGNAL> completely. \n\n(not present when on battery or with the charger plugged in.)"
