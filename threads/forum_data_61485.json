Caps C4810-18 where good but i changed them all anyway. Now i see that values on pins 22 and 23 are not correct (1,6 V each) and in the working board are 0 and 3,4V). The come directly from the SMC. I already change it in the past but i change it another time and i'am sure i see for a while 3.4V on pin 23 but now they go back to incorrect values. These signals are generated somewhere or what ? Because they are direcly connected to SMC and go nowhere else....\nI also check the values of these pins directly near the SMC and not only on the SSD connector : are the same. Pins are not shorted and impedance is correct for each."}
