Green light goes to orange and the fan spins but it docent chime neither post anything. This device is liquid damaged. Replaced a lot of components near SMC, before that it did not even turn on. Well it did but there were no green light neither orange. Checked the is cpu turned on and it was correct amount as in schematic is written."

I can check those clock signal areas if there is some corrosion but i found out that the most parts that had corrosion on them was <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>. \n\nI'm glad that you help and i'm really thankful for it, but i just were wondering that it doesn't help neither doesn't speed my answering your question, but if you like do it its fine with me. :D And I'm not mad at all, i wouldn't  get mad about something so silly.
