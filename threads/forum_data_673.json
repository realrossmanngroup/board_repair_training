Green light goes to orange and the fan spins but it docent chime neither post anything. This device is liquid damaged. Replaced a lot of components near SMC, before that it did not even turn on. Well it did but there were no green light neither orange. Checked the is cpu turned on and it was correct amount as in schematic is written."}

Do you get a light on a USB mouse? I know, who the hell has a wired mouse anymore, but find one! I go running to the camera DVR everytime I have to do this because it is the only wired optical mouse left in the store."}

I can check those clock signal areas if there is some corrosion but i found out that the most parts that had corrosion on them was PP3V42_G3H. \n\nI'm glad that you help and i'm really thankful for it, but i just were wondering that it doesn't help neither doesn't speed my answering your question, but if you like do it its fine with me. :D And I'm not mad at all, i wouldn't  get mad about something so silly. Anyways lets find out what is the real problem with my Macbook Air."}
