    "definitions": {
        "820-00164": "What is 820-00164? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",
        "D7005": "What is D7005? a DIODE."

            "message": "Ok, so I feel stupid for asking but I am not sure what happened. I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00164</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that had a bunch of back light and LCD connector liquid damage. Pins 2 &3 of the LCD connector were corroded off of the connector so I removed it an replaced with a new one. I had to pretty much replace everything around the <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> as well as the <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> because the ball under pin 5 was gone, as well as the pad. SO I replaced all of the caps and resistors with donors, ran a wire for a pad and re-soldered a new <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> and cleaned the area. the <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> had a couple of corroded parts that I replaced as well. the computer was working before the work except no back light and now I am not even getting a green/orange light on the charger. I am getting <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> but nothing else. Any clue where I should look? I'm pretty sure I put all of the components back for <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> but cannot figure out how or why I turned a working no back light board into dead. I admit I sat for a few minutes checking my soldering and it doesn't look like I bridged anything or have cold solder joints."

            "message": "Ok, so I am embarrassed. I found the problem. Pin 3 of <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> was broken off of the dual diode, it just looked like it was attached. I had touched the joints up previously It just didn't fall off yet. I started probing around and it lifted up a little with the broken leg still attached to the solder pad.  Replaced with donor and now board is running. Best of all, My back light soldering worked as I now have backlight! going to UC it and put it togerther. Thank you for your help and time. This forum is great. Regards,\n\nTim"
