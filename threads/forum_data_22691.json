        "message":"I received this machine from a customer that shows there is no wifi hardware installed. He doesn't think there was ever any liquid damage since he bought it from someone else. I haven't taken apart the board to inspect but he said he did an SMC reset and the wifi worked for a couple of hours then it went back saying no hardware installed. I believe this board has the wifi chip soldered onto it so I'm not sure how this could be happening. \nI tried an SMC reset and PRAM reset myself but that didn't bring it back.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar issue to this?"
