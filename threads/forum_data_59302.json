Unfortunately it had to be done. vbulletin had been messing with subscriptions for a while and even with patching the old forum was hacked into twice. I've been going back and forth with them since December and there is zero support from them, even if you spent $500 in old licenses and pay to host it on their cloud platform. I will be monitoring the forum with a developer to make sure it works smooth sailing going forward. Please email [email]forumhelp@rossmanngroup.com[\/email] if you are having any issues."
