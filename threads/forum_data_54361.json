All SYS PWRGD is present \"while it in the bounce\".  I cant find anything wrong with the ring of fire \"3V3 switches\"  I checked SMC Logic.\n\nSomething is shutting this machine down.  Does any one have input?\nI have posted a video on my channel if you want to see it in action.\n\n[URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdMvaAZr3Nw[/URL]\n\nI really hate boards like this!
