Drop, liquid damage, out of the blue? \n\nFirst thing is to try known good screen\/cable. because this is a board repair forum, I am going to make the assumption that you have already done that, and not suggest it(but if you haven't, I'm going to kick your ass). :D\n\nSecond thing to check is 3.3v on pin 2\/3 of LCD connector. Not 1v, not 1.5v, not 2.7v, but a full 3.3v.\n\nThird thing to check is that the little clock filter on the LVDS line is good. My favorite way to check if it is good is to just replace it since it takes less time to do that than to drive myself nuts.. but this machine is too \"new\" for that to go bad."

What if the PCH you bought was dead? What if it was something but the PCH? You invest an hour of your time and $30-$50 into a repair that may not even work, that's after investing thousands into a BGA machine and countless hours fucking with it to figure it out."
