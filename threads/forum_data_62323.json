No fan spin.\nUnit is in S3AC mode, per chart on schematic p.64 using [I]SMC_ADAPTER_EN[\/I], [I]SMC_PM_G2_EN[\/I][ABLE], and [I]SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN[\/I]\n\nSymptoms: \n1. Every [I]rareth [\/I]time, system comes up. shows battery as dead (big red battery icon), not charging.\nAll other times (virtually all), does not come up.\n2. One pin pair on the magsafe blew out-both sides black, some metal from the tip of the PS plug gone. Doesn't seem to have made a difference, except the 'other' pin on the PS plug isn't pogo any more (stuck).\n\npic of PS plug: \n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"177px\"]60419[\/ATTACH]\n\n...and the LB:\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"231px\"]60420[\/ATTACH]\n\nSteps:\n\nAll \"G3 Hot\" (Always-Present) rails OK.\nStarting on 5v:\n1. OK = PP5V_S5_LDO\n2. 0v = PP5_S5_FET mostly 0V, sometimes 5V after PS on a while!? ([I]@U8060 pin 5\/6[\/I])\n3. U8060:\npin 1\/3: 5v ([I]PP5V_S5_P5VS5FET [\/I][[I]PP5V_S4[\/I]])\npin 2: 0v ([I]P5VS4_EN [\/I]in)\n4. Tracing P5VS4_EN tp p.64 at C8192 = 0v\n5. Tracing back to U8170:\npin 6: 3.3v [I]irrelevant[\/I] (PP3V3_S5_PWRCTL = power for OR gate 8170 ([I]NOSTUFF[\/I]))\npin 2: 0v ([I]PM_SLP_S5_L[\/I]) per chart on same page, it is only HIGH when in modes S3, S3AC, and S0. This pin Low makes [I]P3V3S4_EN[\/I] low as well.\nHow to make PM_SLP_S5_L go Hi?\nPulled L by R1460 (p.13), Pulled H by U0500 (Broadwell) pin AP5 ([I]SLP_S5*[\/I]) on same page.\n\nSo, I'm stuck at the Broadwell :-(\nI was hoping to find out why we were stuck in S5 (even though p.64 table says in S3AC...)\n\nTIA!"

Checked the MOSFET \"BATLOW# ISOLATION\", nothing on any pin. \nGate signal comes from PP3V3_S4_TBT, and U3210 seems to be off, with both ENables (EN & HVEN) at 0V, and PP3V3_S4_TBTAPWRSW at 3.3V. \nThe magsafe LED goes from green to orange, and stays there. \nThe SSD is cool, like everything else on it.\nAm I right that the LB is stuck at S5?\nIt's been a week, and it stinks that I have no distinct signal symptom to chase yet... \n\nThanks again!"

I must not understand the signal.\n\nre: Progress:\n0. 820-4924-A p. 75\/sheet 58.\n1. I replaced TPS51980.\n2. When checking for solder bridges after, I had a short between pins 23 (VIN\/[B]PPVIN_S5_HS_OTHER3V3_ISNS[\/B])& 24 (DRVH\/[B]P3V3S5[\/B]\/[B]P3V3S5_TG[\/B]). Great! Too much solder...\n3. I pulled the new one off, and [I]the short was still there[\/I]!\n4. Here is the relationship between the 2 pins:\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60421[\/ATTACH]\n\n...and here is the MOSFET (Q7560\/FDMS3602S), just off to the right of the above image:\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60422[\/ATTACH]\nShould the Gate & Drain on this dual N-Channel be shorted? My instinct says [I]no[\/I]. And because the signal to pin 24 takes a direct path to\/from the MOSFET Gate, there are no alternate signal paths to short indicated. With TPS51980 removed, and on the pins of the MOSFET directly, Gate & Drain are shorted.\n\nThoughts?\n\nTIA!"
