I measured the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> line with a USB-C charger connected, and get around 1.08V (instead of 12V?). No short to ground in this line - resistance measures 1K ohms rapidly increasing to infinity.\n\nFuses F3000 and F3100 are both intact - I resistance tested them. However when I test for <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS</SIGNAL> (or the one for the other port) at either F3000 or F3100's terminals, I get zero volts at all. Measuring between ground and either of F3100 or F3000's terminals, I get a 22.8 ohm continuity. Is this a short to ground? How would I find this short? I see there are some adjacent capacitors, one of those?\n\nI probed for <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS</SIGNAL> at other adjacent points (including L3300 and L3400 solder pads - my board apparently never had these components) - no voltage at all.\nOther nearby voltage rails I probed: <SIGNAL>USBC_XA_CC2</SIGNAL> (and CC1 and CC1/<SIGNAL>2_CONN</SIGNAL>) fluctuating between 0.8 and 1.5V, <SIGNAL>SAVE_CC1A</SIGNAL> no voltage at all.\n\nAnyone know what's wrong?
