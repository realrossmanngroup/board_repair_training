        "message":"hey guys,\n\nThis one had no power\/no boot. Upon closer inspection i found some corrosion under the grey spongey type sticker next to battery connector. Once i peeled it away i noticed some corrosion and tested components to find short on one of the caps. it was corrosponding to pp_audio_ch and shorting to ground. I also lifted the U6400 and reballed just incase  there was any crap under there. All is well boots but no chime. \n\nI notice now pp3v42_g3h is measuring 3.50v??\nWhat is the best way to proceed. Thanks"
