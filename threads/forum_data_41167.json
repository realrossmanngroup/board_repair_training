            "message": "hey guys,\n\nThis one had no power/no boot. Upon closer inspection i found some corrosion under the grey spongey type sticker next to battery connector. Once i peeled it away i noticed some corrosion and tested components to find short on one of the caps. it was corrosponding to <SIGNAL>PP_AUDIO_CH</SIGNAL> and shorting to ground. I also lifted the <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> and reballed just incase  there was any crap under there. All is well boots but no chime. \n\nI notice now <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is measuring 3.50v??\nWhat is the best way to proceed. Thanks"
