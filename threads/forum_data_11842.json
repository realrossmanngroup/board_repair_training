This one was repaired by someone in the past - that' all I know about its history - also it seems it was LD at that time without serious signs of corrosion.\n\nI can measure power to all coils except L3095 (TB), the CPU gets hot (it also does the macbook-air thing - it turns on-off-on as it should) but there is no chime, no image, no green light.\n\nI also noticed U3210 (also TB) has been replaced or re-soldered in the past.\n\nAny clues?\n\nAlready tried different I\/O-power board.\n\n\nthanks in advance guys."}

So it was probably not necessary :) _I just learned not to fully trust my oscilloscope Vavg readings.\n\nSince I have no green light I looked for SYS_ONEWIRE and found it on a pad south of the SMC. I measured that and it jumps all over the place! few mV to 1.5V to 3.4V to 700mV... is that a clue that the SMC could use some flux+heat (since this macbook air was previously - dont know when - LD)?\n\nduke I dont wanna waste your time - let me know your final thoughts and we will probably call it a day.\n\nbr,\ngeorge"}
