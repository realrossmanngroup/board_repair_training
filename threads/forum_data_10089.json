(Very little corrosion)\nDid some work on it: \n<RESISTOR>R5095</RESISTOR> pad nr.2 was distroyed so I connected it to <RESISTOR>R5092</RESISTOR>. This worked, the machine would work for a day then it stopped working.\n\nHot rails are present. One wire circuit seems fine. Still no green green light. (only after I try the charger in another board and connect it back then I can get a green light one time).\nSuspected the SMC (after watching some Luis videos). I did reflow the SMC. Still nothing.\nAny advice?"
