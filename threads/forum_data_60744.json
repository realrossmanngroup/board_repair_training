Clean up the corrosion and replaced any corroded components, but still not powering up. What i get is two pulses on PP5V_S4, and even ALL_SYS_PWRGD at initial point of connecting the MagSafe. \n\nNo activity on smc bypass.\n\nPM_BATLOW_L 3.3V\nPM_RSMRST_L 3.3V\nPM_PWRBTN_L 3.4V\nSMC_ONOFF_L 3.4V\n\nAttempted triggering SMC_ONOFF_L while checking PM_PWRBTN_L and PM_PWRBTN_L doesn't change. Remains at 3.4v. \n\nAny suggestions"}
