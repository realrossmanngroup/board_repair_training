            "message": "Working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that I've already spent an hour on fixing various things. The only issue left is that Thunderbolt isn't working because the probe-point for pin 6 of <CHIP>U3220</CHIP> has eroded away completely, and it's part of a through-board trace. No biggie, I thought I'd just run a wire from pin 6 of <CHIP>U3220</CHIP> to <RESISTOR>R2885</RESISTOR> pin 2. I did this, and it still doesn't work. The trace on the probe-point for pin 6 is 100% gone. I can't even see any of the trace head to possibly attach a wire. <RESISTOR>R2885</RESISTOR> is the only other place on the board this signal appears, and it doesn't seem to work when I run a wire there.\n\nAm I out of luck on this one? Any other solutions that I'm not aware of? Any advice appreciated."
