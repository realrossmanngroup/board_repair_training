Geen light OK but no boot... I cleaned the keyboard connector and BOOM ! WORKING.\n\nThought that I was the new Louis Rossman (Biggest mistake ever!) I decided to look under the board the water damage and clean it with alcool. They were corrosion around U4600 and U3310.\nAnd guess what ? Still have green light, fan spining for 2 seconds and stop, no boot !\n\nNeed some advice to know where to start ...\nSorry for being such a newbe.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00e9my"}

I bet one of the SPI termination resistors\/traces is corroded or pin 8 on U1950. Look up u6100 and find all the termination resistors and check them and the traces between them."}
