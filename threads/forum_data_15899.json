WORKING.\n\nThought that I was the new Louis Rossman (Biggest mistake ever!) I decided to look under the board the water damage and clean it with alcool. They were corrosion around <CHIP>U4600</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3310</CHIP>.\nAnd guess what ? Still have green light, fan spining for 2 seconds and stop, no boot !\n\nNeed some advice to know where to start ...\nSorry for being such a newbe.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJérémy"

Look up <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> and find all the termination resistors and check them and the traces between them."
