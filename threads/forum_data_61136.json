The processors get hot and the fans run non stop.   Have to hold power button to shut it off and restart it.\n\nSensors are all reading normally.\nThe unit gets hot when it goes to sleep.   The CPU's get hot and the fans run.   It is like you are playing a video game while it is asleep.\n\nI have no idea on where to even start."}

The board is clean,  no history of liquid damage.  The problem is that it will not wake for sleep.  \nAlready replaced U9800,  SMC, PCH and still same problem.  \nIt will work if I turn off Automatic switching \/ energy\/ system pref.  So it will wake if run on the discrete GPU,  but will not wake if run on CPU.  \nI've check PM_SLP_S3 and  does not drops, stay 3.3V constant.\nI was thinking of replacing discrete GPU,  but it seems more of a Intel GPU side.  I'm not sure,  please help."}
