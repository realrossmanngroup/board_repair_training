            "message": "Hey Guys\n\nCame across this with liquid damage around Phase 1/2 chips <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7330</CHIP>. I don't have this schematic, but <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3787</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> seems to be as close as I can get.\nSeems like there is short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> ad I can feel quarter of <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> heating up.\nRemoved F7140/F7141 to isolate the short and seems like its on the CPU side.\n\nLifted L7320 and short is gone. So I was wondering have you guys seen these phase chips failing? Could I have dead CPU, especially with the liquid around this area?\n\nAlso, my hot air recently failed and I replaced it with doggy AOUYE 968 I had laying around. I am not sure if the hot air is weak or the area is shorting all to ground, but I cannot even get the solders to melt on this chip. Whole board gets hot but the bloody chip is not coming out.\nHave you experienced anything like this before? Planing to order this[URL='https://www.unionrepair.com/quick-881d-1300w-hot-air-desoldering-rework-station.html'] quick 881 1,3KW from unionrepair[/URL]. Is it still best for my buck?\n\nThanks"

            "message": "Thanks for your reply.\n\nLifted the mentioned coils and all three <RESISTOR>R7310</RESISTOR>/20/30 are giving 0.16ohm to ground. My Fluke's precision is 0.10ohm\n\nI don't have the same board however, I have <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3662</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> (without dedicated GPU) which turns on but have picture issues (overheated so much that heatsink support legs got desoldered from the board, not sure if CPU reflow can save it )\n\nIt seems to be having the same 3 phases and the same chips.\nI lift up the coils on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3662</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and measured at <RESISTOR>R7310</RESISTOR>/20/30 and got 16-17ohm. Would that mean dead CPU on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00426</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>?\n\nThanks for the tips, much appreciated."
