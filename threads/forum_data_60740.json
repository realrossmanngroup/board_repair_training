I have a 820-00281 that is not liquid damaged, and the board looks completely clean. When I connect the charger it goes to 20v .380a and just stays there. CPU and GPU voltage is not present but all the main rails seems to be fine. All_SYS_PWRGD is 3.22v. I compared diode mode values on all the big coils with a good board and they seem fine. Here are some of the voltages I have measured.\n\nALL_SYS_PWRGD  -  3.22\nSMC_DELAYED_PWRGD  -  3.41\nPM_PCH_SYS_PWROK  -  3.31\nLPC_PWRDWN_L  -  0\nPLT_RST_L  -  0\nCPU_VCCST_PWRGD  -  0.976\nCPU_VR_EN_R  -  3.22\nPPVCC_S0_CPU  -  0\nPM_DSW_PWRGD  -  3.41\nPM_PCH_PWROK  -  3.32\n\nL7030  -  12.66\nL8000  -  1.012\nL7960  -  0.964\nL7900  -  1.2\nL7600  -  5.14\nL7660  -  3.3\nL8410  -  0\nL7410  -  0\nL7420  -  0\nL7211  -  0\nL7221  -  0\nL7231  -  0\nL7330  -  1.053\nLA640  -  0\nLA650  -  0\nLA350  -  0\nLA300  -  0\nLB700  -  0\nL3500  -  0"}

I noticed after leaving the board connected to the charger for a few minutes, the PCH seems to get warm. The CPU does not feel warm at all. I have never replaced a chip of this size before. It it something that can be done using just the Quick 861DW or I will need some kind of rework station?"}

I replaced the PCH on this board but I still have the same exact symptoms, so I don't think it was a PCH issue. The new PCH also gets warm though, as if there is a short to ground somewhere. I can't seem to find any shorts. Could a bad CPU cause the PCH to heat up?"}
