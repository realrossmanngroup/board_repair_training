I need som help.\n\nA few days ago I received a 2012 MBP with a short circuit in the <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> line. the short was in the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>, replace it an the board turn on. I connect the screen and everything is fine.\nthe problem is <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.22 volts and the battery is not charging. I replace the ISL Again and no change. replace the SMC and no change.\nI need your help guys.\nthanks. sorry for my English."
