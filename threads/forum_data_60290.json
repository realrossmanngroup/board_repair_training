Removed the capacitor and others around it on PPBUS_G3H_CPU.  \n\nPPBUS_G3H_CPU is still shorting to ground with them removed but I can't locate the short anywhere. Its 0.000v on diode mode.\n\nI've tried a little voltage an some alcohol to see if anything is getting warm but no luck with that.\n\nAny ideas?"}
