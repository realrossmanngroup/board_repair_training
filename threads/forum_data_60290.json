Removed the capacitor and others around it on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H_CPU</SIGNAL>.  \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H_CPU</SIGNAL> is still shorting to ground with them removed but I can't locate the short anywhere. Its 0.000v on diode mode.\n\nI've tried a little voltage an some alcohol to see if anything is getting warm but no luck with that.\n\nAny ideas?"
