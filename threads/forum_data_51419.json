After that in OS not working, Already tried new keyboard, new trackpad, new flex. Not working. Trackpad is good because it works on other macbook. \n\nChecked pin by pin J5700 with all resistor and also changed <CHIP>U5700</CHIP> but still not working. I have no idea what more can i do. L5710 also is ok and has continuity."
