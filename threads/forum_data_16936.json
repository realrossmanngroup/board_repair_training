Tell them to send it to Apple to code better drivers, not to you. This has nothing to do with GPU function. They will say[I] \"it didn't do that before\"[\/I], but it didn't even work before."}

The bar is slightly diagonal and comprised of many colored lines. Ignore it and tell your customer to ignore it, too. It also happens after a reball in my experience."}
