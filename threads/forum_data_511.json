        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

            "message": "Let's cover two things.\n\n[B]Firstly[/B], 0.8v on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> usually means <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is missing. Without <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> going to the ISL, it will not produce more than 0.7v-0.8v. You have been measuring, probing around, and replacing chips powered by <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>. Is <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> still present? If it goes away, 0.7v-0.8v is what you get on <SIGNAL>CHGR_PHASE</SIGNAL>. \n\n[B]Secondly[/B], I think this is a good time to set a precedent here: this is the second time you've mentioned that. This isn't something I felt like making into a sticky or getting into too far, but it's something that will have to be discussed sooner or later, and this is a better time than any.\n\nIn the first page of the thread, duke helped you and you ignored his help, ignored his question, did something differently than what he asked, and complained that no one was helping you. Now, you have received a lot of help, but seem irritated that we did not reply again immediately.\n\nI can't speak for Duke, but I personally appreciate every single person who decided to give up their hard earned $29/month for the ability to receive advice from us. [B]Thank you very much, from the bottom of my heart, all of you, for doing that[/B]. Seriously, not trolling here; it is appreciated, and we will work our asses off to live up to that.\n\n[B]THAT BEING SAID [/B]:)\n\nI am more than happy to refund your money [I]early[/I] into your subscription if you feel this is not helpful. I do not want to foster an environment of people ignoring advice, doing the opposite of what we say, and then getting mad when it doesn't work out. Further, I do not want to set the precedent of there being an expectation that every single question will have [I]instant [/I]answers. Above all, I cannot set a precedent that every board is fixable. Many are fixable, but many are trash. I log into this place at least seven times a day, often from the gym, work, train, before I go to sleep... I can't be at a point where when I log in, I have to worry that people are angry that I haven't logged in enough. $29/month buys answers, but if I have to tell duke that he has to stop his BGA machine in the middle of a $500 repair to post here, I'm going to have to pay him considerably more money. He is a limited resource you will not find [I]anywhere else[/I][I]. [/I]The same goes for myself with this: If I have to jump out of a security system installation because someone is going to get mad that a brunch question was answered at lunchtime, then the rate is not going to be $29. More like $500.\n\nDuke and I are where we are because we spend 25 hours a day in front of these problems beating our head against the wall to figure them out, on systems that were never meant to be documented or troubleshooted by technicians. This is what makes us good at our job; please understand this. Please don't abuse this resource by throwing a fit if you do not receive an instant reply. \n\nIf you feel the need to do so, or if these terms do not make sense, I have no problem refunding you."
