He says he disconnected power from battery before putting on the new SSD. I tested the SSD on another machine and it works fine, so no shorted SSD. Removed the board and testing it alone on the bench only with charger plugged in. Board takes 20V but 0 amps. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is jumping up and down like crazy but has no short on it. Though, I could find some shorts. <SIGNAL>SSD_PWR_EN_CONN_L</SIGNAL> is shorted, also <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S5G</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP1V_S5G_REG</SIGNAL>. Tried lifting L8060 and even without it I cannot get steady <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. Anything else I can measure here?"

            "message": "Actually, when my bench PSU cannot supply sufficient current its display show 5.5amps being pulled with a voltage drop. For example, if I set it to 5V 5A and there's a short on the board, the amp meter from the PSU says 5.5A which is the maximum it can supply but the voltage indicator drops to less than 1V. This is not happening here on this specific board. If I set it to 1V to inject on those lines some of them pull 0.5A and on L8060 PIN2 it pulls around 1A but with no voltage drop. That's what's strange. It's behaving like I had no shorts on the board. I'll see the possibility of acquiring a more powerful PSU but I really think it would not help much here because as I told, the PSU is not \"cutting\" it's steady 1V and 1A"
