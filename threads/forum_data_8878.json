As though PRAM reset but after boot option or during boot\n\n\nThought maybe there is still a problem with SMC reset or thermal trip or the SMC itself.\nDon't want to just go pulling the SMC off willy-nilly.\nNot sure of how to check for on SMC reset.\nChecked <SIGNAL>CPU_THEMTRIP_3V3</SIGNAL>, is low when powered until reset then goes high. Can't tell what one is happening first, reset or high.\n\n\nAnything else it could be?\nWhat should I be looking for here please?"
