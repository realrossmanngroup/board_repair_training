I tried measuring all the components with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, and everywhere I get is 12.56 volts. Also on further measuring the power rails I found the following that <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> every component instead of showing 5V is showing Zero (0) volts. I presume that the problem is in the S3 power rails. On further troubleshooting I figured out that <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> chip the voltage on Pin 12 which is a S5 rail it should measure 3.3V but it only measures 1.295V. I presume that the <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> chip is bad. Again on further troubleshooting I found out that the <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> should have 5 volts but does not 5V. Am I correct in my troubleshooting steps. Correct me if I am wrong. Can anyone please advice what further steps is to be taken in order for me to make this board working. Thanks in advance."

You have to work with us here or this is impossible, and right now you are not thinking at all.\n\nYou said <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> is corroded. You can see on the schematic that <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> comes from <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>. You can also see on the schematic that <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> on page 7/8 is 3.3v. You get 0.4v on <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>.\n\nSo\n\n1) <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> is supposed to be 3.3v.\n2) <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> is 0.4v\n3) <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> creates <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>.\n4) <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> is corroded & rusted looking.\n\nI need for you to be able to take this information that we have brought to light and come to a conclusion. Even if it is wrong, some conclusion. If you can't do this, then stop until you can.\n\nAlso answer duke's question on whether <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is present, and what <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> voltage is."
