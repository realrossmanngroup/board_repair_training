I tried measuring all the components with PPBUS_G3H, and everywhere I get is 12.56 volts. Also on further measuring the power rails I found the following that PP5V_S3 every component instead of showing 5V is showing Zero (0) volts. I presume that the problem is in the S3 power rails. On further troubleshooting I figured out that U7200 chip the voltage on Pin 12 which is a S5 rail it should measure 3.3V but it only measures 1.295V. I presume that the U7200 chip is bad. Again on further troubleshooting I found out that the PP5V_S0 should have 5 volts but does not 5V. Am I correct in my troubleshooting steps. Correct me if I am wrong. Can anyone please advice what further steps is to be taken in order for me to make this board working. Thanks in advance."}

If i remove the probe the Fan stops. What does that indicate ? The Pin 5 is P3V3S5_VFB. It sometimes happens on Pin 6 as well.Please advice."}

This is what i did - I connected the logic board back into the computer connected all the cables including the LCD connector.  and then went ahead and touched the red probe to one of the pins 5 or 6 ( not sure ) and black probe to the ground.  The computer came one with a Chime.  So does this indicate that the U7200 is bad or is there something that i need to check.  Please advice as what should I do further.  Thanks in advance."}

I need for you to think. You have to work with us here or this is impossible, and right now you are not thinking at all.\n\nYou said U2800 is corroded. You can see on the schematic that PPVRTC_G3H comes from U2800. You can also see on the schematic that PPVRTC_G3H on page 7\/8 is 3.3v. You get 0.4v on PPVRTC_G3H.\n\nSo\n\n1) PPVRTC_G3H is supposed to be 3.3v.\n2) PPVRTC_G3H is 0.4v\n3) U2800 creates PPVRTC_G3H.\n4) U2800 is corroded & rusted looking.\n\nI need for you to be able to take this information that we have brought to light and come to a conclusion. Even if it is wrong, some conclusion. If you can't do this, then stop until you can.\n\nAlso answer duke's question on whether PP3V42_G3H is present, and what PPBUS_G3H voltage is."}
