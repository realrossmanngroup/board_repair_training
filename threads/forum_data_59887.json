After clean I get 20V, but no other response.\n\nWhen USB controller chips seem to be ok, where do we start from?\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> - - 1.2Ohm seems to be affected via <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> or vice versa\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - Short to the ground - 1.2Ohm on the <RESISTOR>R6907</RESISTOR> side of the F7000\nAs there are so many places this can be is it safe to inject up to 13V here?\n\nThanks"

Perhaps a sticky post with common mistakes we have learned will be great. \n\nI got excited when the fans spun up, but there was no activity anywhere else. Does dead CPU allows fans to spin up?\nPerhaps it doesn't worth changing <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> and digging more if dead cpu would show such signs.\n\nI am really after the data on this board, it has a J9600 but I still cannot justify buying the data migration tool due to amount of data recovery jobs I get for these couple compatible models. \nHave you seen any other way of getting data out?"
