            "message": "this macbook had had liquid damage, i replaced trackpad connector, i also changed efi chip, battery was dead and put in a new one. Today I connected the battery without fixing with double sided tape, I switched it on and everything went smoothly. Before turning off I deactivated autoboot with a command from the terminal. I turned off, I unplugged the battery, I reconnected everything and now it does not turn on anymore. When I connect the charger it has a normal current draw and 20v, the symbol of the charged battery appears for a moment and then nothing, dead. It does the same thing if I close and reopen the lid, for a moment just the battery symbol.\nWhat can I do? all this is very strange ....."
