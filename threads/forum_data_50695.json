            "message": "I ran across a 2017 MacBook that showed no signs of life.  I identified that a short existed and traced it down to the actual SSD drive. I did some reading online and discovered that apple had a recall for these and were replacing the LB and the SSD free of charge.  Thermal Imaging showed the short to be on one side of the flash memory modules inside the SSD.  I checked the SN of the machine and Apple said it did not qualify for the apple recall.\n\nSo the customer's data is toast and he will end up spending $350 and  have to reload his machine.  \n\nAre people seeing a lot of these out there?  This was my first one."
