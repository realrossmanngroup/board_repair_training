First, it wasen't booting the macos (freezed in the loading bar), and after the CleanME upgrade, the SSD is not recognized any more, even with a known good SSD.\n\nOn SSD connector J3700, I have 3.3V on all pins of PP3V3_S0SW_SSD_FLT\n\nSSD_SR_EN_L = 3.2V\n\nSSD_RESET_CONN_L = 3.4V\n\nSSD_PWR_EN = 0V\n\nI have 3.2V on R1620 SSD_PWR_EN , so I think that it is not the CPU (don't know if it makes sense).\n\nI think that it might be U8070, or U3711 or U3740.\n\nOn U3740 I have 3.2V on SSD_PWR_EN , but on U3711 I think that I have 0V on SSD_PWR_EN pin 1\n\nShall I replace U3711?"}

But after all I do have continuity bettewn U3740 and U3711, and the 3.2V on pin 1 of U3711 and 3.2V on SSD_PWR_EN in J3700.\n\nNot sure if it was the BIOS or a bad contact on U3711, but after restored the original BIOS, the mac now recognizes the disk, but freezes on the loading bar, even with another disk.\n\nCan you help?"}
