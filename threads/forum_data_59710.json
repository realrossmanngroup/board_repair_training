        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "CHGR_BMON": "What is CHGR_BMON? CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",
        "CHGR_AMON": "What is CHGR_AMON? CHGR_AMON provides DC current sense information to the SMC(System management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip). It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",

        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "U3100": "What is U3100? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO": "What is PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO? PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing chip. When this is missing, either a capacitor on the line has shorted, PP3V3_G3H is missing, or the CD3215 is bad.."

I got a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board in that is running perfectly fine but the battery seems to be draining even when the computer is turned off. I shutdown the computer last night from OSX with 48% battery and closed the lid and left it overnight unplugged. This morning when I opened the lid, it turned on with only 8% battery left. I checked the board with it off and the battery connected and do not have any voltage on the S5 rails. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.3v and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 11v. The board looks spotless, so not sure where to look. I have also tried to put the board in a completely different case with another battery and screen, but the battery is still draining about 5% every hour with the computer off."

I tested the board only with the charger and amp meter connected, and then I shorted <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> to ground and the board did not fully turn off. It was still using 19v and 0.15a, and I tried the same on a working board, and that one takes 19v 0.01a when off. While checking some rails with the board off and charger connected, I noticed <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> was getting very hot. Found a partial short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO</SIGNAL>, so I replaced <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> and now the board is only using 19v 0.01a when off, just like the good board. I will check tomorrow morning to make sure it did not drain battery overnight, but I thinks its solved. Weird that the issue was a <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> chip, since the board was turning on fine and both ports were working fine for charging at least."
