I'm more like into iPhone repair but I had some success in older Macbook repairs. This is not a customer board, it is for me to entertain myself in this hard covid times...\n\nI think I found a rabbit hole but I would like to ask for some guidance, and please be very clear and lucid with me, also with patience. Thank you.\n\nHIstory: It is water damaged.\nC7748 was shorted so I removed it.\n\nppbus_g3h_cpu steady 13.05V\nppbus_g3h steady 13.05V\npp3v3_s0 0V .170 in diode mode\npm_en_p3v3s0 0V\n\nFrom the power supply:\n19.9V\n0.04-0.06A\n0.03-0.08A\n\nWhere should I look next?\n\nThank you for your time."}

It is somewhere around C8233 where the heat comes from. I tried to use the alcohol method and the thermal camera method but the whole area is heating up.
