        "message":"I have a liquid spilled 820-3662 retina that had a minor liquid spill near the battery connector (customer used 50% alcohol to remove battery). No LED. Some spill was on ISL6258 area so I replaced that one and some small IC around it. Now the macbook can start up and working, it shows battery is charging in the top bar, however if I look in the system report - power it shows no charge, battery is going down. I have checked R5380 and R5381 they seem OK (2K Ohm). Any other suggestions? \n\nPS also tried another battery same story"

I only know red probe on ground black on measure point which is what i did:). Could it also be a bad ISL IC?"
