No LED. Some spill was on <CHIP>ISL6258</CHIP> area so I replaced that one and some small IC around it. Now the macbook can start up and working, it shows battery is charging in the top bar, however if I look in the system report - power it shows no charge, battery is going down. I have checked <RESISTOR>R5380</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5381</RESISTOR> they seem OK (2K Ohm). Any other suggestions? \n\nPS also tried another battery same story"

I only know red probe on ground black on measure point which is what i did:). Could it also be a bad ISL IC?"
