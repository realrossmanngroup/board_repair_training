I replaced both chips and now I get 20v in SUBC_VBUS , 13v ppbus_g3h ,3.3v PP3v3_GH3.\n\nThen PP5v_s5,PP3v3_s5, p5VP3V3_VREF pulisng and not stable. then became 0V  on pp5v_s5, pp3v3_S5 and PP3v3_s5 in shorted and 0v on diod mode.\n\nI injected 3.3v to pp3v3_S5 and heating component are U7800 and PCH. I replaced the U7800 and still  the short is there.\n\nAny adivce will be greatly appriciated.\n\nRegards\n\nDon"}
