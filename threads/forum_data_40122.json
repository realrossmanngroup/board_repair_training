I replaced both chips and now I get 20v in <SIGNAL>SUBC_VBUS</SIGNAL> , 13v <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> ,3.3v <SIGNAL>PP3V3_GH3</SIGNAL>.\n\nThen <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>,<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>P5VP3V3_VREF</SIGNAL> pulisng and not stable. then became 0V  on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> in shorted and 0v on diod mode.\n\nI injected 3.3v to <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> and heating component are <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> and PCH. I replaced the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> and still  the short is there.\n\nAny adivce will be greatly appriciated.\n\nRegards\n\nDon"
