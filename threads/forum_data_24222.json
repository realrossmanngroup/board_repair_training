        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",

        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "BLK_PWM": "What is BLK_PWM? BLK_PWM is a typo of BKL_PWM. When you see BLK_PWM assume the poster meant to type BKL_PWM. BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

I replaced that entire area around the lcd connector and the connector as well as the <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> and the LVDS cable.\n\nI am getting 0v on backlight while <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> has around 3.3v on pins 1-5. Here are some other measurements I got.\nJ8300:\nPin 3/4 - 0v\nPin 15 - 2.67v\nPin 16 - 3.28v\nPin 18/19 - 3.3v\nI get 2.5v on <SIGNAL>BLK_PWM</SIGNAL> but 0v on <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL>\nDiode Mode on Backlight output caps - 0.59v\n\nFor some reason when I turn the machine on I can see the LCD slightly changing colors as if the screen turned on and I can see a faint color change when I turn it off but I don't see any image on the screen. \nI don't have another display to test with but I plugged in an 11\" lcd only with another lvds cable and I was able to see an image on the screen either when putting a flashlight to it."

I can see a slight change in the darkness of the screen but no backlight comes on and I dont see an image when I put a flashlight on the apple logo.\n\nCould this be an issue with the LED Driver because before I put another one on I accidentally ripped the pad for <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> but I ran a wire for it and <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> is 2.5v.\nWhat would cause no image even though the lcd is recognized and getting voltage at the connector?\n\nUpdate: I took a look at the led driver at an angle and I saw that the balls for <SIGNAL>BKL_ISEN1</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>BKL_ISEN2</SIGNAL> were melted together. I think the reason is because when I ripped the pad for <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> I scratched a little too deep so when I put the new driver on there was a slope making it hard for the chip to sit correct.\n\nI removed <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> and powered on the board with a 11\" lcd only and I still was not able to see any image but again I got 3.3v on both sides of L8304."
