Shoved the stem of an ear bud in there and it detects audio.\nIn a absence of a replacement jack, is there a line I can cut or short to enable internal audio permanently?\n\n... Connect pin 2 and pin 1 of J6700?"}

The 17\" MacBook Pro 820-2849 board's jacks are slightly longer.\nI looked through every board in the pile to find the right size and came up short.\n\nTurns out that it just needed a UC. Dirty contact or something.\n\nPlease mark as solved. Thank you for your help."}
