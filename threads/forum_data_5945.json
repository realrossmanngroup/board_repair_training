            "message": "I had this board on the shelf for a while since I couldn't figure out the issue. It has already been UC'd and all the main power rails are present, the fan spins, cpu gets warm, usb mouse lights up but there was nothing showing on the screen, thunderbolt wasn't working and no chime. Thunderbolt comes from <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> so I assume this may be a problem.\n\nThere was small liquid damage by the <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> chip and I saw that <CAPACITOR>C1910</CAPACITOR> looked burned on Pin 1.\nThe VDD Pin, <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_TBTLC</SIGNAL> measured 3.3v but I still replaced the chip.\nWhen I removed <CAPACITOR>C1910</CAPACITOR> the pad for Pin1 was gone so I put a new chip on and ran a wire from Pin 1 of <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> to <CAPACITOR>C1910</CAPACITOR>.\n\nAfter I finished replacing everything and plugged the charger in I saw I was only getting 2.6v on Pins 1 and 5 of <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> as well as on <CAPACITOR>C1910</CAPACITOR>/<CAPACITOR>C0890</CAPACITOR>/<CAPACITOR>C0891</CAPACITOR>. <RESISTOR>R2040</RESISTOR> which is no stuff had 3.3v on Pin 1 and 2.6v on Pin 2. Also, randomly I would see 3.3v on both pins 1/5. I'm not sure if the fan connector could be causing this because even though the fan is locked in it is loose and I can pull it out and if I push the fan cable a certain way the fan will spin at normal speed or high speed.\n\nI removed <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C1910</CAPACITOR> and plugged in the charger and <RESISTOR>R2040</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C1902</CAPACITOR> started measuring 3.3v but <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> still shows around 2.7v. I got 0v on Pin 5 of <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>.\nI measured in diode mode on <CAPACITOR>C0890</CAPACITOR> and got 0.54v.\n\nWhat else could be pulling <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> down?\n\nCoincidentally Louis has a video of this similar issue posted today.\n\nAll of these measurements were done with no external cables plugged into the board."

I checked Pin 5/<CAPACITOR>C1902</CAPACITOR> and now I only get 2.05v and nothing on Pin 1 of <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>. I'm not sure if I may have overheated the chip trying to take it off that tough board. \n\nWhen I removed the chip again and plugged the charger in I got 3.34v on <CAPACITOR>C1902</CAPACITOR>."
