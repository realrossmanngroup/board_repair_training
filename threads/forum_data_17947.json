        "R6905": "What is R6905? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on older Macbooks, pre-2011 models. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging.."

            "message": "Hi,\n\nThis unit was exposed to a minor liquid spill. After cleaning it boots fine, but will trip the charger after some time. Checking for overvoltage on the main adapter DCIN i found 20+V. All resistance readings seem fine. I removed <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> to check if it was OK, witch it was not. After that I replaced <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> and everything seemed fine. After running some tests the same problem arose (20+V on adapter DCIN). Might be tripping only with battery connected.\n\nAny help on this? What might cause <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> die?\n\nThanks."
