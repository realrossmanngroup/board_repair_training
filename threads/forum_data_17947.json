        "message":"Hi,\n\nThis unit was exposed to a minor liquid spill. After cleaning it boots fine, but will trip the charger after some time. Checking for overvoltage on the main adapter DCIN i found 20+V. All resistance readings seem fine. I removed R6905 to check if it was OK, witch it was not. After that I replaced U6990 and everything seemed fine. After running some tests the same problem arose (20+V on adapter DCIN). Might be tripping only with battery connected.\n\nAny help on this? What might cause U6990 die?\n\nThanks."
