        "message":"So I've got 2 of these 820-3332 machines that do the exact same thing. both of them run great until you try to play a video in full screen, then they shut down. When booted back up i get the error report that says GPU Panic error. i ran ASD EFI and it passed. When i run ASD O.S. it fails for IC0R.\n\nalmost seems like another issue like in the 2010 15\" machines with the shit capacitor.\n\nhas anyone known this to be a common issue with this board?"
