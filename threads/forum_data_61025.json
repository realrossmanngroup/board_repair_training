Shut it down for inspection and it hasn't come back on since. SMC Reset changes the magsafe light, and PPBUS is 8.6v.\n\nThere was corrosion on U8005, and C8005 right beside it. I replaced both. \n\nI have PPBUS, PP3V42_G3H, PPVRTC_G3H, PP5V_S5. \n\nI'm missing PP5V_S4RS3. Missing PP3V3_SUS at BIOS, and missing SUS_EN as well.\n\nAt this point I'm beyond my limited expertise with power issues. Thanks for any advice!"}
