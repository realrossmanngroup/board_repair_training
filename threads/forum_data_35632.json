    "definitions": {
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP.",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "U3510": "What is U3510? a CHIP.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",
        "CPU_VR_EN": "What is CPU_VR_EN? CPU_VR_EN is an enable signal for CPU VCORE that is present when it is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. ALL_SYS_PWRGD, PM_RSMRST_L, PM_SLP_SUS_L, and PM_SLP_S3_L are necessary prerequisites for CPU_VR_EN to be present. .",

            "message": "This board had liquid damage only on the bottom side of the board from the <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> across to <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>.\nI replaced the following components initially to see if I could get it working.\n<CHIP>U1950</CHIP> + surrounding resistors/caps, <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> + resistors below it, <CAPACITOR>C6100</CAPACITOR>, <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>, <CAPACITOR>C1910</CAPACITOR>,\n<CAPACITOR>C5010</CAPACITOR>/17, <CAPACITOR>C5002</CAPACITOR>/07/08, <RESISTOR>R5177</RESISTOR>/78/79/80.\n\nAfter replacing all those it still wasn't turning on then I found out the trace from the <RESISTOR>R6120</RESISTOR> to <RESISTOR>R6110</RESISTOR> was gone so I ran a wire from <RESISTOR>R6110</RESISTOR> to Probe 750 and that repaired the trace and the board turned on and the Cpu got very warm so I turned it off and UC'd the board. I then realized there were damaged components I didn't replace so I replaced\n<CAPACITOR>C3510</CAPACITOR>,<CHIP>U3510</CHIP>, <CAPACITOR>C3280</CAPACITOR> + surrounding caps and most of the caps/resistors around the <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP>.\n\nAfter all that I turned the board on and the fan spin but the cpu doesn't get warm at all and there is no chime. <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is 0v while all the main power rails are present including <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL>.\n\nUpdate: Right after making this post Vcore came back and <SIGNAL>CPU_VR_EN</SIGNAL> was 1.05v. I assembled the machine and it turned on and booted to the login screen but then the screen went blank and the keyboard backlight stayed on. I shut it down and now when I turn it on it doesnt boot or chime but the fan spins for about  4 seconds, stops, then spins again continuously. Not sure what could be causing this intermittent issue."
