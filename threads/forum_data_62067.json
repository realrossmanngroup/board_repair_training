        "message":"I'm woking on an A 1708 MacBook Pro (820-00875) Which has a bad trackpad but a functioning keyboard.\n\nI replaced the trackpad with a known good trackpad and cable, reset SMC and PRAM, the trackpad is still not working . \nThe cursor does work with a USB mouse plugged in. \n\nChecked the F4800 trackpad fuse which is good.\nAs I understand from the schematics for this model, the keyboard and mouse inputs are both routed through the trackpad connector so my question is how is the keyboard working but the trackpad not?\n\nHas anyone seen something similar\/have any insight on this?"
