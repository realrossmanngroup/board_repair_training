There is suppose to be 5v on the VDD pins in order to turn on U7100(ISL6259) so I troubleshooted to the U7190 area since that is where PP5V1_CHGR_VDDP is created.\n\nI replaced U7190 with one from a donor board.\n\nHere are some of the measurements I got from the U7190 area.\n\nU7190 voltage | diode mode\npin 1 - 0.64v      0.688\npin 2 - 1.41v      0.003\npin 3 - 3.59v      0.361\npin 4 - 1.58v      0.004\npin 6 - 13.55v    0.56\npin 7 - shows 5v even though the schematic says it's a NC.\n\nI replaced C7195, R7195, R7196 and C7198\/C7199 with new parts from mouser. For some reason R7195 and R7196 both measure 155kohms even though they measured the proper resistance before I put them on the board. Is there something that could pull the resistance down?\n\nI get a short to ground on both sides of L7195 and when I remove it and check for the short on the pads I get a short only on the Pin 2 side."

Should I be troubleshooting P5VS0_EN?\n\nWorth noting: When I first had this board 6 months I was just starting and I was testing the board w\/o the heatsink on and the cpu would get hot so hopefully I didn't kill the cpu. Also, when probing around I caused u7700 to spark and it has a burn on the top of the chip.\nI also see a tiny bit of blue corrosion next to U1900 so I don't know if that could be causing any issues here."
