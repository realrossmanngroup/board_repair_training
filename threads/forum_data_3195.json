            "message": "I have <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-b logic board with no water damage signs the guy that send it to me told me that has knock down capacitor <CAPACITOR>C7251</CAPACITOR> 150UF 20% 6.3V POLY-BIA-SM i replace it but when i turn on the computer i still get 3 beeps. I've checked the RAM put few different ones I've checked the RAM slots under the microscope they look good i checked all rails are present also double checked for <SIGNAL>PVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> and i have that too. I was doing research online for the beeps i find out on apple website for trouble shooting that those beeps can indicate problems with RAM or the MCP. Kinda confused now. Any ideas ? Thank you"

Thanks for your help guys :)"
