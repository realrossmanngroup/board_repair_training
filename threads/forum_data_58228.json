This can be GPU dead?"

It never disappears, stays always with the same intensity, pressed or not.\nIf I press caps lock (or ESC, or space bar) several times just after the mouse switches off (the 30s), red light appears for 3-4 seconds, then no reactions. If I wait 5 seconds after switch off, no way to have a red light again.\nNo history on this laptop, it comes from Ebay, but I don't see any water damage"
