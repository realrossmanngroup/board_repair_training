In fact PP3V42 is present but I’m not getting a green light on the charger. There is sever corrosion on <CAPACITOR>C3740</CAPACITOR>, <RESISTOR>R3741</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R3742</RESISTOR>. <CHIP>U3740</CHIP> looks ok though but I’ll probably replace it to be safe. Issue is both pads for <CAPACITOR>C3740</CAPACITOR> and <RESISTOR>R3742</RESISTOR> and one pad for <RESISTOR>R3741</RESISTOR> are completely gone and <RESISTOR>R3742</RESISTOR> is now reading ground on both ends.\n\nI saw a slight amount of corrosion on pin 8 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> but upon removal it seems fine so I’m hoping that was just surface junk.\n\nQuestion is can the board boot without the above 3 mentioned pads intact? I’m not fussed about internal ssd I can always use a USB dock but I’m not sure if those are going to be required for boot or not. Unfortunately I do not have any donor boards to substitute these parts so it’s back to the Ali express waiting game.\n\nthanks!"

All the measurements previously provided were from this donor ISL. I then did the same on the original ISL the board came with and that's 4.6 for pin 17 to pin 18 & 4.71 on pins 27 to 28. I'm reinstalling this ISL now and will check pin one hopefully it will now be zero otherwise I'll have to wait for a new one to arrive. I had a quick google hoping someones posted the pin measurements on a known working ISL but unfortunately couldn't find anything."

Pin 6 on <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> is the only thing reading low ish now. .068 or 100 ohm. Is that suppose to be so low? \n\nA short pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R7105</RESISTOR> could could also cause it to fail couldn't it? I'm starting to think something on that side may be causing it since everything on the pin 1 side has been replaced multiple times. <RESISTOR>R7190</RESISTOR> for example looks pretty ugly but it's only reading 1 ohm in circuit so if that was blown it should be higher than that considering it's suppose to be 0 ohm.

I don't believe I have replaced that yet, nor most of the components on the <SIGNAL>PP5V1_CHGR_VDDP</SIGNAL> line. <RESISTOR>R7101</RESISTOR> is reading bang on what it should be 4.7 ohm but that does not mean there's not a issue on that rail."

When I replaced all the components on the <RESISTOR>R7105</RESISTOR> pin 1 side and replaced the ISL last, I re checked all the components surrounding the ISL on each of the ISL pins to make sure nothing was reading short, which nothing did bar pin 6 which while not technically short did make me question why it was seemingly a low value.\n\nSorry, made a bit of a typo there. No <CHIP>U7190</CHIP> is not there, only components populated in that area are <RESISTOR>R7190</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7191</RESISTOR>. I think it was the <CHIP>TPS51980</CHIP> that I mistook for <CHIP>U7190</CHIP> since it looked like there was a tiny bit of green to the right side pins but very faint hard to tell. But that cant be the issue as none of the lines around the ISL go to the TPS? \n\nAre you sure <RESISTOR>R7190</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7191</RESISTOR> are marked as no stuff in your schematic? Mine there not, most other components are but there not. Page 70 of 120.  \nConfused as to why <RESISTOR>R7105</RESISTOR> keeps blowing when there are only 3 components on that line, and they have all been replaced multiple times. Do we have a pin out on diode mode readings both board side and of the ISL itself? I had a quick google search but couldn't find anything. That would help rule out a ISL issue."

This was your typical ebay \" don't know what's wrong with it we haven't touched it\" listing, so they have obviously tried to repair it and saw it was not listed as no stuff and placed it there. Curious that it's not listed as no stuff in my schematic though. Which one are you using? I got mine from the usual place, badcaps. I've also got Zin Zhi Zao which also does not list it as no stuff. \n\nIf the ISL was shorted though you should be able to pick that up by testing the pads on the chip itself shouldn't you? Pin 2 is shorted at pin 2 of <CAPACITOR>C7105</CAPACITOR> on the board but when I remove the ISL and re test the short is gone. But than I diode mode the chips pin 2 to ground you get .602"
