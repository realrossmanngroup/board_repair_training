        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

        "CPUVR_PGOOD_R": "What is CPUVR_PGOOD_R? CPUVR_PGOOD_R is a signal that comes from CPU_VR_EN that is necessary along with ALL_SYS_PWRGD to create PM_S0_PGOOD.",

        "P1V8S3_PGOOD": "What is P1V8S3_PGOOD? P1V8S3_PGOOD is a signal that denotes that the PP1V8_S3 power rail is working..",
