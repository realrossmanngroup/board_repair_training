            "message": "Got a board in that has no signs of liquid damage, has magsafe light but no other signs of life. Found F7040 blown, replaced after checking that things around the ISL looked par for the course. Still no fan spin and the smell of something getting hot. Long story short in a rabbit hole removing anything that could possibly short the rail to ground <TRANSISTOR>Q3080</TRANSISTOR>, isloated the part of the rail from the back light, etc. Im starting to think this board may have a CPU short and that its a donor board. Resistance between pin 1 and pin 2 of L7310 and L7320 is 0.2 Ohm. Is there any hope are should I tell the client \"He's Dead Jim.\"?"
