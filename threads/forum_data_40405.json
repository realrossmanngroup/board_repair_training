            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have a board that will boot from ASD flash drives but it won't boot from my USB 2.5\" SSD macOS test drive. The other problem is that when the wifi card is connected, it won't boot. I'm guessing it's to do with the BT side. Tried with a known good card.\n\nI also noticed that the USB controller test in ASD failed when I had my 2.5\" USB SSD connected. At the same time, the screen was extremely flickery. I couldn't reproduce the behaviour again though.\n\nThis board has had liquid damage but it's been worked on before :( So there is flux and probe scrapes all over the place. Any help would be appreciated."
