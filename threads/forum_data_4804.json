            "message": "HI, I am new to this group and also pretty new at mac board repairs.  Ive watched videos, but to be honest I am almost 40 and my brain cant soak in stuff as quickly as I would like it to.  Goal here is to learn from you all.  I have a macbook pro 15inc 2010 board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>.  I heard these board suck to work on.  I also heard that the capacitor <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> suck too and common problem on this board.  The symptom I am having with this particular board is that it shuts down and kernal panics when I open 2 or more applications.  It powers on fine and seems like everything is working.  I tested the ram separately by booting it up with it individually and getting same results. I even used different ram to be sure and getting same results in that scenario.  I would like to change out <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> with a Polymer capacitor and than see what result I get.  I am just not sure which one to order from Mouser.  Could someone help point me to which one? and also any other steps I need or should look into to find the correct solution for this issue.  Thanks all.\n\n[url]http://www.mouser.com/Passive-Components/Capacitors/Polymer-Capacitors/_/N-bjuf7?P=1z0z7ymZ1z0wrktZ1z0x63tZ1ynye84[/url]"
