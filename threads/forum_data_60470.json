It will happen during boot or when MacOS is fully loaded.\nDuring boot, for a split second the apple logo will sometimes have a red square background and the loading bar becomes green. \nThe it will go into boot loop or get stuck not turning on at all.\nWhen J6951 is not connected (no battery power), it seems to run fine.\nSYS_DETECT_L is 0.02V, SMBUS_SMC_5_G3G_SCL and .._SDA are both 3.38V, no shorts to ground.\nPutting the logic board in another topcase shows same symptoms.\nAlso tried another SSD and external drive. \nOwner says it happened after OS update. Then he changed the SSD and it was fine for 3 days. Has been showing these symptoms since."}
