The fans come on high after about 5 seconds. ran ASD EFI and it fails for Ts0P. the reading is showing -124c. \n\ni understand that this sensor is in the trackpad ribbon. I changed with known good trackpad and cable, but still the same issue. thought i would check j5800 for short to ground, everything came back just fine except pin 18( pp5v_s5_cumulus) it showed .0L on the multi meter. \n\nnot sure where to go on this one, can't seem to find anything in the schematic about Ts0P. any ideas?"}

If it is being interfered with, or shorted to ground, you can tell by checking diode mode to ground number on that line itself. Typically unplugging bad webcam cable solves this problem but in rare case it is the webcam connector itself - also drove me nuts on a 3437 where I couldn't see any corrosion from the outside, even with a microscope."}

Never seen this on the web cam connector before, i've seen it on the lcd connector due to the lock.\n\nThanks again duke fawks and louis rossmann.   SOLVED."}
