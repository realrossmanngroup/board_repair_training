            "message": "I have a board that runs fine on battery, however I get no green light on the charger. All the power rails are there and even adapter sense but only at <CHIP>U6901</CHIP> and <CHIP>U6900</CHIP>. There is most likely an internal short on Adapter Sense as there is no continuity from pin 5 of <CHIP>U6901</CHIP> to pin 5 of the DC In connector. Pin 5 of the DC In connector is shorted to ground along with what I assume is the associated test point nearby. Adapter sense is not shorted by <CHIP>U6901</CHIP> however. Is there an arts and crafty way to save this board?"
