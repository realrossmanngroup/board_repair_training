All the power rails are there and even adapter sense but only at U6901 and U6900. There is most likely an internal short on Adapter Sense as there is no continuity from pin 5 of U6901 to pin 5 of the DC In connector. Pin 5 of the DC In connector is shorted to ground along with what I assume is the associated test point nearby. Adapter sense is not shorted by U6901 however. Is there an arts and crafty way to save this board?"}
