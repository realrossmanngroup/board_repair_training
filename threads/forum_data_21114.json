It's a bit in depth but you'll see how the software and hardware works.\n\n[URL]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FLG03f_ua5g[\/URL]\n\n\nNo here is how to remove that password....\n\nPull the chip from the board and plug it up to the programmer. I have used a different BIOS chip but you'll have to solder some little legs on to the Pro Retina BIOS chip because it's a WSON8 package.\n\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t1.JPG Views:\t1 Size:\t388.3 KB ID:\t22951\"]22951._xfImport[\/ATTACH]\nOnce you\u2019re plugged in open the MiniPro app (comes with the TL866) and select 25 flash detect.\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t2.png Views:\t1 Size:\t2.09 MB ID:\t22952\"]22952._xfImport[\/ATTACH][ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t3.png Views:\t1 Size:\t2.11 MB ID:\t22953\"]22953._xfImport[\/ATTACH]\nClick detect It will give you a short list of possible chips so just match it to the part number on your chip.\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t4.png Views:\t1 Size:\t2.13 MB ID:\t22954\"]22954._xfImport[\/ATTACH]\nThen read\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t5.png Views:\t2 Size:\t2.09 MB ID:\t22955\"]22955._xfImport[\/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t6.png Views:\t1 Size:\t2.10 MB ID:\t22956\"]22956._xfImport[\/ATTACH]\nWhen it\u2019s done reading the file from the chip the cancel button will no longer be greyed (greyed?) out. So click cancel.\nThen save the file to you desktop. It will save as a .bin file. Call it BIOS1.bin\nRead the chip a second time and save the file as BIOS2.bin so if you fuck something up you have a backup file.\n\nDownload HxD [URL=\"http:\/\/download.cnet.com\/HxD-Hex-Editor\/3000-2352_4-10891068.html\"]http:\/\/download.cnet.com\/HxD-Hex-Edi...-10891068.html[\/URL]\n\nOpen the BIOS1.bin with HxD and search for $SVS\n\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t8.png Views:\t1 Size:\t995.2 KB ID:\t22957\"]22957._xfImport[\/ATTACH]\nSelect the small block of nonsense after $SVS\n\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t9.png Views:\t1 Size:\t1,002.0 KB ID:\t22958\"]22958._xfImport[\/ATTACH]\nRight click and select fill section\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\t10.png Views:\t1 Size:\t1,011.1 KB ID:\t22959\"]22959._xfImport[\/ATTACH]\nThen fill with FF.

What you edited will show up red.\nSave the file as unlocked.bin\n\nNow erase your BIOS chip from the drop down as before when you read the chip\n\nOnce it has finished erasing do a blank check from the same dropdown.\n\nOnce it has varified the chip is blank just open your unlocked.bin and flash it back to the chip with the program option from the same dropdown as the above image.\n\nSlap the chip back on the board.\nPower in and PRAM reset.\nBoot into an installer USB and erase the SSD.\nInstall a clean OS.\n\nDone\n\n\nBut failing all that you could just buy a chip from eBay for $25. eBay for 820-xxxx BIOS CHIP and slap one of those on there.\nHere is one for the 820-4924\n\n[URL=\"http:\/\/www.ebay.co.uk\/itm\/EFI-BIOS-firmware-chip-for-Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-A1502-Early-2015-820-4924-A-\/112470194660?hash=item1a2fbef9e4:g:dPMAAOSwnNBXVL3p\"]http:\/\/www.ebay.co.uk\/itm\/EFI-BIOS-f...MAAOSwnNBXVL3p[\/URL]"}
