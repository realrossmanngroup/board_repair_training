            "message": "Hello, as the titles says I got a water damage macbook pro (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) with no power or green light at the mag safe. My voltages on the main lines are the following: <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 0v, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.42v, and <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 20.62v.  I have taken a look at my line <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and noticed that I have a short on <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>CHGR_CSO_R_P</SIGNAL> which is why I have 0v on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. During visual inspection, I noticed that <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> was completely blown (Pin 3 and 4 are completely gone). I have attached a pic for referral, I have tried to find this short but I haven't been successful. If Im not mistaken, the short im having is due to <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> blowing the pad and merging it to ground. If anyone can enlingthen me it will be greatly appreciated. Not sure how to approach this anymore. Thanks!\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"200px\"]20679._xfImport[/ATTACH]"
