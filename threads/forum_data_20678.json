My voltages on the main lines are the following: PPBUS_G3H 0v, PP3V42_G3H 3.42v, and PPDCIN_G3H 20.62v.  I have taken a look at my line PPBUS_G3H and noticed that I have a short on PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG and CHGR_CSO_R_P which is why I have 0v on PPBUS_G3H. During visual inspection, I noticed that R7050 was completely blown (Pin 3 and 4 are completely gone). I have attached a pic for referral, I have tried to find this short but I haven't been successful. If Im not mistaken, the short im having is due to r7050 blowing the pad and merging it to ground. If anyone can enlingthen me it will be greatly appreciated. Not sure how to approach this anymore. Thanks!\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"200px\"]20679._xfImport[\/ATTACH]"}
