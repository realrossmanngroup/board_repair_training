After removing remainging underfill and properly reflowing the SMC, the unit powered on chimed once and then shut off. PRAM resets would not work, SMC resets would. I tracked it down to a BIOS issue the original BIOS dump had about 4 lines of code and the rest 0s. I found a BIOS dump to test and the unit powers on, PRAM resets, gets starts loading into a bootable USB and then freezes 3\/4 of the way through, typical ME problems. I have tried to clean the ME region as I normally do and for the life of me no matter what version 9.0.3..., 9.0.5.1367, or 9.1.... all I get is the original problem with the corrupt BIOS, one chime and then powers off, no PRAM reset. I will upload the original BIOS dump as well as my most recent ME attempt.\n\n[url]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1LCC7FDYD_t3dpWy-B4EGMHM_q774rGBy[\/url]"}

No way it would chime if it was only 4 lines of code."}
