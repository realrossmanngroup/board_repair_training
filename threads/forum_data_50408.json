Also, Camera can be disconected separately (small cable left to the USB C side), makes no difference. \nalso i have 1/2 Sec pulses on Airport Temp sensor (the only one i can measure in chassey) \nwithout Display  all sensors except SSD Temp and Airport are OK, pulse is the same, 1M to ground. \nwith SSD removed 128C are on Mainboard Proximity and Airport.\nis it okay for temp sensor to pulse voltage? \nI still hope this is mainboard side problem since i still have failed sensors without the display assembly. <CHIP>U5870</CHIP> is a good candidate to check, but CPU sensors are OK. \nTheres nothing funny on SMC line either, just bursts of signals."

I mean i do not see any difference on oscilloscope, but it definetely fucks up the whole line. Afaik it fails pretty often in the exact same way. Good job apple for putting some non-critical light sensor on the line which is used for the temp meter IC."
