Sadly last fuse i had got away from me while removing it from my last donor board. Ordered some fuses and will have to give an update later. If you guys think running a wire to get 12v from the fuse to the transistors around <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> to push12v through the mosfets is a bad idea let know. So far its all i can think of to get this voltage flowing again."
