        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",

            "message": "Hello,\ni am working on a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that has no green light. It was water damaged an i fixed some corrosion already. Now, if i plug the charger in it shows a green light for a second but than it turns off again. Without unplugging the charger the light comes back on after a minute or so and than turns off again instantly. (actually one or two times i want to measure it it stays on and the cpu was getting warm) I measured around and saw that <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is not there and also <SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> (and so also <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL>) is not there (causing The <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> to stop working and <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> to be missing). I checked for a short to GND on <SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> but there is no. <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> is something between 1,2V and 0,6V (slowls fading) until it peaks to 16V (when the green light appears for a second) and than fades away again. I already replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> twice (to be sure because the probepoint of <SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> next to <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> was corroded and not conducting anymore but the actual Pad (Pad 2) of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and the rest of the line looks fine so far- i fixed that probepoint). I also had to run a wire under (to pin 3) <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> because there was another a no longer conducting Probepoint. Now my wire (at pin 3) is conducting connected to the metal case of <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> (i measured some voltages there and discovered this connecction) but as far as i understand: this in clearly not ideal and i´ll correct that if it works but for now it should not be the problem, as the case of <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> is only soldered to NC Pads on the board. I also followed <SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> to F6905 and <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> is also only 1,2V-0,6V. Now i don´t know hat to do. I tryed a different DCIN board already and i will try another tomorow to make sure it is fine.\nThanks for any help!"

I repaired the backlight and after that i noticed that it won´t boot up all the way. If i try to install an OS but it hangs after the apple disappears and it i want to boot from a drive with an OS installed.  It also stops with a white screen after the apple finished loading. I tryed differend HDDs and HDD cables but still the same. Even without the HDD cable connected it won´t get to the installation menu. Now i am stuck again"
