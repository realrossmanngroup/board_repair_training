        "message":"A client brought in a board heavily damaged by her chai late.\n\nAbout 1cm of the board all the way along the top was submerged. \n\nI've US'd the board and cleaned it off so it looks nice and clean now. However we have no light on the charger and no life signs.\n\nI suspect the circuit below is damaged and that D7012 needs to be replaced as all the voltages before that point seem to match my good board. Somehow that area also had corrosion... But the majority of the liquid \"was\" on the other side of the board. \n\nGiven the extent of the ingress is it worth proceeding or is it a waste of time?\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59320[\/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"406px\"]59319[\/ATTACH]"
