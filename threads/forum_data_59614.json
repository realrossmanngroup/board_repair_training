When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",

PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H is the input voltage to the PP3V42_G3H buck converter circuit, it can be either charger voltage or battery voltage depending on what the system power source is. This often shorts to ground when one of the input capacitors dies. ."

However we have no light on the charger and no life signs.\n\nI suspect the circuit below is damaged and that <DIODE>D7012</DIODE> needs to be replaced as all the voltages before that point seem to match my good board. Somehow that area also had corrosion... But the majority of the liquid \"was\" on the other side of the board. \n\nGiven the extent of the ingress is it worth proceeding or is it a waste of time?\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59320[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"406px\"]59319[/ATTACH]"
