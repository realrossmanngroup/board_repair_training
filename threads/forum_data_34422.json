        "820-2530": "What is 820-2530? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "R6905": "What is R6905? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on older Macbooks, pre-2011 models. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",
        "D6905": "What is D6905? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input on very old Macbooks(before 2011), can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",

        "U6990": "What is U6990? a CHIP.",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H? PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H is the input voltage to the PP3V42_G3H buck converter circuit, it can be either charger voltage or battery voltage depending on what the system power source is. This often shorts to ground when one of the input capacitors dies. .",
        "C6990": "What is C6990? Capacitor to ground on input to PP3V42_G3H power supply. PP3V42_G3H power supply turns 18.5v from charger or 8.5v-12.5v PPBUS_G3H from the battery into PP3V42_G3H. This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger."

            "message": "<RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> keep dying (burning up) i tried running it out of the circuit but it just keeps failing. Then i ran voltage to it to see if i find a short and <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> blew up replaced but <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> keeps going bad. The multimeter isnt beeping to indicate a short but i suspect maybe <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_S5_3V42G3H</SIGNAL> is killing the resistor? \n\nwhat should i check?"
