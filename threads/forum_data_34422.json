        "message":"R6905 keep dying (burning up) i tried running it out of the circuit but it just keeps failing. Then i ran voltage to it to see if i find a short and d6905 blew up replaced but r6905 keeps going bad. The multimeter isnt beeping to indicate a short but i suspect maybe ppdcin_s5_3v42g3h is killing the resistor? \n\nwhat should i check?"
