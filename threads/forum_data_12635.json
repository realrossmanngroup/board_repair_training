I got the same result.\nThese are on my test external HD.\n\nI tried my SSD with El Capitan and got the same problem so this is\nnot the USB ports problem.\n\nI tried to tun ASD 3S162 but it says it's not compatible.\nThis should be a Late 2013 macbook.\n\nI don't have the ASD 3S159 but I never had a problem\nwith the newer 3S162. I'm only using the EFI versions.\n\nWTF could this be? Someone maybe messed with the BIOS?\nI checked the board for corrosion but only I found was around the eDP connector.\n\nThanks."
