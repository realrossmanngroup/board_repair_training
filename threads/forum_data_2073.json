        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",

        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

It doesn't have any history of water damage. Every time I connect the magsafe (60W) to the computer it flashes green and orange very rapidly. I have taken some measurements and from what I can see the computer fails to switch to the S0 state due to a short on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I have tried to inject some voltage into this line to find the short but nothing is getting hot. I have checked the charging circuitry (<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>) and it looks ok. I don't have a good board to compare. Any ideas?
