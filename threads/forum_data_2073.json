        "message":"Hello, I have a MacAir 2011 A1370  BRD: 820-3024-B that doesn't turn on. It doesn't have any history of water damage. Every time I connect the magsafe (60W) to the computer it flashes green and orange very rapidly. I have taken some measurements and from what I can see the computer fails to switch to the S0 state due to a short on PP5V_S3. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I have tried to inject some voltage into this line to find the short but nothing is getting hot. I have checked the charging circuitry (U7000) and it looks ok. I don't have a good board to compare. Any ideas? Thanks!\n\nPPBUS_G3H   8.35v   (12.8v)\nPPDCIN_G3H 17.06v (12.8v)\nPP3V42_G3H  3.40v   (3.42v)\n\nPP5V_S5 4.80v  \n*PP5V_S3 0v  \nPP5V_S0 0.17 \n\nPP3V3_S5 3.32v\nPP3V3_S3 0.24v\nPP3V3_S0"
