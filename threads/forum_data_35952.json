It has green light on magsafe but no fan spin. during visual inspection i found heavy corrosion on u6100 (sst25vf064c)\n\n1) can this chip prevent the board from booting up? \n2) what is the purpose of this chip?\n\nthanks,"}

Usually the traces are corroded and also the resistors that are in the data lines. Look up \"termination resistors\" in the schematic around U6100 and verify the traces and resistors are  good."}

You cannot simply just put a new BIOS on and say good to go on the newer i5 and i7 machines!!! You need to read the old chip to transfer the ME OR set the new chip up with a clean ME. Duke can help you on that he's a boss at it. But NEVER just put a new BIOS on an send it off unless it's the old C2D machines."}

Its a simple logic gate it provides the (cs) chip select for the bios. The device won't work without it. so its not necessary to transfer the ME region. Duke, please correct me if I'm wrong\n\n[URL=\"https:\/\/assets.nexperia.com\/documents\/data-sheet\/74LVC1G99.pdf\"]https:\/\/assets.nexperia.com\/docu...\/data-sheet\/74LVC1G99.pdf[\/URL]"}

U6101 is the logic gate that does what you just said. If you replaced U6101, then you are ok. If you replaced U6100, then you are not ok."}

The ME region needs to be fixed and serial\/model numbers should be fixed too."}
