I ignored the basic rule to pay attention to corroded components, or components with gray end caps. I found another forum post where the person had the same problem on an 820-3437 board. The PP3V3_S5 rail was shorted. They measured the coil (L7560) and found that a cap or two was shorted. So I decided to measure the same coil on my board well lo and behold PP3V3_S5 was short, by the same caps. they were C3280 and C3281 respectively, and are located close to the LCD connector. The end caps were gray but didn't look too bad. well once I took them off, the short was gone. Put some replacements from a donor and now we have fan spin and a ? folder. i should have known better since these two caps are tied to the mic connector which burnt up. lesson learned."}
