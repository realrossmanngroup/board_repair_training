It does boost on all 4 ports to 20V, switches on to 180mA, drops down to 20-30mA and switches back on to 180mA then stays at this level. No <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> although <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> signal is present on pin 48 of ISL (3.3V level). All other coils have the correct voltages (comparing to the table of measurements taken from working MLB). <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> resistance to ground = 6 Ohm, no short circuit on any surrounding capacitor. Replaced <CHIP>ISL95828</CHIP> controller and both SIC635 switches, no luck. What to do next?\n\nEDIT 1: Checked with an oscilloscope and no single pulse at primary side of CPU coils when the MLB takes 180mA and <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> signal goes up."
