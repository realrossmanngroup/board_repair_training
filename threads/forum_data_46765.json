    "definitions": {
        "R7012": "What is R7012? a RESISTOR.",
        "C7376": "What is C7376? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "D7012": "What is D7012? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year model macbook airs, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "820-3584": "What is 820-3584? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER."

I replace the <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> 2 times no changes, only works after to replace <RESISTOR>R7012</RESISTOR>. \n\nAfter 2 weeks this one comes back with same problem! \n\nIt has happened to me many times, i repair many machines with a shorted cap or some times corrosion on simple component and after repair the main problem next the machine don't charge with a fake charge! \n\nThis one is giving me a headache!"
