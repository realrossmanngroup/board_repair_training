The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",

I am sure the ram i reball is good, because it work perfect the other night, theres no way the solder is bridging overnight.\n\nis the 3.3v on <SIGNAL>1V8_S3</SIGNAL> because of <CHIP>U7870</CHIP> ?"
