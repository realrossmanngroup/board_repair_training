            "message": "Normally I'm pretty good at tracking down bouncing voltages due to shorts, SMC issues, etc, but this one has me stumped. Any help is much appreciated:\n\n0. No liquid, board DID have a cracked <TRANSISTOR>Q7802</TRANSISTOR> when I got it...replaced that first thing, before applying power to the board. Inspected rest of board very, very closely for damaged/missing components after seeing this. No other physical issues found.\n1. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.58v\n2. <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.43v\n3. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> bounces so quick multimeter can't catch it; initially found <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL> shorted (.000) which turned out to be <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>. Replaced <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> and diode back up to around .100; I'm wondering if there's still a small short present? Good board is .120...I attribute this to discharge/etc.\n4. <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> bouncing as well, but my ppbus is 12.56 so I thought MAYBE damaged SMC, but replaced it and symptoms remain the exact same.\n5. No shorts found after resolving the one on <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL>; checked <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL>-s0, <SIGNAL>5V_S5</SIGNAL>-s0, vrtc, 1v5, 1v05, etc.\n\nUsually I make enough headway to figure it out, but this one has me confused. Where else should I be looking for the cause of <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> to be bouncing? I thought this was a power cycle, but the SMC is not resetting as my <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is stable, correct? My next steps were to see if <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL> killed any of the state switches (<TRANSISTOR>Q7810</TRANSISTOR>/30, etc), or <TRANSISTOR>Q7812</TRANSISTOR>? But if I'm going to blindly replace things, I'd much rather ask before doing so, to learn what to measure next, etc.\n\nAll help appreciated; not wanting to spend hours and hours on this one, so wanted to ask early. Thanks again! Really appreciate it."

            "message": "Hey Duke. <SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is coming high for a split second (confirmed with osc.), as is <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. Replaced <CHIP>U7941</CHIP>, no dice; same behavior. Also, my diode reading for <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL> did go up after replacing <CHIP>U7941</CHIP>, from ~.99 - .100 (steady), to .110 (good board around .120). So I think you're right, there's something else damaged on <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. I'll look around the schematics a bit and try to find a culprit (knowing now that <CHIP>U7941</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> were both damaged). If you have any ideas, I'd really appreciate it. This is a 2.8 board, so I'm more inclined to spend a bit more time on it. Thanks so much, duke.\n\nedit: <SIGNAL>3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> also comes high briefly, if that helps."
