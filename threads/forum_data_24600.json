ASD report GPU problem but you know apple no more replacing boards.\nReplaced 2 times GPU with new one but now when loading OS freezing and EFI ASD not report error:(  ( Chines seller say new but i cant be sure DataCode is 1240 ) last month same problem solved by replace GPU from donor board and working without problem. \n\nSo do you have any idea witch chip can be use alternative for this board or you can share known good chip?\n\nThanks"
