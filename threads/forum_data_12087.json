Spent 3 days with working with Jason last month to get started (which was awesome, by the way), upgraded all my equipment, and am now working on my first real MacBook board repair. I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that's been liquid damaged. When I received it, it had no green light. <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H</SIGNAL> was showing 0V. <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> looked pretty bad so I lifted it, cleaned the contacts on the board and the IC, and resoldered. Now I have green light, but no fan. Started checking rails with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and found 0V.\n\nIs replacing the SMC the next step? Or am I jumping to conclusions by going straight to the SMC?"

Found the thread that suggests where to find good donor boards and have ordered a bunch. Only donor board on hand had a <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> that looked even shittier than the one on this board, so I decided to try to reuse it to see what happened.

Anyhow change them as the reading are way off ![/QUOTE]\n\nYes, they do look bad. I meant to mention earlier that many of the caps and resistors surrounding <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> look bad. I changed <CAPACITOR>C7050</CAPACITOR>, <RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR>, and <RESISTOR>R7052</RESISTOR> and now pins 17/18 measure 3.2 ohms.\n\n\n[QUOTE=\"dukefawks, post: 12127\"]Corroded traces in the <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR>/51/52 circuit is likely too.[/QUOTE]\n\nTraces seemed fine when I checked the other day, but I revisited that today and found something interesting. Pins 17/18 and 27/28 were shorting. I cleaned up the solder a bit and that fixed 17/18 but not 27/28. With 17/18 no longer shorted, I found that the trace from pin 18 to <CAPACITOR>C7050</CAPACITOR> is bad, so I jumpered. Strangely enough, after jumpering, pins 17/18 are shorted again, even though solder work still looks good under the scope. Pins 27/28 look good under the scope too, but remain shorted. A check of all pins showed a short on 19/20 as well.\n\nI'm inclined at this point to wait for the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> chips and/or the donor boards that I ordered before proceeding further. Seems like there's a good chance I'm just dealing with a shitty <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, right?"
