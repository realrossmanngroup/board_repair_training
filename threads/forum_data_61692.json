The board appears clean.\n\nhere are the following readings\nPPVRTC_G3H : 3.3v\nPM_SYSRST_L :1.9v LOW?\nPM_PCH_PWROK:  MISSING\nPM_RSMRST_L: 3.3v\nPM_PWRBTN_L: 3.3v\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN: 3.3v\nPM_BATLOW_L: 3.3v\n\nOne of the issues seems to be PM_SYSRST_L is only 1.9v. That line is powered by PP3V3_S0, which is also 1.9v.\nI am missing my P3V3S0_EN to turn on u8030 which produces my needed PP3V3_S0.\nTo produce P3V3S0_EN I need PM_SLP_S3_L which is 0v. Now I am unsure where that gets produced or maybe my logic is just way off on this whole path I am following. Thanks for any help.

I am assuming trigger must mean short to ground. Can I check for a drop pulse by just holding a voltage meter on PM_PWRBTN_L?\n\ncan I ask another question? how come I have 1.9volts on pp3v3_s0? Is that even possible without PM_SLP_S4_L?"}
