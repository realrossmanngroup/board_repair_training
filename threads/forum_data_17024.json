My computer boots to grey screen and the white bar moves to right about halfway, and then it stops and screen then goes black.\nAfter messing with it for about two hours, it finally booted and everything was fine for a few days, then it stopped again. I suspect a poor solder job that changes as the computer heats up.\"\n\nHere is a video of what happens. It boots to about halfway then something shows up on the screen and then everything goes black and repeats the cycle.\n[URL]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IVoFUQAkBEo[\/URL]\n\nASD EFI passed and the customer said there no liquid damage or previous repairs done. I see a few discolored probe points but nothing to make me say there was liquid damage for sure."
