            "message": "So I had a bit of free time to look through some of my boards with weird issues and I had this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01958</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> which had sound only from headphones - no sound from speakers at all. Troubleshooting got me to <SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> having an odd diode mode reading (0.002) and 20ohms to ground. Obviously went through checking which as many of you on here will know this stupid T2 chip turned out to be the reason. \n\nGiven all the other data lines and such were ok including <SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_INT_L</SIGNAL>  I decided to do some experimentation. First I tried tieing <SIGNAL>SPKAMP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> with a 100K resistor to the <SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> Rail - no go, I then tried a 50K Resistor which also was a no go and also a 10K Resistor. Just for the hell of it I thought i'll just run a wire directly to <SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> from <SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> and switch on get the apple chime nice and loud and sound is now working.\n\nWhilst I know this isn't a perfect solution it is one way of getting the speakers working again if the T2 chip has been slightly damaged to cause this issue and I thought i'd just share this solution with everyone here."
