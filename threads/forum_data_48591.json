Ultrasoniced it, replaced some IC and display and all working fine except the audio port. It shows the red light and digital out, no speakers detected. Already tried to clean with alcohol, but it was already in the ultrasonic so that didnt do the trick. WHat should i check first?\n\nAddon: I found also that HDMI gives a purple display, i can see everything but purple. The output from the Thunderbold ports & display is fine, so seems no GPU issue. If any idea pls let me know. I already tried to replace the IO board + cable. Same with a new one."}
