            "message": "This is odd. Typically this is a logical problem or a power problem.\n\nA logical problem is that the SMC is unable to communicate with the battery - it doesn't see the battery due to a short on a data line, or the SMC is dead. That does not appear to be the case because <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is the proper voltage and there are no shorts on that data line. \n\nA power problem is when a rail that can be powered off the charger or the battery is not working off the battery. Take <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and observe <RESISTOR>R6990</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR>, for instance. <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is the first rail that must be initialized, so it has inputs from the battery(<RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR>) and the charger(<RESISTOR>R6990</RESISTOR>). If <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> were blown, then <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> would only work off the charger. Even if the battery [I]were[/I] charged, battery power would never make its way to <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> would never be present. That is not the case here because, as you say, it will turn on from the battery for a short period due to <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>.\n\nIt does not appear to be a logical problem either. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.56v, which it would not be if the data line to the battery were destroyed. The same data line to the battery from the SMC, is the data line between the SMC and the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> chip that tells <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> to make <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.56v. When that data line is destroyed you would only have 12.23v. \n\nIn this case I would guess the issue is SMC. The data provided is too trolling and inconclusive to be certain, but without more history/signs of corrosion that is all I can provide. Something like [I]\"this happened when someone tried to replace their own battery\"[/I] is helpful - it would mean that they likely shorted the battery power to the data line which would mean clear cut case of replacing SMC/<CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>."
