Have tested the LCD onto another machine and it is working.\n\nVoltage measured on <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> with LCD connected.\n<SIGNAL>LCD_IG_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> :  3.28v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_LCD</SIGNAL> : 3.28v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_LCDVDD_SW</SIGNAL> : 0.15v\nResistance mesure at pin 2&3 with LCD : 4.62k\nResistance mesure at pin 2&3 without LCD : 81.7k\n\nHave replaced <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> twice but <SIGNAL>PP3V3_LCDVDD_SW</SIGNAL> still at 0.15v\n\nI think LCD is being detected as testing without the LCD connected, <SIGNAL>LCD_IG_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> drops to 0v\n\nAny advise."
