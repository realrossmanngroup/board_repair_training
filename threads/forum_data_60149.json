Have tested the LCD onto another machine and it is working.\n\nVoltage measured on U9000 with LCD connected.\nLCD_IG_PWR_EN :  3.28v\nPP3V3_S5_LCD : 3.28v\nPP3V3_LCDVDD_SW : 0.15v\nResistance mesure at pin 2&3 with LCD : 4.62k\nResistance mesure at pin 2&3 without LCD : 81.7k\n\nHave replaced U9000 twice but PP3V3_LCDVDD_SW still at 0.15v\n\nI think LCD is being detected as testing without the LCD connected, LCD_IG_PWR_EN drops to 0v\n\nAny advise."}
