            "message": "so I spilled a little water on my 2014 MacBook Pro 15\" keyboard, and although the MacBook turns on, the keyboard and trackpad do not work. I do not see any corrosion on those respective connectors, or anywhere on the logic board for that matter. I'm thinking of just replacing the logic board because since I don't see any corrosion on the keyboard/TP connectors, I'm thinking those components are ok. Can water directly hurt the keyboard, or does the damage only happen in the form of shorted or corroded portions of the LB which affect the keyboard/TP?"
