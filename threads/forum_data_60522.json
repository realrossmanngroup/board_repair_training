        "D7005": "What is D7005? a DIODE.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",

        "Q7130": "What is Q7130? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "R5115": "What is R5115? a RESISTOR.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PM_DSW_PWRGD": "What is PM_DSW_PWRGD? The \"PM_DSW_PWRGD\" signal in a MacBook stands for \"Deep Sleep Well Power Good” and is required for the machine to power on & post..",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_SLP_SX_L": "What is PM_SLP_SX_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "R5100": "What is R5100? a RESISTOR.",

        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself.."

AHT test doesn't show any error.\nIt will start as expected automatically with the charger when the battery have been previously disconnected.\nThe problem is the second time when I power off the board with the charger still connected it will not power on after pressing the power button.\n\nI have to disconnect the magsafe and it will power on from the battery when I press power button, if I put back the magsafe it will charge fine but again if I power off and press again the power button it won't start.\n\nThis looked to me initially a piece of cake but now I am completely stumped!\n\nPPBUS is 8,56V without battery charged\n3,42V PP3V42 present\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is a nice 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> is also 3,4V\nI can see <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> going low to 0,4V when I press power button.\n<SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> is also 3.4V and goes low when I press power button.\nResistance between pins 17-18 is 4 ohms and 24ohms between 27-28.\n<RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7006</RESISTOR> are respectively 10 and 5 ohms I get the proper voltage on <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> output either 8.56V either 16.5V\n\nI replaced <DIODE>D7005</DIODE>, replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, replaced <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>, replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR>, reballed original SMC then replaced it twice and still have the same issue...\nTried different keyboard/trackpad original 85w magsafe, I/O board & cable.\nChecked again and compared expected values coming in and out of <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and they check fine.\n\nThe only clue I can tell is that <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is sensitive as soon as I probe it in voltage mode it will trigger the board and it starts, I have no more logical explanation for this as I reballed and changed twice the smc, changed the ISL and checked all traces for <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>. I will try an ultrasonic in case some crap under the cpu.\n\nWhat am I missing or what can I check? I have no more idea and am exhausted on this one.\nThanks:)"
