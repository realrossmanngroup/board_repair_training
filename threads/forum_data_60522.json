        "message":"This logicboard had water damage causing backlight issue, crap near SMC and ISL6259 but no heavy damaged components.\nCleaned everything reflowed SMC to make sure.\n\nAt this point, it boots all ok with battery, it charges when magsafe is plugged in. AHT test doesn't show any error.\nIt will start as expected automatically with the charger when the battery have been previously disconnected.\nThe problem is the second time when I power off the board with the charger still connected it will not power on after pressing the power button.\n\nI have to disconnect the magsafe and it will power on from the battery when I press power button, if I put back the magsafe it will charge fine but again if I power off and press again the power button it won't start.\n\nThis looked to me initially a piece of cake but now I am completely stumped!\n\nPPBUS is 8,56V without battery charged\n3,42V PP3V42 present\nSMC_reset_L is a nice 3.3V\nSMC_ONOFF_L is also 3,4V\nI can see SMC_ONOFF_L going low to 0,4V when I press power button.\nPM_PWRBTN_L is also 3.4V and goes low when I press power button.\nResistance between pins 17-18 is 4 ohms and 24ohms between 27-28.\nR7005 and R7006 are respectively 10 and 5 ohms I get the proper voltage on D7005 output either 8.56V either 16.5V\n\nI replaced D7005, replaced U7100, replaced U5110, replaced Q7180 and Q7130, reballed original SMC then replaced it twice and still have the same issue...\nTried different keyboard\/trackpad original 85w magsafe, I\/O board & cable.\nChecked again and compared expected values coming in and out of U5110 and they check fine.\n\nThe only clue I can tell is that SMC_reset_L is sensitive as soon as I probe it in voltage mode it will trigger the board and it starts, I have no more logical explanation for this as I reballed and changed twice the smc, changed the ISL and checked all traces for SMC_RESET_L. I will try an ultrasonic in case some crap under the cpu.\n\nWhat am I missing or what can I check? I have no more idea and am exhausted on this one.\nThanks:)"
