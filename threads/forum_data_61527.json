COuldr read ROM but couldn't write to ROM with MEdusa so replaced <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> and reprogrammed with new BIOS clean ME. Realized board booted with heat to PCH so reflowed with flux. Board now boots consistently but no wifi. Tried PRAM resets and replacing wifi card with couple other and pram/smc Resets and no change. THere is no card detected in system info.\n\nPlaced original BIOS w/ Clean ME to see if any difference. No change.\n\nNo signs of issues around <CHIP>U3540</CHIP> but replaced.\n\nReadings at <CHIP>U3540</CHIP>:\n1- 3.3V\n2 - 1V\n3- 3.3V\n4 - 3.3V\n5 - 0\n6 - 3.45V\n7 - 0\n8 - 0 \n\nThinking this is a PCH issue... any thoughts?"
