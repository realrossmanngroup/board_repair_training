        "message":"hi, i am just have a problem with this board, no fan spin\n\n\nPP5V_S3 is 5.0V\nPP3V\u00a7_S3 is 3.3V\n\nS5_PWRGD is 3.4V\nPM_SLP_S4_L 3.3V\n\nP5VS3_PGOOD 0V\n\nred on ground i found there(pin 5)  in diode mode 0.091, a good one has there 0.521\n\ni replaced the u7201, no fan spin, on pin 5 now is about 0.521, should be ok.\n\nI replaced a second time to be shure but still the same, pin 5 ok but 0V\n\ni removed R7965 (value is ok) but still u7201 pin 5 0V\n\nR7247, R7256, R7249, R7220, R7221, R7260,R7261, R7216, R7246, R7206,  values ok\n\nVREG 5, VREG 3 is good\n\n\nneed some help please"
