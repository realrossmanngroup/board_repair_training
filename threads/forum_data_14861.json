    "definitions": {
        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7010": "What is D7010? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year retina model macbook pros, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "U7700": "What is U7700? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "DP_INT_HPD": "What is DP_INT_HPD? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",

(original screen quoted as working by customer, plus my known good screen - granted i haven't used it in a while). Relatively new to this so don't have any others to swap with at the mo.\nTried different LVDS cable for shits and giggles but no change.\n\ni realise my issue is that <SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL> (pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR>) is not being pulled to ground and therefore not turning on.  I've replaced the pre and post <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> caps  (<CAPACITOR>C7700</CAPACITOR> & <CAPACITOR>C7701</CAPACITOR>) and the voltage divider to pin 3 as a caution. \n<CHIP>U7700</CHIP> has power pins 5&18 and enable pin 17 but is not pulling pin 11 (SD) to ground. \nForgive my naivity but could i try jumping pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> to ground just to see if it goes further ?\n\nI am rather lost now as to where to follow this - any hints please ?"
