            "message": "Working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that has a headphone issue; the left channel only is very muffled/restricted, as if it's not being boosted/amplified properly. It's at around 10% of normal proper volume. Right channel works great.\n\n1. Already replaced jack.\n2. Replaced <CHIP>U6201</CHIP>, as it had seen liquid.\n3. Line between <CHIP>U6201</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C6300</CAPACITOR> was broken/burned, so repaired that.\n4. Checked and replaced all diodes and filters on the left channel, no change.\n5. Diode readings for L and R channels on J6700 (pins 1/3) are .608.\n\nI've already replaced <CHIP>U6201</CHIP> and continuity is fine from pins 38/40 to L6704 and L6706. L6704 and L6706 replaced just for the hell of it. Also replaced jack to be sure...so I'm totally and utterly lost at this point. I'm sure I'm missing something obvious, but I can't stand small audio issues like this. They always get the best of me.\n\nAny help is appreciated."

It's very similar to when an amp blows/fails, how you can still hear the volume, but it's super low. I hope that makes sense."
