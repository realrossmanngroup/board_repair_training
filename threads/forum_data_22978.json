        "message":"I have this 12 inch 2015 Macbook that had liquid spilled on it and the keyboard flex cable was damaged. The trackpad had lots of corrosion on it but not much on the logic board even though I haven't been able to completely remove the logic board since I'm missing the Y00 driver bit.\nI replaced the keyboard cable, trackpad cable and trackpad but still the keyboard and trackpad are not working. The only thing that changed is that now the power button is working to turn it on and off.\n\nI took a closer look at the trackpad connector on the logic board(J4801) and I noticed there was burned powder next to the connector and after putting some alcohol and cleaning the area I noticed that F4800 was gone and the pads were empty so I assume F4800 was burned off. L4800 and the connector look fine visually.\nI am getting 5v on Pin 24.\n\nI don't have a replacement fuse for it but I ran a jumper so the pads were connected but still the issue remains.\n\nDo you know what else could be causing this?\n\nAlso, I can't find a fuse with the specs of F4800. Does anyone know where I could get this part or can someone in the US sell me a donor board for this model?"
