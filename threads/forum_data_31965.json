F7140 is dead and has 0 Ohm to ground on pin 2 (PPBUS_G3H). I hooked up my lab supply and fed it 1V first, then 1.7. CPU didnt warm up. I eventually ended up at 8V with a 3 amp draw, but couldnt find any component heating up. Is this a short to ground inside the board?"}

There was a crack in C7620 I didnt spot before. Customer actually found it before I got around to trying your trick, duke. I'm surprised it didn't heat up more, I couldnt feel it with my hand. Alcohol barely evaporated faster than on the components around it."}
