I’m not exactly sure what the T-CON board is I feel like this is it from what I gather. I tried a cracked display to see if it would change anything except the two cracked displays I have are insanely cracked so it’s very hard to tell actually more like I see the Apple jumping around on the bottom for what appeared to be very very long, I’m not confident that this is a good test so I would like to do what you’re saying with disconnecting the webcam which I’m having trouble figuring out exactly what it would be I don’t think it’s any of the flexes right? Maybe? Unless I’m wrong so I used the cracked screen as a test to make sure that I could remove the shields without damaging the flexes, if I have to remove the flex I certainly will. But I would like to know that I’m properly doing what you suggest. I guess that’s a long way of saying, What is the T-CON board and which is the webcam?[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60204[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60205[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60206[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60207[/ATTACH]"

Everything related to the keyboard and trackpad appear to work as expected.\nI realized I forgot to mention at the start of everything I did have to swap the headphone Jack board (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01992</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-0) with the exact same board and corresponding flex; as the original had fried the connector on the board/flex on part of it, the whole thing looked kinda bad so I chose to replace it (not sure if this is helpful info).\nAlso I guess I did most of my work here with the battery disconnected and became so engulfed in the temp and slowness, I missed that the battery says “service battery” and that it’s not charging (it does recognize the battery and shows the lightning bolt)  idk if this maybe solely the battery or if it’s related to the issue we’ve been troubleshooting or it’s own separate issue. I’ll order a battery but don’t know if this is necessary to continue troubleshooting the issue at hand."
