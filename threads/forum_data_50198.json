When board first powers on it only uses 339 miliamps for about 20 seconds before turning off but now it turns back on and at starters using 330 amps again but then stays continuously running between 500-600 miliamps. No image on internal or external still.\n\nDo you still need all of those voltages or could this be a bios issue?"}
