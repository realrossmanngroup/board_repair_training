            "message": "Got sort of a perplexing one here; hoping it's not a dead CPU.\n\n1. Board has no history of liquid or drop; previous owner said it simply stopped booting one day.\n2. Board powers on, <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> present and steady (3.3v), VCORE present (~1.19v), CPU gets appropriately warm.\n3. No chime, white sleep light stays on.\n4. No chime even without RAM installed (ugh)\n5. No sign of liquid anywhere at all; no discolored probe points or sign of any residue at all. Very clean.\n6. Replaced BIOS (even though I had no chime w/o RAM, just to see) and replaced Clock. No change.\n\nSince I have <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> and VCORE, I'm not really sure what else to check. Were this one liquid, I wouldn't waste my time, but this one has a seemingly clean past.\n\nAny advice appreciated! Hoping this one isn't a dead CPU; sort of seems like an issue with the MEM circuit; I'll check there next and see what's up, although I thought that since I have <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, my MEM circuit should be all good, correct? Otherwise my <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> would be pulled down, or so I thought. Thanks in advance for any assistance!"
