Board has no history of liquid or drop; previous owner said it simply stopped booting one day.\n2. Board powers on, ALL_SYS_PWRGD present and steady (3.3v), VCORE present (~1.19v), CPU gets appropriately warm.\n3. No chime, white sleep light stays on.\n4. No chime even without RAM installed (ugh)\n5. No sign of liquid anywhere at all; no discolored probe points or sign of any residue at all. Very clean.\n6. Replaced BIOS (even though I had no chime w\/o RAM, just to see) and replaced Clock. No change.\n\nSince I have ALL_SYS_PWRGD and VCORE, I'm not really sure what else to check. Were this one liquid, I wouldn't waste my time, but this one has a seemingly clean past.\n\nAny advice appreciated! Hoping this one isn't a dead CPU; sort of seems like an issue with the MEM circuit; I'll check there next and see what's up, although I thought that since I have ALL_SYS_PWRGD, my MEM circuit should be all good, correct? Otherwise my all_sys_pwrgd would be pulled down, or so I thought. Thanks in advance for any assistance!"}

I doubt this will be worth the time wasted. Most likely PCH or CPU issue, but could be anything else."}

Was hoping it was a simple cap knocked off somewhere, but no dice. Going to call this one a no-fix as I somewhat expected; thanks, Duke!"}
