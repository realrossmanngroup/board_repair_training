Like to <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> 1.1V and off repeatedly! \n\nAlready replace <CHIP>U4700</CHIP> for a new one and no changes! \n\nAny idea to this one?? already searched on forum but i can't find any problem related to this! \n\nthanks"

I can feel the board warm like a working board! \n\nAlready heat the processor a bit, but don't changes! I think the CPU it's damage! \n\nIt's possible on this mode even with damaged processors to recover the information on internal SSD? \n\nOther question its possible to reprogram the bios on this models with TL866 for example ?"

BIOS can be programmed but it is BGA, so you have to remove it, reball, solder to programmer, remove, reball, and resolder without breaking it...better to use something like Medusa to access the BIOS through JTAG connector."
