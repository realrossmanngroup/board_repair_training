        "message":"I have a board here that had a small amount of liquid spill around J8500 . There is a short on F7000. I lifted F7000 and the short is on point 2 of the fuse the opposite side to the U7000 is fine.\nFound  U7210 to be short , replaced .\nBoard now drawing 20v 270ma with no voltage on L7210,L7220.\nL7270 has 1.05v (PPVCCSA_S0_CPU) , cpu is heating up .\nI tried replacing U[U]7100 but still the same.\n\nAny ideas welcome[\/U]"
