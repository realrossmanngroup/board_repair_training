        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1845": "What is U1845? a CHIP.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "P5VS4RS3_PGOOD": "What is P5VS4RS3_PGOOD? P5VS4RS3_PGOOD is a signal that confirms the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail is working properly. .",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process."
