When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

Not chargin it.\n\n\nChecked <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> and 27/28 pins have 20 ohms but 17/18 is going to millions ohms. Already changed <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> with no result.\n\n\nPPBUS ( with only magsafe conecting is 14V than going down untill 2.8V and again 14V and all time like this. When the battery is connected 13.65V stable. \n\n3V42 is present but a little high ( 4V).\n\n\nMy bet is that SMC is bad, but want to ask before changing that shit."
