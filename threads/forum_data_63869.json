The trackpad clicks, fans spin, but nothing else happens. DFU Restore was successful, with Apple logo and progress bar on target machine and padlock on host machine.\n\nI have PPBUS 12.6V, PP3V3_G3H, PP5V_G3S, all AWAKE rails, and the SSD rails. The big coils have similar resistances to ground as on another board. The CPU area gets warm but there is no chime. \n\nAnything else to check before I blame this on a bad U0500?"}
