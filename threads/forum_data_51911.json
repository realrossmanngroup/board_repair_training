Boots up fine, screen is working, just no backlight. When I measure pin 1 of the LVDS connector I get no attempts of producing voltage. There is 5V getting to the chip.There is no enable signal arriving to the chip and no attempt at producing enable signal. When I measure using diode mode on pin 1 of LVDS I get about 1.1V drop. There is no liquid damage."}

I've been testing without the panel attached this whole time. First time encountering non short or corrosion related fault. Is this why I get no enable?"}

Was not repaired as customer didn't want to buy the lcd. For some reason thought the driver would still try running without the LVDS there. Good to know."}
