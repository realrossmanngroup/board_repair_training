        "820-00281": "What is 820-00281? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR? This is the input that comes from the charger..",
        "CHGR_BMON": "What is CHGR_BMON? CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H? This is the input from the USB-C charger or the battery that is the input voltage for the chip responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H. It can be missing when capacitors on this line are shorted to ground, or when the diode in front of it leading to the chip that creates PP3V3_G3H is blown. .",
        "CHGR_AMON": "What is CHGR_AMON? CHGR_AMON provides DC current sense information to the SMC(System management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip). It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",
        "PM_EN_P3V3_G3H": "What is PM_EN_P3V3_G3H? PM_EN_P3V3_G3H is a signal that enables the PP3V3_G3H rail to turn on. This comes out of ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip; when missing, often is missing because of a bad ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip. .",

Every liquid damage indicator on the board is red, but only found corrosion around the backlight circuit and left speaker circuit. Board is using 20v 0.03v when I connect to just the charger. PPBUS starts at 0v when the charger is first connected and then after maybe 30 seconds or so, it starts at about 0.2v and slowly works its way up to around 0.77v and then stays like that steady. I took some measurements and figured it was a <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> issue so I replaced it, but still have the same issue. Took another look over the board an noticed small amount or corrosion on pin 12 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR>. I replaced both <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>, but still same issue. PPBUS is not shorted to ground either (0.383 @ F7000 in diode mode).

            "message": "Well I am still struggling with this one. I have replaced almost every component on page 64 on the schematic, including <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/40 multiple times with the same results. I checked all the traces for each connection and they are fine. I even compared diode mode values on all the pads for <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> with another board and they all match.\n\nI get 19.8v on all pins of <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> and on D1 for <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>. I get 4.8v on <SIGNAL>TBA_BOOT1</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>TBA_BOOT2</SIGNAL> and on a good board I get about 17v on these rails. I also have only 4.4mv on <SIGNAL>TBA_LX1</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>TBA_LX2</SIGNAL>, but diode mode to ground on these rails match my good board. LX1 and LX2 should be 12.6v according to my good board, which is what PPBUS should be, but I still have .7v on PPBUS. Does LX1 and LX2 come from <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> or from <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/40, and what causes BOOT1 and BOOT2 to boost to 17v?"
