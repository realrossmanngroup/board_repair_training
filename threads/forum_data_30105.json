            "message": "This board was liquid damaged with a little bit of damage around the keyboard backlight connector, <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> and the DC-in Board. There isn't any visible damage to the LCD connector I cleaned the area up with some flux and heat but I haven't ultrasonic'd it yet.\nWith a new Dc-in board the board turns on, a USB drive lights up and CPU Vcore is present but nothing appears on the screen.\nWith the lid open I plugged in the charger and measured <RESISTOR>R8319</RESISTOR>/<CAPACITOR>C8319</CAPACITOR> and I got 3.3v on them but only for a few seconds. The same thing happened on L8300. I got around 5v on initial startup but after about 3 seconds it goes back to 0v and the fan continues to spin and everything else continues to run.\n\nUpdate: I have ultrasonic'd the board and the issue still remains."
