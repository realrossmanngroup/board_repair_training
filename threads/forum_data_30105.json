There isn't any visible damage to the LCD connector I cleaned the area up with some flux and heat but I haven't ultrasonic'd it yet.\nWith a new Dc-in board the board turns on, a USB drive lights up and CPU Vcore is present but nothing appears on the screen.\nWith the lid open I plugged in the charger and measured R8319\/C8319 and I got 3.3v on them but only for a few seconds. The same thing happened on L8300. I got around 5v on initial startup but after about 3 seconds it goes back to 0v and the fan continues to spin and everything else continues to run.\n\nUpdate: I have ultrasonic'd the board and the issue still remains."}

Probably corrosion on the connector or board. Ebay and Ali are full of 95% new Chinese junk."}
