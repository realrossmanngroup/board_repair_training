It has 20v and 2-3 amps.\nAll normal, but i get the \"no entry sign\" flashing. I can't enter internet recovery or anything.\nIt does go into DFU mode and I tried to revive and restore it with another mac but it always goes in that \"no entry sign\" and it flashes that for a while until it reboots itself.\nI am stuck. I don't think its hardware related (but i could be wrong). I think I got a logic board that's new and needs to be initialized or something. (that's all i can think of).\nDoes anyone have any experience with this?\nThank you in advance."

When I got it it came in a weird box with good packaging and a weird serial number and other numbers.\nIt also had weird brackets holding the sides on the board. \n\nYes, I did. It doesn't go into recovery mode at all. \nNeither in Target disk mode. The keyboard is working because SMC reset works and DFU mode works. \nI try to boot off a USB and nothing happens. \nIt's just strange. Is there anything else I can try?\nThanks again for your help :)"
