        "message":"I have a 2014 model a1398 got liquid spilled, video distortion , spilled a bit every where. cleaned ,replaced screen top\nall runs good except the sound.\n\nthe internal speakers don't work, initially, the volume was grey color, then plug in a headphone, and unplug, the speakers work for few seconds then same thing again.\n\nthe audio circuit was spilled, so I replace the entire BGA audio chip from another donor board, but still same thing now. no internal speakers.\n\ndevice sound output shows\"headphone\" even nothing is plugged in , and yes it works with the headphone plugged in.\n\n\ni just want a simple quick fix to solve this. is there resistors i can just remove, so to disable the \"function of the jack\" so the internal speaker can work?(even without the headphone function,it should be fine with customers) of course if anything that can fix it completely, that would be better.\n\nI do doubt if it's the jack itself, it looks completely fine, anydi don't want to heat that up to mess the whole jack and replace, since the sound IC i just reballed is so close to it, took quite some time to reball and install"

Not really very convincing measurement. \n\nI also verified the diode measurements with L6608 removed. One side is 750ish and the other is 1750. Seems in the same ball park as your measurement as they kinda vary between meters.\n\nI really have no ideas right now. Can you make a good high-res picture of the area? Check traces to C6222 they are common to corrode too."
