I ultrasonic cleaned and reaplced both bad <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> and now computer is turning on.  everything is working execpt there is no sound.  sound is being detected in system prefs but sound is coming out of speakers.  i found a couple of shorts around <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> so i removed it and shorts went away.  replaced it and all is good, but still not getting sound.  the only issue is a short to ground on <SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_RL_MODE</SIGNAL>.  i replaced <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> again and replaced <RESISTOR>R6481</RESISTOR> but still same issue.  if i remove the resistor the short to ground goes away. i  am at a loss on this.  did i get 2 bad chips?  is this suppose to show short to ground?. i don't think so becuase <SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_FL_MODE</SIGNAL> is not on <CHIP>U6450</CHIP> side."
