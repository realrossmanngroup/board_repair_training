Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

I have read in some forums some people having the same issue but they could power on without having the battery connected my laptop will not power on with battery connected or if battery is disconnected. I was going to attempt to find a short on the logic board so I purchased a usb-c volt and amp reader and it appears as if I’m getting normal power to the laptop 20v’s and amps vary. So I’m thinking I’m not seeing a short in the logic board could it be that I may have a defective power button? I’m not sure any thoughts on what I should try next?"
