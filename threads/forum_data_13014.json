No physical signs at all.\n\nNo light on USB mouse.\nvcore good.\n\nTried another BIOS chip and got chime, USB mouse light up but nothing on screen. Noticed my error (did not read the board number properly and stuck a 3330 chips on) so put a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> BIOS chip on there, back to no chime no light on USB mouse.... Guess it's not the chip then.\n\nWhat to check for please?"

Yes tried another screen / cable.\n\nTried 2 other BIOS chips from <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> boards and both result in no chime...\nOnly thing I can guess is that the wrong BIOS is not checking for something that the correct one is and so POST hangs for one and not the other but that is just an uneducated guess. Truth be told I have no fucking clue what's going on here."
