        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",

The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely.

            "message": "Hi all,\n\nThis is my first board repair, I am not a professional and just a hobbyist.  Possibly some typos as I am going off my written notes from a week ago.\n\nHistory:\nCorona free macbook.\nI was gifted the machine.  It had a bullet hole through the screen and was crusty with dirt and pubes on the inside.  Cleaned up nicely, no obvious corrosion.  I spend an hour examining under the magnifying glass before I cleaned it up, after testing.\n\nI have the screen if anyone wants to see a pic of the hole (bullet hole to be clear).\n\nBoard symptom:\nQuater fan spin, no vcore.  some voltages pulsing with the fan (see further down)\n\nWhat I have done:\nI replaced <CAPACITOR>C1724</CAPACITOR> +1723 and <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>.  I measured the resistor incorrectly, but I did a passable replacement job, not completely new to soldering and heat gun work.  Essentially replaced as I am a moron.\n\nMeasurements:\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING</SIGNAL> - 12.6v (good?)\nCPU Vcore - dead, no pulsing with the fan.\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> - Pulses with fan spin.\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - Dead\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_SO_AXG</SIGNAL> - Dead\nPP1V2-<SIGNAL>S3_ENET_INTR</SIGNAL> - Pulses with fan.\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> - Pulses with Fan\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.48V\nPPBUSG3H - 12.6V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> - 3.32V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - Dead\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0</SIGNAL> - Pulses on fan spin\nPP5VS3 - Pulses on fan spin\n\nI Probably over measured, but I wanted the practice on the book of mac.\n\nAssumption (probably wrong - noob):\nThinking I need to concentrate on <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> or <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> any ideas how I test these better?\n<CHIP>U7000</CHIP> I see 3.1 ohms between 17 & 18 i did see elsewhere that it probably should be 2.2ish.\n\n\n\nNeed tips on where I go next, please.  I really am a noob at this.\n\nThanks\nDQ from Australia."

My initial measure of <SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> was a regular spike with the fan, with my crappy multimeter was reading a 1.5vish spike with the fan.\n\nDiode mode to ground on L7100 gives me 0.016 \n\nCaveat; I need better optics, I have a magnifying glass with a light, but I have something better on the way.  Nothing like what the pros use though, but it should give me better vision.\n<CHIP>U7100</CHIP> \nPin 7 - <SIGNAL>VCCSAS0_SREF</SIGNAL> - pulses to about 1.5 . again a slow multi.\nPin 15 - <SIGNAL>PVCCSA_EN</SIGNAL> - Looks like it pulses to about 3.8\nPin 19 - <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_VCCSAS0_VCC</SIGNAL> - Pulses 80-100mv and over and then slowly (ish) drops back to 0 before the next pulse, again.\nPin 20 - PP5VS0 - Pulses with the fan and drains.
