            "message": "Hello guys,\n\nI have a board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A with strange behavior. When connected to the charger (board on the working bench), fan immediately starts spinning at full speed.\nInvestigating different power rails I found out there is no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> and I also found that I do have <SIGNAL>PMP_SLP_S3_BUF_L</SIGNAL> = 3.32V.\nI also have <SIGNAL>P3V3S0_EN_D</SIGNAL> = 3.27V, but <SIGNAL>P3V3S0_EN</SIGNAL> is 0.27V. This means there is no enable signal to open load switch to supply 3.3V in S0.\n\nI have tested the diode: <DIODE>D8184</DIODE> and it seems good (diode mode on digital multimeter shows 212 when red lead is connected to anode). I have also checked capacitor <CAPACITOR>C8186</CAPACITOR> to groaund (resistance and diode mode) and I have the following: 707 in diode mode and about 800 Ohms in resistance mode.\n\nWhen charger is connected I have 3.27 V on <RESISTOR>R8186</RESISTOR> pin 1, and 0.27V on pin 2 against ground.\nWhen power is disconnected I measure 18 kOhm on this resistor  <RESISTOR>R8186</RESISTOR> (red probe on pin 1, black on pin 2) and 13.6 kOhms (red probe on pin 2), but this is not unexpected because Ithere are other components in parallel (including diode).\n\nI really don't understand what could be the problem. If <CAPACITOR>C8186</CAPACITOR> is shorted there would not be 0.27V on pin 1 against ground.\nAlso <RESISTOR>R8186</RESISTOR> seems normal.\n\nI thought, it could be some kind of partial short further on <SIGNAL>S0_EN</SIGNAL> line, but in diode mode measured on test point near NO STUFF <RESISTOR>R8070</RESISTOR>, I have 585 reading against the ground, so here is not shorted"
