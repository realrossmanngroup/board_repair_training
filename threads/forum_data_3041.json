Do you have 3.3 volts on power button , (please press and check if the voltage drops)\nif you have then 3v 5v regulator is most likely working . if you do not have then you need to check the 3v 5v regulator .\n\n\n2. In case  you have the 3.3 volts on power button and the voltage drops when you press it  then you need to check Sio for rms rst and plt rst voltages on Sio .\n  \n if sio is good then rsm rst should come out when you press power button .\n\n\n        please check this and update , if you have voltage on power button try  RE PROGRAM BIOS IC    ) . thanks"
