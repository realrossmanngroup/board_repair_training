        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "R7551": "What is R7551? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_TDO": "What is SMC_TDO? SMC_TDO is a signal that must be pulled up to 3.42v in order for the SMC to be in the proper mode to function. Often this is not pulled up because of corrosion or corroded resistors by the SMC. .",
        "SMS_INT_L": "What is SMS_INT_L? a SIGNAL.",

        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",

I dont have donor board with another SMC, hope its something else..."

            "message": "ur great! i checked them, there was corrosion on <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> and gate, on pin 1, its funny cause i checked it under the scope, but i was using an ext. led light which creates shadows on the board, the water damage was so small that it was hiding in the shadow created by the directional led light, i replaced that, was still no good, than just for the sake of it i replaced <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> (creating 3.3V and 5V) and it started. Did not recognise battery, i could not perform pram reset only smc reset, but pram reset is possible with ext. usb keyboard, and after that it recognized the battery and charging, and now i can perform pram reset with its own keyboard.\nTHX!!"
