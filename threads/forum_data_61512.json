Got this piece of shit here that costumer says data is crucial for him, but I'm suspecting as always on this model to be a bad CPU. Problem is the board powers on, draws around 300mA from charger out of the case, connected directly to genuine 96W power supply but has no POST\/Image. Sometimes board stops turning on and will only power again after some time sitting on the bench disconnected from energy. Where can I start? I have no experience with this boards and am completely lost."}
