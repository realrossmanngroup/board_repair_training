        "A1990": "What is A1990? A1990 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2018, 2019 with EMC3215, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01041, 820-01814..",
        "820-01041": "What is 820-01041? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD": "What is PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD? PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing chip. When this is missing, either a capacitor on the line has shorted, PP3V3_G3H is missing, or the CD3215 is bad..",
        "PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA": "What is PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA? This is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad. Each CD3215 in the system needs to be functioning in order for any of them to speak to the charger and negotiate receiving 20v from the charger rather than the default 5v that a USB-C charger puts out before communicating with the system. .",

        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V2_AWAKE": "What is PP1V2_AWAKE? The PP1V2_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides 1.2 volts and is associated with the machine's awake state and is used for powering the T2 chip..",

Previously it was having liquid damage one <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> and both ports were burnt out. After replacement of both port and one <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>, it started working and i was getting 20V and normal current without battery. But after some one of the new Port burnt out suddenly and damaged again one more <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>. then i realised that that port were faulty and found one more faulty in the same lot i ordered from supplier. Again i did replacement of <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>. before that replacement, behaviour of three port was similar except this. i was getting <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> on three port but not on that i replaced later. \n\nBut after that i am not getting <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>. it shows 5.14V on all ports. But i am getting PP3V3G3H from all ports. \none more thing that i wants to highlights, two of the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> has C00 number in last and other two has B03.  Does it make any difference?\n\nwhat else do i need to check?\n\nThanks"
