Previously it was having liquid damage one CD3215 and both ports were burnt out. After replacement of both port and one CD3215, it started working and i was getting 20V and normal current without battery. But after some one of the new Port burnt out suddenly and damaged again one more CD3215. then i realised that that port were faulty and found one more faulty in the same lot i ordered from supplier. Again i did replacement of CD3215. before that replacement, behaviour of three port was similar except this. i was getting PPBUS_G3H on three port but not on that i replaced later. \n\nBut after that i am not getting PPDCIN_G3H. it shows 5.14V on all ports. But i am getting PP3V3G3H from all ports. \none more thing that i wants to highlights, two of the CD3215 has C00 number in last and other two has B03.  Does it make any difference?\n\nwhat else do i need to check?\n\nThanks"}
