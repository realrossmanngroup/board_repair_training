Came in with water damage but working apart from a few keys.\n\nNo obvious signs on the board so just swapped the faulty keyboard. After fitting the board back to check if the new keyboard is okay, I get no fan spin or anything.\n\nIve checked a few rails with my limited knowledge and get the following\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.57v\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 16.6v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.41v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>   5v\n​<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>  0v\n​<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>  0v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>  3.3v\n\nNot sure if I've missed a rail to check but the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> @ 12.57v when it should be 8.6v doesn't look good. And the DCIN @ 16.6v is a bit low.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nSorry for the noob first post if its missing obvious stuff."

So connected up a screen and it fired up.\n\nThe fan doesn't come on when the DC is plugged in, or when the machine is first turned on like others, but it does spin up once it gets warm so I'm assuming this is normal for this board."
