            "message": "Hello. Got this board here with liquid damage on the area shown in the attached pic. It had heavy corrosion on that area, which I cleaned with flux and heat and then alcohol. The board started negotiating 20V with the charger and the board partially turned on but was shutting down after some seconds with no image on screen. After inspection I found <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD1</SIGNAL> was shorted to GND. I found the short, cleaned it and the board started in T2 recovery mode. I revived the device. After that the machine shut down and I turned it on again, it stayed in S0 state for a couple of seconds and died. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> got low impedance, around 55OHMS, almost shorted. I replaced <CAPACITOR>C6525</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C6555</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C6566</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C6553</CAPACITOR> as they were looking very bad but still no luck. Any ideas on how to find this partial short?"
