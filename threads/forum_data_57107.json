            "message": "Hello,\n\nFirst off, I am complete novice on these new models so apologies for that.\nNow this board had liquid damaged around <CHIP>U1200</CHIP> and the battery.\nOnce cleaned some tissue paper, I can't really any corrosion, as if no components were touched by water.\nThe battery however had stains of liquid on some resistors.\n\nCustomer said the MacBook did turn off while running after the liquid spill happened.\n\nI have <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> with a nice 12.6V and obviously a good 19.6V.\nOne thing that I've noticed is when I plug the charger, I am getting a spike to 0.25amp while being at 5V as if there was a short circuit. (unsure as I don't know the behavior of these 2018 board)\nThen it jumps to 19.6V and draw, 0.4amp, then 0.6amp, then 0.12amp, then 0.16amp and back to 0.01amp and dies.\nVoltage stays at 19.6V but amperage is at 0V.\n\n<SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> is not pulsing at all.\nI've checked some rails around <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> and I am getting almost all of them with the exception of PPVCCPRIMCORE_PRIM_REG\nThere is a 47ohms resistance to ground on this rail so that seems fair for a 1.05V rail.\n\nI don't really know where to start looking now. Any hint please?"
