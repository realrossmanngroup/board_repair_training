        "message":"Having a no backlight issue on a 820-3476 board after liquid spill. No corrosion was present on the board as it was a really recent liquid spill. Cleaned the liquid spill residue, have chime and video signal but no backlight. \n\nThe fuse is good.\n\nI'm getting 0V on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT\n\nWhen I test using diode mode... (red probe on ground and black on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT on the LCD connector) I get 1.180 without the display plugged in, and 0.009 when the display is plugged in..\n\nPlease excuse my lack of experience, but that does that mean my display is bad? \nAlso isn't the diode mode measurement on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT supposed to be .5something if there are no issues with the backlight circuit? \nI'm currently diagnosing it so if anybody has an answer please let me know."
