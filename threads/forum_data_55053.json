There was corrosion on L5001 which resulted in loss of pads, had to run a wire to <RESISTOR>R5193</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R5177</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R5178</RESISTOR>. Before I repaired traces I powered on board and got fan spin. After I get intermittent light but PPBUS is 8.18V. I checked SDA/SCL and they are at 3.3V. Is the next logical step to go after the SMC? I tried a gentle reflow but that didn't change anything. I'm wondering if I should just reball it."
