I got in an 820-00165 with what I thought was no backlight, turns out there is no image. Looks like I am missing EDP_PANEL_PWR which is at 0 volts. This board had some corrosion around the SMC as well as broken traces. Wouldn't Power on at all until I repaired all of the damage. When I plug in a USB Pen drive I get a solid light and nothing else. also nothing from external monitor via TB."}
