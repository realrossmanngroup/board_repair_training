Looks like I am missing <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL> which is at 0 volts. This board had some corrosion around the SMC as well as broken traces. Wouldn't Power on at all until I repaired all of the damage. When I plug in a USB Pen drive I get a solid light and nothing else. also nothing from external monitor via TB."
