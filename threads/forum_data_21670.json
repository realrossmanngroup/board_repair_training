If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

I haven't worked with this model yet so I'm not sure of it's unique characteristics.\n\nI can see an image on the screen if a flashlight is pointed at the back of the screen. Computer starts normally and chimes and external video works via the DisplayPort.\nI checked F7700 and it was blown.  LCI is red under LCD connector and there was some charring evidence on the underside of the logic board below where the LCD connector sits. No other corrosion is visible on either side of the board.\n\nI replaced the fuse and connected the display again. No backlight so I checked the fuse again and it was blown again.  I replaced the fuse again and this time also replaced the LCD connector.  I powered it on again to test without the display connected.  The fuse did not blow this time. I connected the display and powered up again. Still no backlight, but the fuse is not blown. Must have been some corrosion under the LCD connector that was shorting. I made some measurements on these components:\n\n<RESISTOR>R7700</RESISTOR> pins 1 & 2 12.6V\n12.5v on pins 3 & 4\n\n<RESISTOR>R7701</RESISTOR> pin 1 12.5v\npin 2 12.6v\n\n<CAPACITOR>C7700</CAPACITOR> pin 1 12.6v\npin 2 11.6v\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> pin 1 0v\npin 2 0v\n3 11.6v\n4 12.5v\n5 0v\n6 0v\n\n<CAPACITOR>C7701</CAPACITOR> pin 1 0v\npin 2 11.6\n\n<CHIP>U7701</CHIP>\n1 0v\n2 0v\n3 0v\n4 0v\n5 4.9v\n6 4.9v\n8 5v\n9 12.7v\n10 12.7v\n11 11.1v\n12 0v\n13 0v\n14 0v\n15 0v\n16 0v\n17 3.2v\n18 4.9v\n19 0v\n20 0v\n21 0v\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  I don't have another exact LCD panel to swap out, but I do have a 2015 Retina display. Would that work with this model?"

All checked out with their correct values.  I have a 2013 LCD panel on the way for testing.  I was thinking of injecting 12.6v at pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C7701</CAPACITOR>. Not sure if that will blow anything up and want to proceed with caution.  Anyone? anyone?"

            "message": "Don't do that. There is a reason the transistor is not opening. You have to have a known good LCD for testing, even if cracked, just something you know can produce an image/backlight on a known good. This machine has current sensing after the fuse, <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> won't open if there is large voltage difference between <RESISTOR>R7700</RESISTOR> input/output so that the circuit doesn't go on fire(about time Apple). My guess is it senses a short to ground on output when the LCD is plugged in most likely something inside the LCD cable. 99% of the backlight problems on this model are LCD or LCD cable or connector, not backlight circuit related itself. It's much less prone to failure due to the fact that it is hidden away from where the water lands."

Inspect cable and replace.\n\nI also suspect you did the measurements on the backlight circuit without an LCD connected, so that is all moot."

            "message": "OK. an update on my no backlight issue.  I bought a known good testing LCD panel for this model late-2013 Retina that arrived today.  This computer arrived with no backlight but the external display port works normally and there is an image on the screen that can be seen with a  flashlight.  The LCI was red under the LCD connector and there was evidence of a short that happened under the connector. The fuse F7700 was also blown.  I replaced the LCD connector and F7700 and checked for short to ground on the connector pins and components along the backlight circuit.  I tried out the newly acquired test LCD panel and have the same results,  no backlight but an image on the screen.\n\nI measured around <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> again and I see that I have no <SIGNAL>EDP_IG_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL> or <SIGNAL>EDP_IG_BKL_ON</SIGNAL> coming into pin 17 EN.  I chased that path back through <RESISTOR>R1284</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R1281</RESISTOR> and back to <CHIP>U1100</CHIP>.  Nothing is being output from <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> on that signal.  I also checked <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> for short to ground and have 0v on pin 1, 5v on pins 2,3 0v on 4, 5\n\nIs this repair hopeless since this chip is not sending the correct signal to enable <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>?"
