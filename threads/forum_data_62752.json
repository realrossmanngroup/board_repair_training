        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",

This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures.

Changed the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> with another one (ordered from ALI so not sure it was good) but still no 20v. Checked further and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was 6v. After further inspection saw that another <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> (cd3215c00) was getting very hot. So changed that to and now I have 12,3V <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> but still no 20v and no PP1v1 ldo BMC on <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>/<CHIP>U3100</CHIP> and UB400 (while connect on the corresponding port) Only on UB300...\n\nI used like 3 other CD3215C00 chips all no bmc. Then I found a donor board with working 20v cd3215c00 chips. Got them off en reballed and still no BMC. So I know for SURE it can't be bad batch of <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>. I read on this forum something about changing the TBT rom, I have a lot of donors but never did a ROM backup. (don't know how) and don't want to before im sure that could be my issue. \n\nHere are my readings:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12,3v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> 3,3v\n\n<CHIP>U3200</CHIP> \n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC</SIGNAL> LDO BMC 0,484\nPP1v8 LDOA 0.513\nPP1v8 LDOD 0.470\nPP3v3 LDO 0.459\n\n<CHIP>U3100</CHIP>\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC</SIGNAL> LDO BMC 0,491\nPP1v8 LDOA 0.505\nPP1v8 LDOD 0.471\nPP3v3 LDO 0.467\n\nUB300\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC</SIGNAL> LDO BMC 0,507\nPP1v8 LDOA 0.517\nPP1v8 LDOD 0.481\nPP3v3 LDO 0.496\n\nUB400\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC</SIGNAL> LDO BMC 0,498\nPP1v8 LDOA 0.510\nPP1v8 LDOD 0.476\nPP3v3 LDO 0.490\n\nPlease let me know if you need more info...\n\nThere is no power cycling, all ports stay at 5v and 0,35a"
