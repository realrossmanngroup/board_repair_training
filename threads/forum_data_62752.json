So thought easy peasy. Changed the cd3215 U3200 with another one (ordered from ALI so not sure it was good) but still no 20v. Checked further and ppbus_g3h was 6v. After further inspection saw that another U3100 (cd3215c00) was getting very hot. So changed that to and now I have 12,3V PPBUS_G3H but still no 20v and no PP1v1 ldo BMC on u3200\/u3100 and UB400 (while connect on the corresponding port) Only on UB300...\n\nI used like 3 other CD3215C00 chips all no bmc. Then I found a donor board with working 20v cd3215c00 chips. Got them off en reballed and still no BMC. So I know for SURE it can't be bad batch of cd3215. I read on this forum something about changing the TBT rom, I have a lot of donors but never did a ROM backup. (don't know how) and don't want to before im sure that could be my issue. \n\nHere are my readings:\n\nPPBUS_g3h 12,3v\nPP3v3_G3h 3,3v\n\nU3200 \nPP1v1_UPC LDO BMC 0,484\nPP1v8 LDOA 0.513\nPP1v8 LDOD 0.470\nPP3v3 LDO 0.459\n\nU3100\nPP1v1_UPC LDO BMC 0,491\nPP1v8 LDOA 0.505\nPP1v8 LDOD 0.471\nPP3v3 LDO 0.467\n\nUB300\nPP1v1_UPC LDO BMC 0,507\nPP1v8 LDOA 0.517\nPP1v8 LDOD 0.481\nPP3v3 LDO 0.496\n\nUB400\nPP1v1_UPC LDO BMC 0,498\nPP1v8 LDOA 0.510\nPP1v8 LDOD 0.476\nPP3v3 LDO 0.490\n\nPlease let me know if you need more info...\n\nThere is no power cycling, all ports stay at 5v and 0,35a"}
