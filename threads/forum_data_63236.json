I found a 60-70 Ohm short to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>. When I inject 3.3V into <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> (after removal of fuse <RESISTOR>R6923</RESISTOR>), I get 20V on all ports. But the current is only around 100mA, not enough to heat up any component. How do I find the short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>?"
