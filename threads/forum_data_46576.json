        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

After few restarts and sitting around for a bit NO trackpad again! It doesnt seem to have any corrosion oh water damage.\n\nim not sure what the best way to diagnose these issues.\n\nI have taken some voltages from around trackpad connector.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4_TPAD_F</SIGNAL> 5.19v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> 3.33v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_PME_S4_WAKE_L</SIGNAL> 3.297v\n<SIGNAL>TPAD_SPI_IF_EN_CONN</SIGNAL> 3.33v\n\nWhere is good place to start looking?"
