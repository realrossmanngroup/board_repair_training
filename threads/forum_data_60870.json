Already changed <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> just in case but no difference. When I remove <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is 0v, but when <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> is in place I only get .062V can that be caused by PCH? Should I inject voltage on <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> rail?\nIf I inject voltage on that rail, how many mili amps should I use?\n\nin SMC bypass mode I get fan spin, but no <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, maybe bad SMC?\n\nThanks!"
