Already changed Q8150 just in case but no difference. When I remove U1950 all_sys_pwrgd is 0v, but when U1950 is in place I only get .062V can that be caused by PCH? Should I inject voltage on all_sys_pwrgd rail?\nIf I inject voltage on that rail, how many mili amps should I use?\n\nin SMC bypass mode I get fan spin, but no all_sys_pwrgd, maybe bad SMC?\n\nThanks!"}
