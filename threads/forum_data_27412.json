When connecting the charger I get a green light but no orange. Fan spins for a second and stop and restarts every few seconds. When connecting only a battery light goes off and the same happens.\n\nPPBUS_G3H  =   16.54\nPP3V42_G3H =   3.43 (Also on SMC_BC_ACOK, 3.43 goes to adapter)\nPP5V_S5 = 5v\nPP5V_S3 = pulsing 0-5v\nPP3v3_S5  = 3.34\nPP3v3_S4  =  3.34 pulsing\nPPVCC_S0_CPU = no CPU VCore\nALL_SYS_PWRGD = pulsing from 0-3.3v\n\nI have a short to ground on L7520. Since there was liquid near the PCH could it be crap under the PCH?"}
