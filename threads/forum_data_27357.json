Has 3v3 on L7560. Has 3.3V on both sides of R1300\/1\/2\/3. I've checked as much as I can think of. I've attached pre-ultrasonic pics. I've removed and resoldered all of the components in the spill area. I replaced U1900 and a few others that got hit harder just in case. Not sure where to go next."}

Would your next move be to pull it and reball it or is there something else I should try before that?"}

There was corrosion under there for sure. Of course check all resistors\/traces in those 2 corrosion spots too."}
