Has 3.3V on both sides of <RESISTOR>R1300</RESISTOR>/1/2/3. I've checked as much as I can think of. I've attached pre-ultrasonic pics. I've removed and resoldered all of the components in the spill area. I replaced <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> and a few others that got hit harder just in case. Not sure where to go next."
