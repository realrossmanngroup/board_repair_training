Shit ton of flux around the GPU\n\nBeen wokring on it for 15 minutes and I'm already to the point of giving up, probably the GPU is shorting something or messing something up.\n\nPPVCORE_GPU <0.4Ohm (I don't think my multimeter can measure any lower)\nRemoving R8940, PPVCORE_GPU_REG_R stays 0V.\n\nWhere to look? Is there some part I'm overlooking or should I just trash it already?\n\nCheers"}

You can pull the GPU, these board will power on and chime without. No video of course..."}
