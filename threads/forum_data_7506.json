This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

I had no idea this board could boot up and work seemingly fine (other than theses issues) without <SIGNAL>3V3_S4</SIGNAL>. It was at about 2V. <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> trace was blown up at <RESISTOR>R8115</RESISTOR>. I ran <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> across the board from <RESISTOR>R1460</RESISTOR> and everything's working great now. Thanks again.[/FONT]"
