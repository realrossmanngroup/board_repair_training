I'm having trouble finding the USB chip that controls all of this (or at least TP\/KB\/BT.) Does anyone know which chip it is on this model? I've scoured the schematic back and forth and am not seeing that central chip like the U2700 on the older 820-3115 boards."

I had no idea this board could boot up and work seemingly fine (other than theses issues) without 3V3_S4. It was at about 2V. PM_SLP_S5_L trace was blown up at R8115. I ran PM_SLP_S5_L across the board from R1460 and everything's working great now. Thanks again.[\/FONT]"
