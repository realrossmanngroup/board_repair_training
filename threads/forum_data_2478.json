            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nHaving UC this one (was pretty messed up) I replaced <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> and got a green light (at least thats how I remember it and in a hurry noted on paper - since this board was written off for a couple of months) but the system is still dead.\n\nMeasuring around I discovered that my <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was 1,2V, measured around a bit more and I decided to replace the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> which brought the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> to 4,12V (I should have kept measuring as you ll read further down).\n\nL6995 measures 0,070 in diode mode but when removed the right side (pin1) measures 0,58x. I thought maybe there is a short somewhere and I applied 1V as per Louis ([URL=\"http://advancedreworks.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-1476.html\"]http://advancedreworks.com/forum/arc...hp/t-1476.html[/URL]) on the 0,070 side (brain activity has considerably slowed down by now) but nothing gets really hot and thats expected from a few milliamps draw.\n\nEDIT: as per this thread: \"https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/1013-mbp-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-with-short-to-ground-on-<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>-and-no-orange-or-green-light\" I must inject 3.4V which also makes sense - will do this and come back soon. Please read on...\n\nF7040 diode mode is 0,434.\n\nFinally a few minutes ago I just measured short (diode mode 000) at pin2 of ALL THREE L7510, L7520, L7550 (raised one side from the pad with the soldering iron). Is the CPU fried? Should I inject voltage here?\n\nShould I just name this sucker \"donor\"?\n\nThanks for any input guys.\n\nGeorge"
