            "message": "Hi Guys,\n\nGot this 15 Macbook which had liquid damage. Quite extensive around the <CHIP>U9080</CHIP>, <CHIP>U4900</CHIP>\n\nAfter cleaning the area I have discovered that I get dead short 0.66Ohm on L9081 <SIGNAL>P2V5_SW2_TPS62180_SSD0</SIGNAL>\nThe other output of <CHIP>U9080</CHIP> -  L9080 <SIGNAL>P2V5_SW1_TPS62180_SSD0</SIGNAL> is reporting 2.08 MOhm - 0.44 Diode. These measures are with removed L9080/1 coils\n\n<SIGNAL>P2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> is 1.30 Ohm\n\n<CHIP>U9080</CHIP> is heating up, which perhaps is explained by the short.\n\nI lifted up <RESISTOR>R5600</RESISTOR>, thinking it may be the only G3H feeding the <CHIP>U9080</CHIP>.\nWhen lifted up, <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> heats up (up to 60*C) together with <CHIP>U8800</CHIP>/8700\n\nThen, I lifted up <RESISTOR>R5620</RESISTOR> too and managed to get 20V 0.4A on the charger.\n\nis this dead <CHIP>TPS62180</CHIP>? Or is there a possibility <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> to be busted too? Which doesn't seem to be available anywhere?\n\nRegards\n\n\n\nSeems like need to order it and wait 2 weeks, and was wondering if there anything else I can check before I fix this short?"
