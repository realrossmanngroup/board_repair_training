        "message":"Hi Guys,\n\nGot this 15 Macbook which had liquid damage. Quite extensive around the U9080, U4900\n\nAfter cleaning the area I have discovered that I get dead short 0.66Ohm on L9081 P2V5_SW2_TPS62180_SSD0\nThe other output of U9080 -  L9080 P2V5_SW1_TPS62180_SSD0 is reporting 2.08 MOhm - 0.44 Diode. These measures are with removed L9080\/1 coils\n\nP2V5_NAND_SSD0 is 1.30 Ohm\n\nU9080 is heating up, which perhaps is explained by the short.\n\nI lifted up R5600, thinking it may be the only G3H feeding the U9080.\nWhen lifted up, U9000 heats up (up to 60*C) together with U8800\/8700\n\nThen, I lifted up R5620 too and managed to get 20V 0.4A on the charger.\n\nis this dead TPS62180? Or is there a possibility U9000 to be busted too? Which doesn't seem to be available anywhere?\n\nRegards\n\n\n\nSeems like need to order it and wait 2 weeks, and was wondering if there anything else I can check before I fix this short?"
