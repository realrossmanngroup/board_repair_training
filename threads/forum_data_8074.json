I've looked over the board and don't see liquid damage (doesn't look like it's been cleaned either)\n\nUsually I would run ASD to see if it fails any sensors, but I don't have an ASD for the 2015 air, and what I was reading online is that Apple has gone remote\/GSX for their \"ASD\" for the newest machines.\n\nCan anyone confirm this or know what would cause (I'm sure there are a thousand things) the fans to run on high?\n\nThanks!"}

If the computer works this well, other than fan, would you suspect a bad SMC? PPN001 power management, I did just see some corrosion on the I\/O board. Don't have a spare. Could an I\/O board be causing all of this. The 820-00165-A looks super clean (there was some dust, etc... so I don't think it was cleaned)\n\nthanks again"}
