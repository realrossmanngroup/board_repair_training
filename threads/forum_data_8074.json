            "message": "I have a 2015 MacBook Air that runs \"fine\" other than the fan runs high as soon as you turn it on.\n\nWhen it boots, Keyboard, trackpad, wifi, Bluetooth, etc.. all work the way they should (and doesn't seem to be running slowly.) I've looked over the board and don't see liquid damage (doesn't look like it's been cleaned either)\n\nUsually I would run ASD to see if it fails any sensors, but I don't have an ASD for the 2015 air, and what I was reading online is that Apple has gone remote/GSX for their \"ASD\" for the newest machines.\n\nCan anyone confirm this or know what would cause (I'm sure there are a thousand things) the fans to run on high?\n\nThanks!"
