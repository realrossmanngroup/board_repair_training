            "message": "I need some logic board repair advice, I am repairing an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00281</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that showed no ssd (soldered to board), and I ended up finding what the problem was, some liquid got on <CAPACITOR>C8784</CAPACITOR> and removed the <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SSD_FMC</SIGNAL> pad (pad 1). I looked up the capacitor in the schematic PDF file and it shares <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SSD_FMC</SIGNAL> with <CAPACITOR>C8783</CAPACITOR>, 82, 81, 80. If I ran a wire from <CAPACITOR>C8782</CAPACITOR> to <CAPACITOR>C8784</CAPACITOR>, would this complete the circuit? Correct me if im wrong\n\nI provided photos too"
