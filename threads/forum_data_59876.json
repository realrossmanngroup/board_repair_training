If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC.

I can do pram for 1 chime then I believe the keyboard is turning off and after boot no keyboard or trackpad again.\n\nWhat in boot cycle would kick on that might supercede keyboard and controller? I reflowed the SMC also. Also noticed if I leave the external display kicked in with lid open it doesn't turn the backlight or display on at all."
