I can do pram for 1 chime then I believe the keyboard is turning off and after boot no keyboard or trackpad again.\n\nWhat in boot cycle would kick on that might supercede keyboard and controller? I reflowed the SMC also. Also noticed if I leave the external display kicked in with lid open it doesn't turn the backlight or display on at all."}
