        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "U7080": "What is U7080? a CHIP.",
        "U7085": "What is U7085? a CHIP.",
        "Q7030": "What is Q7030? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",
        "R5087": "What is R5087? a RESISTOR."

I've run a number of wires to repair the charging-sense lines. Replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7085</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7080</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> and all charging-sense resistors. The main 18.5V DC line cycles up and down from 1.8V up to an unknown number. No magsafe light. No known shorts. I've been digging through the Inrush Limiter and Reverse-Current Protection circuits looking for bad components or lines but can't find anything. Any ideas where to go next?"

How is <RESISTOR>R5087</RESISTOR> looking? <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> has to be up before we can go through the rest. On rare occasion a sensor transistor or the SMC can pull <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> down but it would still be 0.54v, not 0.09v.
