        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

Everything ok...donor board...solder...et voilà issue resolved..... but unlickly...connect the battery and my screwdriver fall in to the board...damn hell ....so backlight don't work... anyway i have this tensions:\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> before and after the fuse f9700=11.9v\n<SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL>=2.9v\nlvds connetor gnd /21= 19.9v\nwhen the laptop restart after the chime, for a moment the backlight seems to want go on...but blink just a micromoment...\nps.i'm a newbie, don't beat me strong :)"
