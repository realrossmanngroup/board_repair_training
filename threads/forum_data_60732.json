        "820-4929": "What is 820-4929? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD": "What is SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD? SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a pre-requisite for SYS_PWROK_R and PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK..",
        "PM_S0_PGOOD": "What is PM_S0_PGOOD?  PM_S0_PGOOD is created when CPUVR_PGOOD and ALL_SYS_PWRGD are present and branches off to become PM_PCH_PWROK. PM_S0_PGOOD and SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD are necessary to create SYS_PWROK_R and PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK .",
        "SYS_PWROK_R": "What is SYS_PWROK_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "CPUVR_PGOOD_R": "What is CPUVR_PGOOD_R? CPUVR_PGOOD_R is a signal that comes from CPU_VR_EN that is necessary along with ALL_SYS_PWRGD to create PM_S0_PGOOD.",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
