        "message":"Hello there !\n\nI have a board 820-00239 which does not seem to have a liquid damage or knocked off components. So what happens is that machine turns on, trackpad is active, i get the LCD backlight but no picture itself, keyboard is inactive. Tried on external display, still no picture. Any ideas what might be, where i could start troubleshooting?, Bios?, Tried to fit different working LCD. Thank you in advance! :)"
