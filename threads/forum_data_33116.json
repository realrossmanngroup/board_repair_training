After replacing <RESISTOR>R5173</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R5192</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R1802</RESISTOR>/<CAPACITOR>C5013</CAPACITOR>/<CAPACITOR>C5011</CAPACITOR> , power up booting normally. only issue is when u shutdown cant start with the power buttun. Or if you try to power off before booting pressing the power buttun it reboots. <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>  is 3.3v. <RESISTOR>R1802</RESISTOR> both side 3.3v present.\n\nAny idea where to check..?"
