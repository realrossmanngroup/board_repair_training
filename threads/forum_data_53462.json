Came in with the update loop problem after connecting to internet that  \"a critical software update is required for your mac but an error was encountered while installing this update\" and it continuously fails.\n\nI have tried a clean fresh install from Mojave usb drive and fresh internet recovery with the same results.\n\nAlso tried hotspot for internet connection instead of wifi but problem remains.\n\nFound previous post about this issue but cant find anything  that had a solution. Is there anything else to try or check or is this a no fix?"}
