Too much crap on my desk, had to organize. Now, with Real charger the Machine will turn on when plugging in magsafe. But only turns on when plugging in magsafe without battery plugged in. Will not turn on with battery plugged in. It will boot and power button works to cut the power. But will not turn on from power button once shut down. Have to unplug magsafe and plug back in. But this thing was completely dead when I got it. So no idea why its suddenly even turning on."}

I have to disconnect battery, reconnect battery , plug in magsafe and the machine turns back on by itself and boots into OS. Will not start from power button or power pads. Only turn off from power button or pads once it is on. It does see the battery and charges it in MacOS. Battery is genuine and in good working condition. Charger is working and genuine 85W. Thanks.
