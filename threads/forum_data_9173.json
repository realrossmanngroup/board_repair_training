I can tell the board has been worked on by Apple (black sticker, neat work, so I presume it was an Apple refurb) in the VCORE/<CHIP>U7400</CHIP> area. Additionally, probe point 1329 is light-green from previous liquid. Board is clean otherwise. I've never dealt with a shorted VCORE before, but based on information from Louis' videos, it looks like the next step would be to replace <TRANSISTOR>Q7510</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7550</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> all at once. I want to confirm that this is the proper next step before proceeding.\n\nCPU gets warm (as normal--not hot, so I don't think it's getting a straight 12.55v), and PCH gets appropriately warm as well. I have green light and a slight fan twitch, but no vcore voltage (all other S0 rails are present). \n\nClean board, no sign of damage or liquid. Thanks!"
