It would be nice to be able to retain the detail on these pics I'm uploading. They're rendered pretty useless as it is right now. The example pic I uploaded is a 4032 x 3024 pixel image that looks absolutely perfect on my screen, even when zoomed in. After uploading it, it's a 440 x 330 image. Unfortunately, not very useable."}
