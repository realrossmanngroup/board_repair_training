But most parts are untouched or looking almost like new, the only few corroded parts are related to thunderbolt. I even tried to replace some of the really corroded parts but obviously that didn't fix anything.\n\nWhen powering the system on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> drops from 13.3V quickly to ~3.4V and then slowly starts dropping until it hits 1.6-1.9V and goes back to 13.3V. At this moment trying to press the power button (or shorting the <SIGNAL>POWER_ON</SIGNAL> test point) will drop the voltage again to less then 3.4V. This is exactly the same result you'd get by disconnecting the charger.\n\n\nAll the S5 power lines are up, it does not have any S3 power lines and if I remember correctly only 1 of the two S4 power lines.\n\nThe system has no fan spin (and obviously no chime). The charger has a green light, but only when you connected it before <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> started dropping, if this happened you'd need to wait 10-30 seconds before you can connect it with a green light. Connecting the power on a cold start it will always give a green light\n\nMy guess is that the charger's protection circuit is working and disables the power output because something is shorting. I have no idea what though, I've tested some of the major power lines and there is no short to ground.\n\nAny idea where to look?\n\nThese were the power lines by the way in a state where the voltage on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> isn't dropping:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: 13.3v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL>: 13.3v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL>: 13.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>: 3.48v\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.31v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>: 4.97v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_SUS</SIGNAL>: 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>: 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>: 3.31v"
