            "message": "Hi,\n\nI'm a total novice at this stuff so please be patient. I took apart a working non-unibody MacBook Pro 15 inch (probably vintage at this point) to reapply the thermal paste and to blow out the dust. When I tried to turn it back on, I got a green light on the charger and the HD spins up, but no fan spin or display.\n\nAfter investigating, I found that I have all S0 rails except for <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL>. As best I can tell from the schematic, the rail should be generated by <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>. I measured voltages around there, and things definitely look a bit off, but I'm not sure what they should be. (I’m not able to measure directly on the chip—instead I’m measuring at a different component, hopefully nearby, but sometimes on the other side of the board. Should I be trying to measure at the chip itself?)\n\nFor those measurements, I get:\n\n<CHIP>U7600</CHIP> voltages (clockwise)\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]Line Label[/TD]\n\n[TD]Pin Num[/TD]\n\n[TD]Measured On[/TD]\n\n[TD]Voltage[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]10[/TD]\n\n[TD]<CAPACITOR>C7600</CAPACITOR>, pin 1[/TD]\n\n[TD]4.96[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>P1V5S0_TON</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]2[/TD]\n\n[TD]<RESISTOR>R7619</RESISTOR>, pin 1[/TD]\n\n[TD]0.08[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>P1V5S0_VBST</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]14[/TD]\n\n[TD]<RESISTOR>R7615</RESISTOR>, pin 1[/TD]\n\n[TD]4.5[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>P1V5S0_DRVH</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]13[/TD]\n\n[TD]<TRANSISTOR>Q7620</TRANSISTOR>, pin ?[/TD]\n\n[TD]12?[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>P1V5S0_LL</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]12[/TD]\n\n[TD]L7620, pin 1[/TD]\n\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>P1V5S0_DRVL</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]9[/TD]\n\n[TD]Could not measure[/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]GND[/TD]\n\n[TD]7[/TD]\n\n[TD]<RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR>, pin 2[/TD]\n\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]GND[/TD]\n\n[TD]15[/TD]\n\n[TD]<RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR>, pin 2[/TD]\n\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]GND[/TD]\n\n[TD]8[/TD]\n\n[TD]<RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR>, pin 2[/TD]\n\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>P1V5S0_TRIP</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]11[/TD]\n\n[TD]<RESISTOR>R7605</RESISTOR>, pin 1[/TD]\n\n[TD]0.6[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>P1V5S0_VFB</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]5[/TD]\n\n[TD]R76111, pin 1[/TD]\n\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]3[/TD]\n\n[TD]L2700, pin 1[/TD]\n\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P1V5P1V05S0_PGOOD[/TD]\n\n[TD]6[/TD]\n\n[TD]<CHIP>U7880</CHIP>, pin 1[/TD]\n\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_DELAY_L</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]1[/TD]\n\n[TD]<CHIP>U7850</CHIP>, pin 4[/TD]\n\n[TD]3.27[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_P1V5S0_V5FILT</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n\n[TD]4[/TD]\n\n[TD]<RESISTOR>R7601</RESISTOR>, pin 2[/TD]\n\n[TD]4.9[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\nSome of these values look suspicious to me, especially TRIP, TON, and VBST, but I don’t know what they should be.\n\nAlso, the problem seems to be intermittent to a point. After measuring these voltages, I was surprised to find that the laptop screen came on the next time I connected the power cord. However, I wasn’t able to get it to happen twice. I wonder if it has something to do with the heat of having the board on for a while as I was taking measurements.\n\nThanks very much for any guidance at all you can give me!\n\n\n\nGreg"

I think that means it is working ok.  Should I replace it anyway?  The resistors are still in circuit but I think they are measuring ok.  Measuring across <RESISTOR>R7615</RESISTOR> gave me .9 ohms which I think is close enough to 0.  Measuring across <RESISTOR>R7610</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7611</RESISTOR> both read 5.6kohms which I think shows 2 working 10kohm resistors in parallel.  Would appreciate any other ideas. Otherwise I'll start removing resistors (I'm just not very good ad soldering so I'm trying to minimize how much I have to do.)"

            "message": "Thanks very much Piernov. I wish I had known that before I ordered new ones, but live and learn! Regardless, the burned MOSFET doesn't seem to have been essential, as the computer is now working well even without a replacement. The fan problem was caused by my failure to reconnect the GPU temperature sensor.\n\nI'm happy to report that after reconnecting the GPU temperature sensor, the computer is now in good working order. Thank you both for your help and your patience with a beginner!"
