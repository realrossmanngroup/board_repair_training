I took apart a working non-unibody MacBook Pro 15 inch (probably vintage at this point) to reapply the thermal paste and to blow out the dust. When I tried to turn it back on, I got a green light on the charger and the HD spins up, but no fan spin or display.\n\nAfter investigating, I found that I have all S0 rails except for PP1V5_S0. As best I can tell from the schematic, the rail should be generated by U7600. I measured voltages around there, and things definitely look a bit off, but I'm not sure what they should be. (I\u2019m not able to measure directly on the chip\u2014instead I\u2019m measuring at a different component, hopefully nearby, but sometimes on the other side of the board. Should I be trying to measure at the chip itself?)\n\nFor those measurements, I get:\n\nU7600 voltages (clockwise)\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]Line Label[\/TD]\n\n[TD]Pin Num[\/TD]\n\n[TD]Measured On[\/TD]\n\n[TD]Voltage[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S5[\/TD]\n\n[TD]10[\/TD]\n\n[TD]C7600, pin 1[\/TD]\n\n[TD]4.96[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P1V5S0_TON[\/TD]\n\n[TD]2[\/TD]\n\n[TD]R7619, pin 1[\/TD]\n\n[TD]0.08[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P1V5S0_VBST[\/TD]\n\n[TD]14[\/TD]\n\n[TD]R7615, pin 1[\/TD]\n\n[TD]4.5[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P1V5S0_DRVH[\/TD]\n\n[TD]13[\/TD]\n\n[TD]Q7620, pin ?[\/TD]\n\n[TD]12?[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P1V5S0_LL[\/TD]\n\n[TD]12[\/TD]\n\n[TD]L7620, pin 1[\/TD]\n\n[TD]0[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P1V5S0_DRVL[\/TD]\n\n[TD]9[\/TD]\n\n[TD]Could not measure[\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]GND[\/TD]\n\n[TD]7[\/TD]\n\n[TD]R7611, pin 2[\/TD]\n\n[TD]0[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]GND[\/TD]\n\n[TD]15[\/TD]\n\n[TD]R7611, pin 2[\/TD]\n\n[TD]0[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]GND[\/TD]\n\n[TD]8[\/TD]\n\n[TD]R7611, pin 2[\/TD]\n\n[TD]0[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P1V5S0_TRIP[\/TD]\n\n[TD]11[\/TD]\n\n[TD]R7605, pin 1[\/TD]\n\n[TD]0.6[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P1V5S0_VFB[\/TD]\n\n[TD]5[\/TD]\n\n[TD]R76111, pin 1[\/TD]\n\n[TD]0[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP1V5_S0[\/TD]\n\n[TD]3[\/TD]\n\n[TD]L2700, pin 1[\/TD]\n\n[TD]0[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P1V5P1V05S0_PGOOD[\/TD]\n\n[TD]6[\/TD]\n\n[TD]U7880, pin 1[\/TD]\n\n[TD]0[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PM_SLP_S3_DELAY_L[\/TD]\n\n[TD]1[\/TD]\n\n[TD]U7850, pin 4[\/TD]\n\n[TD]3.27[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S5_P1V5S0_V5FILT[\/TD]\n\n[TD]4[\/TD]\n\n[TD]R7601, pin 2[\/TD]\n\n[TD]4.9[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]\nSome of these values look suspicious to me, especially TRIP, TON, and VBST, but I don\u2019t know what they should be.\n\nAlso, the problem seems to be intermittent to a point.

I wonder if it has something to do with the heat of having the board on for a while as I was taking measurements.\n\nThanks very much for any guidance at all you can give me!\n\n\n\nGreg"}

I think that means it is working ok.  Should I replace it anyway?  The resistors are still in circuit but I think they are measuring ok.  Measuring across R7615 gave me .9 ohms which I think is close enough to 0.  Measuring across R7610 and R7611 both read 5.6kohms which I think shows 2 working 10kohm resistors in parallel.  Would appreciate any other ideas. Otherwise I'll start removing resistors (I'm just not very good ad soldering so I'm trying to minimize how much I have to do.)"}

First of all, it now seems that PP1V5_S0 is shorted to ground. I remeasured on either side of L7620 and I get around 0.4 ohms.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Also, I let the \"magic smoke\" out of Q5315 when I was trying to bridge the power pads and my screwdriver slipped.
