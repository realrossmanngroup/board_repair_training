            "message": "hi , thanks for the response , i have just checked the schema , you are absolutely right , there is no ground to it , it is connected to the resisitors and <TRANSISTOR>Q7800</TRANSISTOR> , actually every time it stops working the <CAPACITOR>C7800</CAPACITOR> shows continuity like a fuse as it was a caps so i didn't bother and thought it was getting short to ground and replacing it makes it work for a little while . i did not check the resistor values around it . what do you suggest , is it happening because of faulty <TRANSISTOR>Q7800</TRANSISTOR> ,i will appreciate your advice ,  thanks"
