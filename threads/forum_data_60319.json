It actually ended up booting. I know I had tried to get the board to start with smc bypass but I hadn't triggered the onoff since reflowing the SMC. \n\nDoes this board not start upon connecting to MS1? I don't recall but am thinking that is typical for 2010 and earlier... At this point I believe everything is working except the battery which probably toasted from the spill. I'll run it through testing and report back if further issues. \n\nThanks!"}
