Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

When i replaced the LVDS cable it worked for about 5 seconds. then the backlight came on and off repeatedly as if the macbook was going to sleep and waking up. It was a fade backlight animation and not a straight on/off. then backlight went out completely. \n\nhave tried another LVDS and the backlight is completely off with several LDS cables\n\nboard looks pristine"
