        "message":"Hi there!\n\nHave an 820-2936 here where i thought the LVDS cable was the issue. I thought it had no image. When i replaced the LVDS cable it worked for about 5 seconds. then the backlight came on and off repeatedly as if the macbook was going to sleep and waking up. It was a fade backlight animation and not a straight on\/off. then backlight went out completely. \n\nhave tried another LVDS and the backlight is completely off with several LDS cables\n\nboard looks pristine"
