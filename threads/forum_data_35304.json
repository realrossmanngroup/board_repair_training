        "message":"Hello again,\n\nan 820-3476 that does not charge the battery. There was corrosion on pins 22 23 24 of U7100. Also, a burnt trace from pin 23 to C7125. I removed the ISL, cleaned up the area, put a new ISL in, put a wire from pin 23 to C7125. It still sees but does not charge the battery. Resistance 17\/18 is 4.3Ohm and 27\/28 20.8Ohm.\n\nAny ideas?"
