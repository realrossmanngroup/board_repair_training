The board then started up reliably and worked for several days (notably without any Thunderbolt functionality). Now the board is stuck in S5, with missing PM_SLP signals.\n\nOrdinarily I would suspect a dead PCH\/CPU, but since this board has worked fine until recently, I\u2019m suspicious. Anything I can check before assuming that the PCH just decided to die?\n\nPM_SLP_S5_L: 0V\nSMC_PM_G2_EN: 3.4V\nPPVRTC_G3H: 3.3V\nPP3V3_SUS: 3.3V"}
