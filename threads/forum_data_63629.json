Ive tried creating a bootable USB stick via a ew different utilities off an ISO and it is never seen when I hold ALT. How can a bootable usb be made? Im using an ISO of opensuse.\n\nI dont have a windows distribution but I do have a Microsoft repair usb which holding ALT does see.\nResult is I get a windows logo but then a blue screen reporting mishandled exception and goes back to the macOS logo, rinse, repeat.\n\nFYI Boot holding d I get a report that there may be a problem with the SMC with reference code PPF003 and PPN001 so I decided to try my first SMC removal, reball, replacement with one from a liquid damaged board. Sadly no change [for a lot of time kicking balls into holes - think I will try paste next time]."
