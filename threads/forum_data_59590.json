            "message": "So, I know this is an old machine but this customer has been good to me and I wanna be nice\nWhen plugging in my 85W magsafe I get green light but the board doesn't come on automatically like on other models. However, if I short the pads at <RESISTOR>R5015</RESISTOR>, it will power on, fan spins and the computer attempts to boot.\nAt this point I usually get RAM error beeps, but sometimes it will boot normally, especially if I put pressure on the RAM slots.\nIf it's normal for this model to not power up automatically when attaching magsafe, I will try to resolder RAM slot, but I wanted to check if I have any other issues to worry about first.\nThanks"
