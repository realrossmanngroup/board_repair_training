This will continue cycling.\nChecked the resistors and traces next to U2890 that seem fine.\n\nAny help where to start would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPS. Have played around a little bit with other Macbook boards, but still a total noob and these USB-C boards are totally new and intimidating to me.\n\nThanks!"}

I would guess corrosion elsewhere as well. U2890 for sure can cause this issue if it's bad, so I would replace it from a donor 00875. PP3v3_G3H 3.3 volts? Any signs of corrosion near U31\/200?"}
