This is my first time working with a shop that will hire me if I can prove I can fix boards for them.\n\nI have gotten a macbook air with no power but green and orange light. No power but does charge. The board makes it to S0 state. <SIGNAL>PPV3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is present but <SIGNAL>PPV5V_S0</SIGNAL> is not. I found that the enable signal to <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> was not present. I then found that resistor <RESISTOR>R8187</RESISTOR> which is more a jumper was open. This jumper takes the <SIGNAL>P5VS0_EN</SIGNAL> signal from <CHIP>U8180</CHIP> and sends it over to <CHIP>U8080</CHIP>. <CHIP>U8180</CHIP> does have all the right voltages including the outgoing engage signal for <CHIP>U8080</CHIP>. I jumpered <RESISTOR>R8187</RESISTOR> and found that engage signal still does not make it and it even goes missing at <CHIP>U8180</CHIP> now too. If I measure the incoming voltages to <CHIP>U8180</CHIP>, the VCC voltage is still there but <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> begins to \"blink\" as if is being overwhelmed and protecting itself. <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> does also have it's VDD. It's as if <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> engage pin is shorted to groun and when I reconnect <CHIP>U8180</CHIP> it messes it up too. Also after this test it seemed like <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> was hot. <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> doesn't measure low to ground on output, VDD,  or engage pin. I believe the IC might just be dead. Is my diagnosis correct you think?\n\nI see the IC is for sale from china but would take a long time to get here.\n\nDoes anyone have this IC on hand who can sell it to me? Even if it's from a dead board. SLG5AP1443V is the part number. Cannot find datasheet.\n\nThanks!"

My theory was that if a dependent buck converter was drawing excessive current, or perhaps any other circuit where IT'S output has a short, it would cause <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> to draw excessive current and it be commanded to stay off. If the short was on the output of a dependent circuit this would also mask the short when measuring <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>. Does that sound plausible?\n\nI am not aware as to how to perform SMC bypass. Can you please explain?

            "message": "My updates for today.\n\nI figured out what i think is the SMC bypass routine. Put everything back together and connected the magsafe charger while holding down the power button for a while. Nothing happened.\n\nTried SMC reset too, with and without charger connected. With the charger i can see the amber light go back to green for a moment.\n\nWent around analyzing <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL>. This voltage dips and ticks if <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is around at the same time. It is created by <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> both of which feed from <SIGNAL>PPBUS_GH3</SIGNAL>. This rails flickers a bit when the fault occurs but only goes down by about 0.2 or 0.3 volts. So the fault is definitely on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> or its associated components. This same IC creates <SIGNAL>PP3V_S5</SIGNAL> through <TRANSISTOR>Q7560</TRANSISTOR>, this rail is working fine.\n\nI went looking for things that could cause a new load on our <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> when <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is activated and found:\n\n<CHIP>U7600</CHIP> untested other than for shots.\n<CHIP>U8080</CHIP> which we know works fine as long as <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> isn't on so no short or issue here as far as i can tell. All of <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is clear as it works while <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is not available.\nL4011, not on this board.\n<CHIP>U4600</CHIP> USB port power. I looked for shorts, none and also to make sure there was no pin throwing a fault. This pin is high 3,3V which means its okay as its active low. If im not mistaken.\n<CHIP>U6410</CHIP> speaker IC. Removed a jumper to isolate it, did not help.\n\nThere are some more things but this is what i looked into.\n\nThe only other main place I can see is the DC in/Audio board I actually did find a bit of corrosion here, it's light but there. Hiding under the ribbon cable that connects this board logic to the main. I found that the codec IC has several resistors that read ground on both sides. These resistors were removed and the ground was only on one side. However all these resistors are all only 0 ohm resistors so perhaps this is how they are. Removing them did not fix the issue but perhaps there is a short inside the IC? Why there would be these external connections to ground for the IC?\n\nIf anyone had me that could confirm that would be great, it's my only real clue right now. The board is APN 923-0430 aka <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3453</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A. I see a thread here with some also describing problems with <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL>. Would hate to buy this board only to find it's not the issue.

Found chip info but not much help.\n\nNVM about the Codec, those were inductors to ground.[/URL]"

When I ground the enable pin to <CHIP>U8005</CHIP> 1.05V PCH HSIO Switch all the rails turn on, including some of the ones that didnt turn on before like L7310 and L7320 which are making 1.05V volts.\n\nThe offending line seems to be <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0SW_PCH_HSIO</SIGNAL>. Concerning me is the fact that some of theses connections go to the PCH. Many of them in fact. Any clues? Onward....\n\nThere is no shorts on it's output or input. Need to see if this is enable on high or enable on low.\n\nEDIT: Okay so turning it OFF brings everything else back online."
