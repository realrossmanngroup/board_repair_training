This one doesnt, it needs to trigger the pwr button but this only happen if I unplug and plug (like fast, in the same movement), if I wait a couple seconds unplugged it turns on when plugging the charger again. \n\nIs this behaviour normal? I remember unpluging and pluging and the board would turn on. Same bahaviour with KB disconnected."
