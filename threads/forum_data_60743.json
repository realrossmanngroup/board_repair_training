        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "SSD_RESET_L": "What is SSD_RESET_L? SSD_RESET_L is a signal that puts the SSD in reset mode when it is low. This means the SSD will not be accessible when this signal is asserted.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v..",
        "SSD_PWR_EN": "What is SSD_PWR_EN? SSD_PWR_EN is a signal that tells the chip making the power rail for the SSD to turn on when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

SSD_RESET_CONN_L is a signal that goes to the SSD that will put it in RESET mode which will keep it from working, when SSD_RESET_L is present. _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. .",
