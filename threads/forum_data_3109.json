            "message": "I have a 2015 Retina 13\" board that's working completely fine except it does not recognize the webcam. All ports (USB, SD Card, Thunderbolt, etc. are working.) There was a little bit of corrosion in multiple spots. There was a very small amount near the webcam connector, but the pins look completely unaffected. I've tried multiple webcams with no change. I've tested all voltages and found none only <SIGNAL>PP0V675_CAM_VREF</SIGNAL> missing. Does anyone know how this is created? It seems like it's coming from <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>. Maybe <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> was damaged or I'm missing a signal that triggers <SIGNAL>PP0V675_CAM_VREF</SIGNAL>? On a known good board, <SIGNAL>PP0V675_CAM_VREF</SIGNAL> is on as soon as the board gets power. No webcam needs to be plugged in. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."

It's still producing 1.194 volts though. I put some voltage through it but can't find any obvious shorts or issues."
