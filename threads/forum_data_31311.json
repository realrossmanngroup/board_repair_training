        "820-3436": "What is 820-3436? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "P5VS4RS3_EN": "What is P5VS4RS3_EN? PP5VS4RS3_EN is a signal that enables the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail. When you see _EN in front of a signal name, it means that it is enabling whatever comes before the _EN when the signal is high..",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "CPU_VCCST_PWRGD": "What is CPU_VCCST_PWRGD? a SIGNAL.",
        "SSD_CLKREQ_L": "What is SSD_CLKREQ_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "SSD_PWR_EN": "What is SSD_PWR_EN? SSD_PWR_EN is a signal that tells the chip making the power rail for the SSD to turn on when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "PP3V3_S0SW_SSD": "What is PP3V3_S0SW_SSD? a SIGNAL.",
        "SSD_RESET_CONN_L": "What is SSD_RESET_CONN_L? SSD_RESET_CONN_L is a signal that goes to the SSD that will put it in RESET mode which will keep it from working, when SSD_RESET_L is present. _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. .",

        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "3V_S0": "What is 3V_S0? a SIGNAL."
