        "message":"hi guys,\nIm working on a 820-3662 board, it's experiencing intermittent shut down while the laptop is being used. sometimes the graphics will get pixelated before that.\nI ran the ASD and it says reference code PPM002\"there may be an issue with a memory module. additional reference code:ppm003\n\nnot sure where to start, the GPU, PCH,CPU ,are all integrated into one chipset on board. wouldn't want to touch them\n\nIm doubting on the memory module on the board. thinking to reflow them. just trying to see if any one got similar cases before and have successful repair experience on it.\n\n(I don't want to mess around since there are so many modules on the board)\n\nthanks!\n\n(sorry typo in the title,should be 820-3662)"
