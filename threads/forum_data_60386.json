If it's not present the circuit for USB-PD negotiation in the CD3215 won't work.\nOn A1708, U3200 is the master and U3100 is the slave. There is a chance the issue is with U3200, or there is a communication issue between U3200 and U2890. More info here: [URL]https:\/\/logi.wiki\/index.php\/CD3215_Bootup_Sequence[\/URL] .\n\nMeasure diode mode to ground on the 4 LDOs of both CD3215 to try to see if there's a problem."}
