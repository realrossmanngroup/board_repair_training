I\u2019m getting 3 beeps.  Fan is spinning and I checked u7300 enable signals and output at L7330 on pin 2 I have 1.5v. With no ram present it beeps once every second with ram installed it beeps 3 times. I tried 3 different modules. So I need some help"}

But I\u2019ll go over them again. I also checked each pin individually for connection to ram. May I ask you can a question? I see their are several phases of the cpu is it at all possible that it not passing the data integrity because the cpu isn\u2019t at the proper state for checking data integrity? I\u2019m sorry if this sounds ridiculous. Also is there a reset signal that might be suspending the cpu or like a sleep state ?"}

What I did find was pm_mem_Pwrgd is 1.4v on q3220, r1120 pin2 its also 1.4v I was thinking it was low but being that it\u2019s also going to the u1800 maybe It isn\u2019t. Pm_mem_pwrgd_L is .560mv  So by the voltage divider it should be .800mv. since it\u2019s being pulled low i believe it\u2019s Still working ok and it\u2019s passing pm_mem_pwrgd but is 1.4v The correct voltage for this rail?\nAre these voltages correct?"}
