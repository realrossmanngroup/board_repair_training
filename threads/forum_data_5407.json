        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

        "SMC_LID_R": "What is SMC_LID_R? SMC_LID_R is the signal coming from the hall sensor that detects whether the laptop screen is closed or open. This must be high in order for SMC_LID to be high. SMC_LID has to be high for the machine to not fall asleep and for it to have a backlight..",

The bar goes very slow and stops at around 1/3 the way and the cursor will appear and the spinning wheel then it just shuts off and the fan stops spinning. When I remove the charger the fan will start spinning for like another 5 seconds but no bootup then it will shut off again.\n\nI don't even know what I should check for this issue.

I would remove edge bonding(ALL OF IT, NO EDGE BONDING SHOULD BE UNDER THE SMC BROKEN OFF), and do a light reflow. duke advises against reflow because people who lack experience will fuck the entire board(which is usually the case). i've never had experience with cleaning go well without a full reflow of the SMC but my SMC reflows have never fucked a board so I don't worry about minor cleaning vs. full reflow. so i'd practice reflowing a chip like this and seeing it \"move\" on a board that is totally dead before doing it to this one."
