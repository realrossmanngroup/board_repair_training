The bar goes very slow and stops at around 1\/3 the way and the cursor will appear and the spinning wheel then it just shuts off and the fan stops spinning. When I remove the charger the fan will start spinning for like another 5 seconds but no bootup then it will shut off again.\n\nI don't even know what I should check for this issue. I tried with another HDD and the same thing happened."

If it wasn't turning off at boot I would guess SMC_LID is low, either from corrosion on the board you can't see or a bad battery indicator(which I hope you are unplugging for these tests). If small liquid got by LP8550 it isn't a stretch to imagine it got under the SMC as well which is right next door."

I would remove edge bonding(ALL OF IT, NO EDGE BONDING SHOULD BE UNDER THE SMC BROKEN OFF), and do a light reflow. duke advises against reflow because people who lack experience will fuck the entire board(which is usually the case). i've never had experience with cleaning go well without a full reflow of the SMC but my SMC reflows have never fucked a board so I don't worry about minor cleaning vs. full reflow. so i'd practice reflowing a chip like this and seeing it \"move\" on a board that is totally dead before doing it to this one."

I put some flux and heat to get rid of it then tested the resistance and it was 100k. I plugged the charger in and it was showing around 0.26v - 0.30v on both sides of the resistor."
