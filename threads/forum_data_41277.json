        "message":"Hi guys I have an 820-3462 with some small liquid damage around these components:\n\nNear Q2620\nR2851\nL6754\nU5360\nQ7220\n\nDe mac sometimes turned on but most of the time not. After replacing corroded R and clean up corrosion life was looking great. Ultrasoniced the board to get rid of the flux, and now I dont get a light on the charger, bummer. Area around U7000 and DC IN board all looks super clean. I get a fluctuating 16.2 - 16.76 on F6905 and nothing on DC IN at U7000 (pin 2) 15 - 15.52 on pin 1. Parts in the charge circuit all look pretty neat. No short on F6905. PPBUS, PP3V42 atc obviously all 0 as it seems power isnt making its way to U7000. Where to start? Havent fixed many of these yet."
