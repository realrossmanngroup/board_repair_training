When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",

After replacing corroded R and clean up corrosion life was looking great. Ultrasoniced the board to get rid of the flux, and now I dont get a light on the charger, bummer. Area around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and DC IN board all looks super clean. I get a fluctuating 16.2 - 16.76 on F6905 and nothing on DC IN at <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> (pin 2) 15 - 15.52 on pin 1. Parts in the charge circuit all look pretty neat. No short on F6905. PPBUS, PP3V42 atc obviously all 0 as it seems power isnt making its way to <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Where to start? Havent fixed many of these yet."
