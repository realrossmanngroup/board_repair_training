But if I put 4 GB (or anything more than 2 GB) it is not booting. No beeps or anything just black screen and the DVD-drive \"start-sound\" looping over and over again until I shut it off.\n\nWorking with 2x1 GB in each slot or 1x2 GB in either slot. But if I put 2x2 or 1x2+1x1 or 1x4 or 2x4 GB it won't boot.\n\nI am using PC3-8500 1066 RAM modules - all working in an identical machine\n\nAnyone know whats going on with this ??"}
