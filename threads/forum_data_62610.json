Checked all big coils but none of them have the same resistance to ground. Injected 1v into PPBUS_G3H drawing .900amps but nothing is getting warm.\n\nSince none of the coils have the same resistance to ground, should more voltage be injected next? L9080 and U9080 do not appear to be shorted to ground."
