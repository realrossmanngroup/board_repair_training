I did a visual inspection, no liquid damage but caps <CAPACITOR>C1680</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C1681</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C1682</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C1683</CAPACITOR> did not look right, as if the metal part on each side was detaching from the body. I measured all four in beep mode and they are all short circuited!\n\nShould I replace the capacitors and go from there or is the CPU blown and itâ€™s a waste of time?[/FONT]"
