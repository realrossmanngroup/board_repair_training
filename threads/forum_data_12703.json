I've got green light in the charger, PPBUS_G3H is 12.54V, all main s5 rails are good. I did a visual inspection, no liquid damage but caps C1680, C1681, C1682 and C1683 did not look right, as if the metal part on each side was detaching from the body. I measured all four in beep mode and they are all short circuited!\n\nShould I replace the capacitors and go from there or is the CPU blown and it\u2019s a waste of time?[\/FONT]"
