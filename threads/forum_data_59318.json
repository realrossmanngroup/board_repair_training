        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",

        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",

I guess she is right but absolutely no corrosion on the board whatsoever.\nIt has green/orange light and the pp3v42 is actually 3.32v (bit low?) and the ppbus is 4.2v and the only thing getting a bit warm (not hot) is the cpu.\nThe area around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> looks as the rest of the board like new , unfortunately absolutely no corrosion anywhere .\nThe board is taking 350 mA ....\nAny tips where to turn :)\n\nThank you all for any tips"
