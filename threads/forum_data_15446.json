            "message": "I have a 13\" MacBook pro (Early 2011)\n\nneither USB ports are \"working\".\n\nEach will light up a mouse for a split second and then goes dark.\n\nBoth have the 5V. \n\nJ4600 which also acts like a SMC debug port has SEL 10 HI (3.4v) and of course OE is low since it is GND. This should select USB, instead of SMC...\n\nJ4610 no mux, just straight up USB and it has 5v, but not lighting mouse for more than a split second (or my USB drive that has activity light built in)\n\nNo liquid damage. \n\nMachine boots and runs just like it should, other than USB issue. iSight camera works, and built in keyboard and trackpad work (they're on a \"USB\" hub)\n\nAny ideas? \n\nThanks!"
