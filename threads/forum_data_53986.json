I replaced this and cleaned damage around the area and also replaced <CHIP>U4830</CHIP>.\nThe board still has no trackpad.\n\n5v is present on L4800 and voltages at <CHIP>U4830</CHIP> all appear to be normal.\nThe 5v makes it all the way up to J4801 and I can't find corrosion damage on anything in this area.\nI am a little nervous here because I am thinking the trackpad could of surged the CPU lines. This was a water damaged board.\n\nThoughts?"
