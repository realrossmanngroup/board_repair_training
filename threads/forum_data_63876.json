Got this one from another shop here and it was missing U3100. I placed it again and had to run a little jumper to establish connection between R3109 and PIN 37 of U3100. Board pulls 5V and 0.25A from charger but won't negotiate 20V. I have 12.24V on PPBUS_G3H and T2 gets a little warm. Machine enters DFU, but does not complete restore or revive. Couldn't find any shorts on the board. I inspected the board and couldn't find any other missing components. I get voltage on all coils around U7800. Any ideas?"}
