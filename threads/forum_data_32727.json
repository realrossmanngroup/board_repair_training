            "message": "Hello all. First post here. so bare with me. \n\nSymtoms: No image to internal Display. Works fine on external. \n\nStill trying to understand the Retina eDP Display Circuit. I can't find a BRD file for this Model so I'm a little confused as the <SIGNAL>PP5VR3V3_SW</SIGNAL> LCD line differs to other models. \n\nTested with KG Display - No Change\n\nNo Signs of Liquid Damage.\n\nL3800 has a spike of 5V then goes to 0V. I'm guessing thats normal and is meant to power the display so it can talk over DDC?\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> - 5V\n\nI can not find <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> on the board so i am unsure if i have <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_5V_RC</SIGNAL>. \n\nSeeing as i have no image and no backlight I'm guessing its a DDC issue. What line handles that on the Retina models? <SIGNAL>LCD_HPD</SIGNAL>?\n\nAny help is much appreciated."
