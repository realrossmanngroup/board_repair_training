        "message":"Hello all. First post here. so bare with me. \n\nSymtoms: No image to internal Display. Works fine on external. \n\nStill trying to understand the Retina eDP Display Circuit. I can't find a BRD file for this Model so I'm a little confused as the PP5VR3V3_SW LCD line differs to other models. \n\nTested with KG Display - No Change\n\nNo Signs of Liquid Damage.\n\nL3800 has a spike of 5V then goes to 0V. I'm guessing thats normal and is meant to power the display so it can talk over DDC?\n\nPP5V_S4 - 5V\n\nI can not find U8300 on the board so i am unsure if i have LCD_PWR_5V_RC. \n\nSeeing as i have no image and no backlight I'm guessing its a DDC issue. What line handles that on the Retina models? LCD_HPD?\n\nAny help is much appreciated."
