After disconnect and reconnect battery it will draw 20V and charge the battery around 2.5a as it should  but after unplugging and plugging back in a couple times it will go down to 4.45V and steadily charge the battery only at 1.49a\n\nTried pram reset but no changes. Tried known good battery as well.\n\nWhat should be checked next?"
