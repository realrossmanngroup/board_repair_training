        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging.."

After disconnect and reconnect battery it will draw 20V and charge the battery around 2.5a as it should  but after unplugging and plugging back in a couple times it will go down to 4.45V and steadily charge the battery only at 1.49a\n\nTried pram reset but no changes. Tried known good battery as well.\n\nWhat should be checked next?"
