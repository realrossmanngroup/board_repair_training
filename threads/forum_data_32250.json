ALL_SYS_PWRGD does pulse.\n\nI checked a lot of things. The only things that looked odd were:\n\n1. pp5v_S0 jumping but only to around 0.2v (which sent me on my U7200 journey as it appeared to be the only rail not jumping to the voltage it should be)\n\n2. MEMVTT_EN is missing and not jumping. Although PM_SLP_S3_L is jumping (so for R3210 i get jumping 3.4v at pin 1 but 0v at pin 2).\n\n3. May be related to 2 but PLT__RESET_L is a steady 0v and does not jump. I get a flash of voltage on PP5v_S3 at R3202 (too fast to read only get a lightning bolt on my fluke)\n\nappreciate the help."}
