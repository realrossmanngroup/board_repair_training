Replaced U1900 U8500 and reballed SMC. Board now powers on with fan spin but only draws 0.175-0.230 miliamps for 8-10 seconds...then powers off then stays on continuously drawing a steady 0.235 miliamps. No chime but fan spins. Replaced SMC to rule out but same symptoms. Also swapped bios for testing but same issues.\n\nWhat to check next?"}
