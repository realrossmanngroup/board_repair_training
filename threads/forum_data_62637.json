        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
