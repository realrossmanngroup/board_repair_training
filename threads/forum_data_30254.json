Should be 0, if it detects any kind of resistance more then just touching your probes together it's dead\n\n0.8Ohm to ground on PPBUS is definitely a short by the way. Inject voltage and find the source of the short.\nKeep an eye on the temperature of the CPU because you can't inject more then 1.2V without having a chance of killing it when the CPU high MOSFET is shorting. If the CPU is not getting hot the short is somewhere else and you can increase the voltage further in case you reach the amparage limit"
