        "A1425": "What is A1425? A1425 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Early 2013, Late 2012 with EMC 2672, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3190, 820-3462..",
        "820-3462": "What is 820-3462? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PPVBAT_G3H_CONN": "What is PPVBAT_G3H_CONN? This is the where the batteryâ€™s power rail connects to the motherboard. ."

Please let me know if you have any ideas, I am totally out :(\n\nNot sure if it helps but the fan is also spinning in full (might be because the logic board is outside the case?). I am using a 80W charger that I use for my 15\" larger mac.\n\n* Board turns on and boots okay without the battery connected (someone told me to check that but don't think its relevant)\n* Charger light is orange, not sure if it should be green\n* <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.55V\n* Pin 17/18 of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> = 2.8Ohm\n* Pin 27/28 of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> = 20.3Ohm\n* <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CONN</SIGNAL> without charger = 230mV\n* <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CONN</SIGNAL> with charger = 2.15-2.17V pulsing\n* <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> = 3.392V\n* Resistance of 17,18,27,28 of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> to GND = OL\n\n\nThanks!\nRohit"
