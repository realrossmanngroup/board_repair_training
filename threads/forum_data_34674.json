        "message":"Hi Everyone,\n\nMy retina A1425 is not charging (but recognizes them fine), so I bought 2 new batteries and neither of those are charging either. Please let me know if you have any ideas, I am totally out :(\n\nNot sure if it helps but the fan is also spinning in full (might be because the logic board is outside the case?). I am using a 80W charger that I use for my 15\" larger mac.\n\n* Board turns on and boots okay without the battery connected (someone told me to check that but don't think its relevant)\n* Charger light is orange, not sure if it should be green\n* PPBUS_G3H = 12.55V\n* Pin 17\/18 of U7000 = 2.8Ohm\n* Pin 27\/28 of U7000 = 20.3Ohm\n* PPVBAT_G3H_CONN without charger = 230mV\n* PPVBAT_G3H_CONN with charger = 2.15-2.17V pulsing\n* SMC_BC_ACOK = 3.392V\n* Resistance of 17,18,27,28 of U7000 to GND = OL\n\n\nThanks!\nRohit"
