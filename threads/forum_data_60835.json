No liquid damage, board looks perfectly fine, no corrosion at all and nothing getting hot. I get all voltages from page 84 up to <SIGNAL>PPVTT_S0_DDR</SIGNAL>. From that down the list nothing is present. <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> is reading low. It starts at 0.1V and goes slowly up to around 0.35V, jumps to 1V and goes back to 0.4V where it stabilizes. Looks like something is dragging it down. I'm suspecting bad PCH, but want to be sure before sending this back to costumer as I don't have proper equipment to replace that chip. Any hints?"
