Nothing.\n\nPPVCORE_GPU is 0.85V is that right? I don't have a working board to test"

I assume then a similar problem on the board could do the same.\nI notice that the external drive LED is not flashing as it does on all good machines I have plugged it into.\n\nI have be through a laborious process and tested everything around GFX \/ GPU power and everything reads OK.... Completely at a loss! No fucking idea where to go from here.\n\nAny guidance please?"
