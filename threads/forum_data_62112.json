Replaced U3100 and SMC and got 20V back, but still no power. Compared side by side with another board from same model and cannot find any missing components. It does not pull any current from wall charger. Could not find any shorts to GND. PPBUS_G3H stable 13V, board does not pass S5, stuck in S5."
