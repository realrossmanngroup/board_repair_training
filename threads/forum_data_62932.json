            "message": "Have this board, appears  have gotten slight liquid spill on J4402 and around  the components close to it, as far as <DIODE>D3370</DIODE>. I'm not reading any shorts on any of those components. I do get a short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_PMICLDO</SIGNAL>, about 9ohms. <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> is clearly blown with a hole on the top of the chip. My question is, can i replace this with one i purchase online or do i have to pull it from a donor board due to board specific restriction?"
