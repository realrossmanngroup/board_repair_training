        "message":"Have this board, appears  have gotten slight liquid spill on J4402 and around  the components close to it, as far as D3370. I'm not reading any shorts on any of those components. I do get a short on PP3V3_PMICLDO, about 9ohms. U7800 is clearly blown with a hole on the top of the chip. My question is, can i replace this with one i purchase online or do i have to pull it from a donor board due to board specific restriction?"
