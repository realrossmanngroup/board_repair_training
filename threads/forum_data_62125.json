Is it true that all G84-603-A2 have white underfill?\n\nI have got supposedly new G84-603-A2 with white underfill and those chips are green, I presumably killed them as they turned brown after I put them on the board so I am really puzzled by the temperature. :("

If it is, it indeed may have gotten overheated.\nAs 2informaticos said, profile will vary between rework stations but also between boards, so you have to calibrate it on your own using donor boards.\nThis BGA replacement is an easy one to do with proper equipment, but you can't get it right on the first try, needs some prior experience with BGA rework.\nThat said, temperature at the chip shouldn't go as high as 245Â°C, and even that is a bit too much. And of course it shouldn't stay for several minutes near reflow temperature.\nIf you have a cheap garbage rework station, I'd recommend reballing the chips with leaded solder before soldering."
