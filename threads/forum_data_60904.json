I'm new here :)\n\nThen:\n\niMac 21.5' A1418 (2012) - 820-3302 board\nNo power, no liquid, no corrosion\n1 Led is on (S5 ok i belive)\nI press the power button (also trigger SMC_ONOFF_L in J5020 pads) and nothing happens.\n\nI don't have much experience with iMacs, but following the datasheet, I verified that these lines (all S5) are present and ok:\n\n- PP12V_S5\n- PP5V_S5\n- PP3V3_S5\n- PP3V3_S5_PCH_VCCSUS_USB\n- PP3V3_S5_PCH_VCC_DSW\n- PP3V3_S5_PCH_VCCSUS_HDA\n- PP3V3_S5_PCH_VCC_SPI\n\nWhen trigger SMC_ONOFF_L, the SM_SLP_S5_L react to 0v and returns to 3.3v.\n\nI don't know what else to check now :\/\n\nThanks!"}
