I'm new here :)\n\nThen:\n\niMac 21.5' A1418 (2012) - <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3302</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board\nNo power, no liquid, no corrosion\n1 Led is on (S5 ok i belive)\nI press the power button (also trigger <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> in J5020 pads) and nothing happens.\n\nI don't have much experience with iMacs, but following the datasheet, I verified that these lines (all S5) are present and ok:\n\n- <SIGNAL>PP12V_S5</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_PCH_VCCSUS_USB</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_PCH_VCC_DSW</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_PCH_VCCSUS_HDA</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_PCH_VCC_SPI</SIGNAL>\n\nWhen trigger <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>, the <SIGNAL>SM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> react to 0v and returns to 3.3v.\n\nI don't know what else to check now :/\n\nThanks!"
