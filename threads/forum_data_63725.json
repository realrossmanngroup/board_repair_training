The first LED is stable, the second one turns on for about 10 seconds and goes off. After about 3-4 seconds, the second LED turns on again, but this time it stays on. I honestly don't know if this is the standard switching behavior of this board (maybe?). But the third LED never turns on and things stop there. The board is very clean, with no signs of corrosion. CPU, GPU and PCH get a little warm. I have already tested another CMOS battery and other RAM memories, with no progress. I don't know exactly where to start on this board. Could you give me a hand? Thanks in advance."}

It was a bit tricky to find a working version, I had to transplant the ME region of the client BIOS to a new BIOS version. I will provide the final version below."}
