Im only asking cause it turned on fine after u8900 replacement, i turned it off, and than this just happened i dont know why. \nAlso, when it was working the usb ports did not work, my mouse got light when i connected it, than right away it died... was the PCH dying the whole time?  Is it worth to order one and replace it?"}
