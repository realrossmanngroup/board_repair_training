I have an A2142 (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) board here for data recovery.\nIt's pulling 5V and auto detects in DFU mode.\n\nThe board was previously in at another shop, there was flux around the T2 Chip, <CHIP>ISL9240</CHIP> and PMIC.\nI changed <CHIP>ISL9240</CHIP> - it appears prior shop attempted reflow on these components... not change or reball them. I am worried they damaged T2.\n\nAll <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> appear to measure good and sequence leading to 20V looks good.\nI understand on this model that T2 chip required to get 20V.\n\nAttempting \"Revive\" in Apple Configurator 2 returns error 4014.\n\nI am looking into the possibility of swapping NAND to another board. Someone told me that could work for data recovery, looking for confirmation (Board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>)\n\nOr in terms of repair on this board, if anyone has any advice on what else I can check.\n\nTIA!!"
