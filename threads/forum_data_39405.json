Looks to be in excellent shape and no signs of any prior work. (<CHIP>U6100</CHIP> has a crack on the edge but I don’t think that would cause this issue).\n\nNot getting any power anywhere. Even if <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> was bad wouldn’t I still see something on F3050? J9600 looks fine. F3050 resistance to ground matches good board. \n\nKnown good DCin cables and charger."
