Looks to be in excellent shape and no signs of any prior work. (U6100 has a crack on the edge but I don\u2019t think that would cause this issue).\n\nNot getting any power anywhere. Even if U3100 was bad wouldn\u2019t I still see something on F3050? J9600 looks fine. F3050 resistance to ground matches good board. \n\nKnown good DCin cables and charger."}

There will be no way to get the SSD to work that I currently know off. For now this board is RIP. No use in buying a chip as the SSD won't work anyway, but if you want to try then go ahead.\nBoard will not power on with the cracked chip at least."}
