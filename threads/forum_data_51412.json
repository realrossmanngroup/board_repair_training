Found two caps that were lifted off their pads. This restore power once resoldered. But I?m not getting any image on the display. I do however get video via the usb-c to hdmi to external display  \n\nI?ve got the below measurements:\n\nPPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_R: 12v\nPPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT: 0v\nEDP_BKLT_EN: 0v\n\nI?m waiting on a donor board to arrive and I was going to replace U9800, but wanted to see if you all had any other suggestions. Thanks."}
