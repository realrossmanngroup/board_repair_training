        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",

        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",

        "GPUVCORE_EN": "What is GPUVCORE_EN? GPUVCORE_EN enables GPU VCORE when it is high, a power rail necessary for the GPU to function so you can get an image on the screen. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "PPVCCIO_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCIO_S0_CPU? PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is a power rail responsible for powering the part of the CPU responsible for communicating with other portions of the machine prior to PPVCORE_S0_CPU being present and must be present before vcore, PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is present when the machine is in an on, RUNNING state. .",

First i found previous work done, they had soldered <CAPACITOR>C4109</CAPACITOR> to <RESISTOR>R4457</RESISTOR>(1) and to ground. This is due to it's pads being missing. In anywise, i corrected the cap connection by soldering it to <CAPACITOR>C4110</CAPACITOR> (1) and ground. I do get .6v for <SIGNAL>PP0V6_SLEEP1_BUCK0</SIGNAL>. I currently don't have an identical board, but a 00239 also reads 0.6v too.\n\nThe below reading from <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> \n<SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n\nGranted, it appears <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> does have sign of corrosion clean up."
