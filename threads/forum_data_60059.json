The fan spins and the cpu is warm but no usb activity. First i found previous work done, they had soldered C4109 to R4457(1) and to ground. This is due to it's pads being missing. In anywise, i corrected the cap connection by soldering it to C4110 (1) and ground. I do get .6v for PP0V6_SLEEP1_BUCK0. I currently don't have an identical board, but a 00239 also reads 0.6v too.\n\nThe below reading from U7800 \nPM_PCH_SYS_PWROK - 3.3\nPM_PCH_PWROK - 3.3\nALL_SYS_PWRGD - 3.3\nPM_RSMRST_L - 3.3\n\nGranted, it appears U7800 does have sign of corrosion clean up."}
