        "message":"Hi i have  this board and I replaced a isl6259 which had a low PPBUS now I have 12.56v I found the I was missing PP1v05_S5 so I check u7600 area and all measurements where spot on I replaced u7600 and now the fan spins for 10-15 secs I went over the rails in diode mode and none are shorted :\/ also no cpu activity with mouse And .859v at cpu. I removed heat sink think maybe no thermal paste but it was fine. All rails are fluctuating expect \u201cPPBUS, PP5v_S5, PP3v3_S5\u201d these 3 are stable. A tiny bit of water damage was on the isl6259 but that\u2019s it. Here\u2019s a video it\u2019s weird because sometimes it\u2019s spins longer than others. \n\n[MEDIA=youtube]hfVgjdQI4Ms[\/MEDIA]"

I\u2019ve enclosed a image of the area they didn\u2019t look quite right Cracks and loose.  I plugged it in and fans spin normally\nI powered it down and connect mouse and speaker had both cpu activity, chime. I tried to install in a chassis and now it won\u2019t chime and it started 3 beeps I\u2019ve tried cleaning the slot, ram and even different ram. Sooo im Stuck :\n\nI measures around and vcore is around 1.04v but doesn\u2019t drop down from there and at Pin 1 r5440 the voltage goes up to 500mv then drops to 99mv. Is this line supposed to be 1.5v? there\u2019s no short here .620 diode mode and pp1v5_s3 is 1.5v stable. Fans spin full speed even though both cpu, gpu Thermal sensors are good. Lastly the Mouse no longer flashing quickly it just blinks every few seconds the after a minute the board shuts down. Check cpu\/gpu for thermal paste and it fresh."
