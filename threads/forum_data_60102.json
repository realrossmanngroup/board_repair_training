I removed heat sink think maybe no thermal paste but it was fine. All rails are fluctuating expect “PPBUS, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>” these 3 are stable. A tiny bit of water damage was on the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> but that’s it. Here’s a video it’s weird because sometimes it’s spins longer than others. \n\n[MEDIA=youtube]hfVgjdQI4Ms[/MEDIA]"

I don’t have ultrasonic :( I didn’t heaT anything as of yet. i replaced <CAPACITOR>C8074</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C8080</CAPACITOR> and some other parts. I’ve enclosed a image of the area they didn’t look quite right Cracks and loose.  I plugged it in and fans spin normally\nI powered it down and connect mouse and speaker had both cpu activity, chime. I tried to install in a chassis and now it won’t chime and it started 3 beeps I’ve tried cleaning the slot, ram and even different ram. Sooo im Stuck :\n\nI measures around and vcore is around 1.04v but doesn’t drop down from there and at Pin 1 <RESISTOR>R5440</RESISTOR> the voltage goes up to 500mv then drops to 99mv. Is this line supposed to be 1.5v? there’s no short here .620 diode mode and <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3</SIGNAL> is 1.5v stable. Fans spin full speed even though both cpu, gpu Thermal sensors are good. Lastly the Mouse no longer flashing quickly it just blinks every few seconds the after a minute the board shuts down. Check cpu/gpu for thermal paste and it fresh."
