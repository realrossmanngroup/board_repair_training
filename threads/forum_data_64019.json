ACTIVATION LOCK STATUS COULS NOT BE DETERMINED BECAUSE THR ACTIVATION LOCK SERVER COULD NOT BE REACHED. TRY AGAIN IN FEW MINUTES “\n\nI have done everything that I know on all this machines, which , ask owners to provide proof of purchases, provide me with the Apple ID and password on the device , I then log into to the Apple ID to confirm the device is indeed same with the serial number, and sometimes asking client to sign out of the device , but this still never helps , beyond getting passed this issue , I just want to understand what’s going on, because I have no clue what the issue could be since I can almost day for certain, this isn’t an issue of a failed hardware, please find images attached below, thank you."

You can change the serial number on this chip but when you try to activate it, you get this message because the serial number does not match with what Apple has on their activation servers I believe. Check if <CHIP>U4770</CHIP> shows any signs that someone removed it or tampered with it."
