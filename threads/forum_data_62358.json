        "message":"Board came in dead but I found corrosion over U7100s current sense components C7122, C7120 and C7125.\nReplaced those caps and got fanspin.\nConnected screen but found during boot power would shut off half way as current draw rose and would then start boot again etc.\n\nSuspected C7120 so removed and could now fully boot.\nAll well and good but then things get strange.\n\nThinking I should do the right thing and put a new 47nF cap in place for C7120 and somehow resistance across sense was around 30ohms.\nConnected to charger with no fan spin. Then I discover R7121\/2 measuring 3 kilohms instead of 10ohms. Burned out?\n\nReplaced R7121\/2, resistance across  U7100 pins 27,28 a healthy 21ohms or so.\nNo fan spin and PPBUS_G3H is only 5v\n\nWTF happened? Bamboozled"
