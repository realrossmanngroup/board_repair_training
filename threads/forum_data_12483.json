She said it froze and shut off and wouldnt come back on. Customer brought it to apple, diagnosed as bad battery. They replaced the battery and the problem remains. They sent it to me... No signs of liquid damage, Works fine off the charger... If i plug the battery in <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is at 8.49 v. PPV3.42 is present. There is no fan spin. However, if i Plug the charger in it starts. If i remove the charger, it runs fine as long as you start it  with the charger. \n\nHere is where things get interesting.... I was measuring voltage at the SMC When I accidentally touched the meter lead between <RESISTOR>R5170</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5172</RESISTOR>... The fan started to spin and the board started... So that must mean the SMC is not on when the battery is plugged in. It passes ASD on battery and when plugged in. The customer is really nice and would like to get this board fixed. Thank you to any help you can provide me. I ordered a TPS51980A (<CHIP>U7501</CHIP>) Becuase that is my guess to what the probelm is."
