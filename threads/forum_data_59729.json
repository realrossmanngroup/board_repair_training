Audio circuit is fine. all my voltages are present and have fan spin. But, no mouse activity. The mouse blinks only once in start up. I checked for cpuvcore voltage it\u2019s 12.5 and resistor R7402 is 90.7k I guess my question is that On pin 1 of R7402 what is the correct voltage that I should have? Can this resistor be failing under a load and still giving me a good reading? This has happened to me before :( \n\nOn board 1- I have 12.3v\n                2- I have  .9v\nNeither of these turn on :\/  look in the datasheet I would expect to see somewhere in the 12v range but I preferred to ask a expert. Thank you for your time"}
