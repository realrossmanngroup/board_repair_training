        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

            "message": "Hi I have a board that doesn’t chime. Audio circuit is fine. all my voltages are present and have fan spin. But, no mouse activity. The mouse blinks only once in start up. I checked for cpuvcore voltage it’s 12.5 and resistor <RESISTOR>R7402</RESISTOR> is 90.7k I guess my question is that On pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R7402</RESISTOR> what is the correct voltage that I should have? Can this resistor be failing under a load and still giving me a good reading? This has happened to me before :( \n\nOn board 1- I have 12.3v\n                2- I have  .9v\nNeither of these turn on :/  look in the datasheet I would expect to see somewhere in the 12v range but I preferred to ask a expert. Thank you for your time"
