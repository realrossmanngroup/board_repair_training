            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nI have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A with a 0.5R short to ground on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>.I removed F7000 and F7001, the short is on the pin2 side. I injected voltage into the pad of where pin2 of F7000 goes and wound up the voltage. It was drawing ~4A at 1.8V and the only thing warming up is the CPU. I'm nervous to turn the voltage up higher than that, does anyone have any tips or advice on what to try next?\n\nI was thinking about removing the current sense resistors <RESISTOR>R7210</RESISTOR> and so on to take the CPU out of the equation. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nBTW, I found that the schematic and boardview for <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00281</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> is close enough to use as the schematic and bv aren't available for this model.\n\nCheers,\n\nAlex"
