            "message": "Hello. I got a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00281</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board in that is not liquid damaged and the board is very clean, but I cannot get it to boot to the internal SSD. When I first start the computer, it does give me an apple logo and the progress bar starts and goes maybe about half way before it reboots itself and gives me a kernel panic error. If I hold the option key on boot, I can see the internal SSD come up as an option to boot from. I was able to boot into recovery mode but the internal SSD does not show up in disk utility. I checked the board and found that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SSD_NAND</SIGNAL> is 3.3v for the first couple of seconds after I connect the charger, but then it drops to 0 and does not come back. I checked <CHIP>U9390</CHIP> and <SIGNAL>SSD_PWRCON3</SIGNAL> fluctuates between 1-1.8v in the first few seconds the board is powered, and then that also drops to 0. I see that signal comes from <CHIP>U8605</CHIP> so wondering if that chip is the issue or could there be some other reason for this?"
