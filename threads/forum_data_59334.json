I got a 820-00281 board in that is not liquid damaged and the board is very clean, but I cannot get it to boot to the internal SSD. When I first start the computer, it does give me an apple logo and the progress bar starts and goes maybe about half way before it reboots itself and gives me a kernel panic error. If I hold the option key on boot, I can see the internal SSD come up as an option to boot from. I was able to boot into recovery mode but the internal SSD does not show up in disk utility. I checked the board and found that PP3V3_SSD_NAND is 3.3v for the first couple of seconds after I connect the charger, but then it drops to 0 and does not come back. I checked U9390 and SSD_PWRCON3 fluctuates between 1-1.8v in the first few seconds the board is powered, and then that also drops to 0. I see that signal comes from U8605 so wondering if that chip is the issue or could there be some other reason for this?"}

I followed his instructions and disconnected the touchbar, LCD and touchID button but still cannot boot to USB macOS. It boots to critical software update each time. I tried to install the update using the internal Wifi and also by plugging in my phone and using my LTE connection but it fails both ways. Seems to be because it cannot save the update to the internal drive."}

The drive is probably dead so this is probably a waste of time. Thanks for the help."}
