Found <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground through <CHIP>U7220</CHIP>. Replaced that and the short was gone but still have the same issue with 5v 0.01a. PPBUS is 0v and <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> is also 0v and not shorted to ground. Wondering if I should continue on this or is this a dead CPU due to shorted <CHIP>U7220</CHIP>?"
