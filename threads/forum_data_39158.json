So r1661 pin 1 that runs to the test point was down. I could not solder a jumper back to it because the pad was so corroded l. Also line for r1663 pin 1 line was down to test point, same for r1669 pin 1 to test point.\n\n\tforgive my boorish question, I'm unfamiliar with board view. I normally fix iPhones.\n\n\tis that test point the only means of communication that the resistors have ?\n\n\tcan I use board view to check what is on the test point line for that specific resistor and run a jumper to closest component?\n\n\talso am I wasting time ?\n\twill any of these resistors causeing no power on ?\n[*]\n[*]thanks again. Any advice or help is appreciated\n[\/LIST]"

If you are measuring a resistor you measure across the resistor and on the Ohm scale. \nCaps you can never measure in circuit if you wanted to measure capacity. On diode mode you would never get 80.1u. I really do not understand what you are trying to measure."
