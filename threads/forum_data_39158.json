So <RESISTOR>R1661</RESISTOR> pin 1 that runs to the test point was down. I could not solder a jumper back to it because the pad was so corroded l. Also line for <RESISTOR>R1663</RESISTOR> pin 1 line was down to test point, same for <RESISTOR>R1669</RESISTOR> pin 1 to test point.\n\n\tforgive my boorish question, I'm unfamiliar with board view. I normally fix iPhones.\n\n\tis that test point the only means of communication that the resistors have ?\n\n\tcan I use board view to check what is on the test point line for that specific resistor and run a jumper to closest component?\n\n\talso am I wasting time ?\n\twill any of these resistors causeing no power on ?\n[*]\n[*]thanks again. Any advice or help is appreciated\n[/LIST]"
