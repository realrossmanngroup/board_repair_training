The problem was that it wouldn't turn on. I have taken out the logic board and tried to troubleshoot the problem, but I am struggling as I don't have any guides or references on how to resolve this issue. \n\nI connected the MagSafe lead with the DCPS and given the input from that to logic board, the led is glowing orange, I checked <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> it's ok, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is also ok, from here I don't know where to go. \n\nI would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with a step-by-step instruction on how to fix this issue. Thank you."
