            "message": "Alright, so I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that the automatic fan control is not working properly. \nBoard is spotless, with no liquid damage. \n\nEssentially, the fan stays around 1200RPM no matter what the temps are. \n\nThe computer idles at normal temperature and the fan hangs around 1200 rpm. However, when pressing the CPU and producing some heat, the fan stays at 1200 rpm. \n\nAll of the sensors are showing proper temp readings, so it seems all the sensors are okay.\n\nI unplugged the trackpad, and I do get high fan speed as I would expect. \nI also moved the board into a known good housing (including fan, SSD, and wifi card) to rule out parts and software completely. \n\nI am also able to manually adjust the fan speed on the software side using third-party software. \n\nI personally haven't seen an issue like this, and honestly don't know where to start, as the fan and sensors are working\n\nThanks for the insight"

            "message": "What max temps are showing?\nI clearly stated that sensors are showing normally. However, the temps showing, will vary if it’s idling, putting stress, etc\n\nHonestly, your advice in this form has gone downhill. You used to give solid advice, and unfortunately it has gone drastically downhill. I’m not sure if you get paid per response because recently - you continue to waste time by asking questions that’s already been posted in the thread. Or your advice is way off base.\nExample, I post one time about a 01700 board not booting without battery, and not charging a stone dead battery, and your advice is “will a client ever use the laptop without a battery attached” \nI can’t even believe youd tell a client that if they walked in with an issue of not being able to charge their unit after it completely died. \n-I came back on a paid form to give other people the solution. Which I do for free on my Facebook group. \n\nmy man, if you don’t have a clue, or experience on a certain board -don’t respond\n\nAt this point, I’m paying for this form to support Rossmann and the r2r. not for the advice given here. \nI’ll continue to pay, because I believe in r2r, but it won’t be for the advice.\n#tryharder"
