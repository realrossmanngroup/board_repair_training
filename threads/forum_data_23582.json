New replacement battery from Amazon. Didn't buy the cheapest or most expensive. Good reviews.\n\nI haven't experienced this problem directly yet - Battery (test 6) Sealed Battery Test is Failing. Battery test 1 Error condition test passes.\n\nI assume this is a communication with smc to get this data thing so that only leaves the battery right?\n\nBattery is charging ok. Previouse work history is tea spilled on the KB. No backlight. Solved by an SMC reset with external usb KB. Now the internal KB is working again, but battery had an X. Suprizingly no water damage on Motherboard. All is working well but running a little slow. All hardware sensors are reading within range.\n\nThanks and happy Friday."}
