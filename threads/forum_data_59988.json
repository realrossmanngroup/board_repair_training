            "message": "\"I need both of these signals to get <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWRGD</SIGNAL>.\" \n\nIt turns out you are right. I will explain how I know in a moment. However, please take a look at pg. 3 on the schematic. Step 27. There is an AND gate with <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_PGOOD</SIGNAL> on one side and <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_AXG_PGOOD</SIGNAL> plus some other PGOOD signals on the other. If all those signals are present, <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWRGD</SIGNAL> comes out the other side. Am I reading that correctly? \n\nStrangely, the schematic seems to contradict itself. At the bottom of pg. 24 it looks like you can get <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL> with just <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_PGOOD</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>. Also worth noting:  <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWRGD</SIGNAL> mentioned on pg. 3 step 27 does not appear anywhere else in the schematic. It seems like they changed the name on pg. 24 to <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL>. \n\nOn this board, ISL 6259 was blown. After I replaced this chip, the board powers on most of the time. However, occasionally i do lose fan spin and green light on charger. I replaced SMC to try to fix that but it still sometimes happens. \n\nI was spending my time trying to get <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_AXG_PGOOD</SIGNAL> and didn't even test for boot. It turns out that when the fan does spin, it actually does boot. Any suggestions on why it is unstable and sometimes not power on?"
