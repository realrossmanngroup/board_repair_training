And saw someone suggest U6630 from a Google search. So I guess I was fishing. This is the same board that I just had the BL issue with U9600. Will check your suggestions. Thanks for the help guys."}

All recommended components to check are good. I did have to replace DZ6700 and DZ6704 because the where both cracked but these are for audio jack. Other then that everything looks OK. Thanks."}

After I shut it down and restarted it the audio did not work at all. I'm guessing that t isn't the chip itself but like you said a component around it because it seems like by heating up the area when I replaced the chip is what made it start working. Tantalum capacitors? Thanks man."}

I cannot help you find the damaged cap\/resistor. Only thing I can say is look closely and measure.\n\nYou are sure the complete device is not detected? Also nothing on headphone?"}
