        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",

Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SENSE_OUT": "What is BKLT_SENSE_OUT? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKL_FB": "What is BKL_FB? This is backlight feedback. It goes from the output of the backlight circuit back to the LED driver, so it can see what it is doing. If this line is broken or corroded, the boost circuit will not boost PPBUS_G3H to a higher voltage for backlight, and backlight voltage output will be the same as the PPBUS_G3H input. This trace/via is usually the first to corrode since it is the highest voltage in the system..",

            "message": "Got a Mid-2015 15\" retina board here, everything works fine except for the backlight on the screen. LVDS connector had corrosion on pins 2/3/4, LVDS cable had corrosion similarly on both LB and screen side in the same areas. Connector cleaned nicely, but the LVDS cable had pin 1 basically broken off of the plastic that holds it, along with the plastic itself. Decided to swap the cable with a known good one, but after inserting and seeing the same issue, I removed it and found it also now had it's LVDS cable's pin 1 broken off with the plastic.\n\nSpitballing, but seems like this connector needs replacing, yes? Every cable I put in has it's end chewed off by something inside--can't get a good enough look with my microscope lenses. The connector itself looks fine on it's pins connected to the LB after cleaning, but it'd be good to replace it anyway.\nI'm not sure what I'm supposed to be reading on the capacitors connected to pins 3/4, I don't have the boardview or schematic right now, but they look off--both diode mode and resistance mode show endlessly climbing values."
