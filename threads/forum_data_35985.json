Traced this back to starting point at <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR>. Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> and the fluctuation was gone.\nNow PPBUS was low at 4volts. Replaced F7020.\nNow <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> fluctuates between 6 and 8 volts on F7020.\nAlso replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> because why not, this did not change anything.\n<RESISTOR>R7080</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7081</RESISTOR> checked out as having the right values.\n\nChecked for short on PPBUS and most of the times I get 25 kilo-ohm but other times it fluctuates a lot.\n1.4 ohm between pins 23/24 on <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, 21.8Kilo-ohm between pins 16/17.\nGreen light on the charger was intermittent but now stays on solid green. Power draw on PSU is 0.014 - 0.020 amps with occasional high spikes to 0.096 or somewhere in that area (it happens really fast).\n\nCould use a few pointers to get me in the right direction. <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> are my mortal enemies and except for RAM pin issues, these make me pull my hair out (what little is left) constantly.\n\nAny help appreciated :)"

Look at diagram and tell me which pins you should be checking between and what the values should be. <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> is also suspect."
