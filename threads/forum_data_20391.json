            "message": "This is a rush job, I have no time to investigate properly, and hoping for clues.\nWe always have display on external monitor, sometimes we have on the internal display, sometimes not. We booted three times, only last time did we get display from internal monitor.\nCustomer said most times pulling the external monitor leads to having display on the internal monitor.\nInternal screen tested with another board, worked every time. Could be a coincidence?\nBoard does not show any trace of previous repair and no corrosion anywhere.\nScreen connector looks good, board connector looks good. Poking at the screen cable does not cause display to come and go.\nHall effect resistor (0 Ohm) is ok. Hall effect component is present and measuring across same as a donor board.\nI have continuity from resistor to SMC 100K resistor.\nAny clues on where to start are highly appreciated. TIA."

Got 12.6V that turn to 39V whenever the display decides to light up. \nIt did it once when I was testing the voltages, and the LCD cable partially slipped out. I pushed it back in and got backlight.\nI will give it back and wait to receive the new screen :-/\nP.S.: using new LCD cables. Both give the same result. The original cable is bad, show no display nor backlight."
