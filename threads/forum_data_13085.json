        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "U7941": "What is U7941? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",

            "message": "Repairing this board for a friend, but looking more and more like a bad PCH. I want to make absolutely sure before giving him the bad news.\n\nBoard had liquid all over, 7+ areas. Replaced obviously bad components. <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> was shorted; found <CHIP>U7941</CHIP> was shorted, replaced, and short on 3v42 was gone. Got green light. Fixed some burned traces in a few areas, and ppbus was very low. Replaced ISL, got solid 12.58v on ppbus. Now all S5 rails present (including <SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL>), but <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> is not present. VRTC is present everywhere it should be, and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> is also present. Resistance to ground on L7630 is 7.6ohm.\n\nIs there anything else I can check before declaring this board irreparable (I can't replace PCHs)? Thanks for any help."
