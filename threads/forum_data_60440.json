        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

Anyway, <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> had a couple of LDO caps shorted to nearly 0V. I pulled them to check if it was the caps but it was <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>. Changed it and went well and shorts were gone but I was drawing 0 amps. I swapped the chip again... same thing? I'm not understanding what's happened. The chip swap went very smoothly. Chips I have already had balls so all i had to do was clean pads and flux and solder on. I've rechecked the area to see if anything moved or chips gone or anything (even though I have zero reason to think anything happened) and not seeing or understanding a reason why I'm not drawing anything. Checked fuses near the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s and they're all good."
