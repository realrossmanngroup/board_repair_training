            "message": "Hey guys,\n\nI've got an iMac A1418 over here with boardnumber <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3588</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A\nNo liquid damage but doesnt turn on. The fan spins for about 5 seconds and then turns off, No chime or backlight to see.\nIf i do a SMC reset it keeps spinning till i pull the powerplug.\nThe diagnostic leds are telling me that the GPU is faulty. Only the first 2 are lit.\nI've tried an known working LCD screen, and connected it to an external monitor. No luck so far.\n\nSince i'm not that experienced in troubleshooting GPU issues, I'm hoping someone can give me a good point to start with.\n\nThanks in advantage!"
