        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "SMC_LID_RIGHT": "What is SMC_LID_RIGHT? SMC_LID_RIGHT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the right LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed â€“ if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_RIGHT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
        "HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT": "What is HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT? HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT is a signal from the hall sensor on the RIGHT side of the machine that indicates that the lid has been closed. This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen."
