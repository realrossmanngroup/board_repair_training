        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. ."

            "message": "hey folks,\n\nGot a 820 3437 that came in for no backlight. Replaced the backlight driver and now the backlight works for a second after the chime, then turns off. Any ideas on where I should start looking for the issue here? The driver works, backlight works but something is turning it off. This issue is not making sense to me so don't know where to start :)\n\nAny help appreciated"
