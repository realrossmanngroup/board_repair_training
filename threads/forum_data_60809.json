I then changed CPU to new CPU and [B]all 3 of the boards turned on.[\/B] The problem is that [B]all 3 of the boards now boot to file with ? (No SSD detected).[\/B]\n\nIs there something I am missing here? I have done many CPU swaps on 820-00045 and I never have issue with file with ? afterwards.\n\nIs there anything anyone can think of as to why I keep getting missing SSD on 820-00244 after successful CPU swap?\n\n[B]It feels like I must be doing something wrong[\/B], but I can't figure it out based on schematic or board view.\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!!"}
