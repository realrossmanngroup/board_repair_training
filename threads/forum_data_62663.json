Just the desired backlight voltage of the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> seems to be a little amount higher. I think I can't destroy anything?\nSomeone already tried this?\n\nthanks!"

Although it's not happened already, this is still a \"flexgate\" screen.\nI will search for a good, or repairable board for the Macbook\nBut is there a known good workaround to prevent flexgate with this screen?"
