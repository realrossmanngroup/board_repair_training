Sometimes goes a bit up.\n\nI moved the board to a working case and it powers on loads accounts etc but doesnt charge battery. So the logic board itself seems fine, however there is a problem with USB \/ Charging.\n\nso summarized: Board works in a different case with a charged battery. Battery in the original case is flat (wont power on in there, because probably didnt charge anymore) Powered on in the other case i got 20V 0,1A draw but no charging.\n\nhow can i further troubleshoot ? I ordered the cd3217b12 chips, but as i get 20V shouldnt that mean they are probably fine ? What should i measure and continue to troubleshoot.  Boardview and shematics i have.\n\nThank you!"}

Soldering is no problem.\n\n2) DFU I tried, I have another working m1 I repaired and I put the broken one in dfu mode, in Apple Configurator I chose \u201erepair\u201c , but at some point on installing system it always reboots and doesn\u2019t finish dfu restore\u2026 not sure if I chose the right option.\n\nThank you very much!"}
