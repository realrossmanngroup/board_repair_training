Coffee.\n\nThe machine has 20V and consumption of 500ma.\n\nI have ALL_SYS_PWRGD\nI have CPU voltages\n\nI am missing PPVCCEDRAM_S0_CPU.\n\nThis voltage comes out of U7710, the activation PVCCEDRAMS0_EN_FILT_BUF\nI'm missing, it comes from U7712.\n\nU7712 would like to know how this circuit works?\n\nI understand through the PDF that it is activated by PVCCEDRAMS0_EN_R, it comes from R7758 and it comes out of U7711.\n\nU7711 has PP3v3_S5, has ALL_SYS_PWRGD_R, but does not have PM_OPC_ZVM_L.\n\nHow should I interpret this problem?\n\nI already restored the system, it gave me error 9.\n\nError 9, disconnect coils from the CPU and restore without problem. I understand that I have the problem in DDR or CPU."}
