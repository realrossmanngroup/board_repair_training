            "message": "Hi everyone, I am trying to troubleshoot a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board from my dad's macbook. He told me that during Big Sur update (from 10.10), the macbook turned off and then never switched on again. \n\nThe symptoms:\n[LIST]\n[*]When powered on, fan spins, trackpad clicks.\n[*]No image (checked with light on screen), no caps lock light.  \n[*]The same happens with or without battery. \n[/LIST]\nWhat I have tried:\n[LIST]\n[*] Reset SMC\n[*] Start in SMC bypass mode\n[/LIST]\n\nWhat I have measured: \n[LIST]\n[*]No USB activity can be detected\n[*]Charger takes 0.5 A at 20 V (goes up from 5 V). \n[*]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> =3.4 V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PPSV3_S4</SIGNAL>=3.32V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PPSV3_S5</SIGNAL>=3.32V\n[*]pp5v = 5.1 V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PPVCCCPU_S0G</SIGNAL> stays at 0.94 V\n[/LIST]\n\nIt seems that all power lines are there but the board does not boot (<SIGNAL>PPVCCCPU_S0G</SIGNAL> remains high). I would like to try clean BIOS however I don't have a programmer and so I guess I will have to find someone that can do it for me (BTW: is there a way to clean the BIOS using e.g. a Raspberry PI?)\n\nProbably I have forgot to measure something useful, could you please help me? Thank you in advance!"

            "message": "First of all, welcome to the forum!\n\nYou are not the first who reported BIOS corruption after failed Big Sur update.\nIn fact, it can happen with previous versions too.\nSo you need new FULL BIOS now; the problem is somewhere else than ME region.\nHowever new BIOS MUST have clean ME region.\n\nNo matters which BIOS programmer will use, you can clean ME region by software.\nYou also need to change serial number and fix Fsys checksum after all.\n\nMedusa programmer has a big advantage: can do all the job onboard, no need to desolder SPI chip.\nBut is not economically viable for a single repair.\n\nTry this file, as is.\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1roFjzlTYrB0oRB5opnRaapdj7Rx2Zg7g/view?usp=sharing[/URL]\nMaybe more available on the forum, if doesn't work.\n\nSome videos about how to clean ME region and change (correctly) serial number can be found on the forum."
