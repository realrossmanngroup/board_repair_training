L6900 and L6901.\nBoth inductors are 1.0UH-20%-3.9A-0.035OHM\n\nI've tried searching the web by the part number (PILE32251E-SM) and by the description with no luck.\n\nWill a 2.2UH-20%-3A-0.052OHM work? I have 2 of these that i can put in.\n\n\nAvailable on hand and with similar package dimensions:\n2.2UH-20%-4.5A-0.043OHM\n2.2UH-20%-3A-0.052OHM\n0.68UH-20%-6.7A-0.0194OHM"}

They are using a different style glue around them that aren?t coming off so easily like previous models. I?ve tried just heating up the chip like normal but it?s not coming off."}
