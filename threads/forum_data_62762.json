I tested several other drives to make sure it wasn't the USB drive that was unresponsive.\n\nI have replaced PI3USB32224BXEAE twice from two donor boards, but still have the same effect of no response from the computer when a USB is plugged in.\n\nAre there other chips that manage USB connectivity other than PI3USB32224BXEAE and <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>?"
