        "message":"It is an old post, but I'd like to add my experience.\nI've noticed that once the SATA-HDD cable goes bad, the HDD itself is soon to follow. I always advise the customer to replace them bother together or keep his stuff backed-up. Since doing this approach had much less issues.\nAlso the SATA-HDD cable replacement program is not *public* and Apple will not always replace them for free like I had posted above.\nFinally it seems that the HDD cable model 821-1480-A it is the faulty model and if the replacement carries the same number, it will keep failing => should be replaced by a cable having a different model number -> this is still to be confirmed. Gathering data about it now."
