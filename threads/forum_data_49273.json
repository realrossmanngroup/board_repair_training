Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. ALL_SYS_PWRGD, PM_RSMRST_L, PM_SLP_SUS_L, and PM_SLP_S3_L are necessary prerequisites for CPU_VR_EN to be present. .",

All voltages are there, also <SIGNAL>5V_S0</SIGNAL>. The CPU has 1.05v, but what is missing is 1.8v <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU_REG</SIGNAL>. I checked <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, it has on pin 18 0.73v, and on pin 20 and 22 1.96v not sure if that is what it should be? VIN and Enable (0.8v) are there. <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0_CPUVR</SIGNAL> is present on <TRANSISTOR>Q7310</TRANSISTOR> and so is the 5V line on pin 6 of <CHIP>U7310</CHIP> and 7320. I?m not sure how to go about testing what comes out of <CHIP>U7310</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> but it looks like something is wrong here. All looks prestine though. Thoughts?"
