        "message":"Hi Folks, have a 820-4924 that came in today. The board is superclean no liquid. All voltages are there, also 5V_S0. The CPU has 1.05v, but what is missing is 1.8v PPVCC_S0_CPU_REG. I checked U7200, it has on pin 18 0.73v, and on pin 20 and 22 1.96v not sure if that is what it should be? VIN and Enable (0.8v) are there. PPVIN_S0_CPUVR is present on Q7310 and so is the 5V line on pin 6 of U7310 and 7320. I?m not sure how to go about testing what comes out of U7310 and U7320 but it looks like something is wrong here. All looks prestine though. Thoughts?"
