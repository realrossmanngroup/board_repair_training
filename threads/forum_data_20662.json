        "message":"I have this machine that doesn't appear to have liquid damage but one indicator stick next to the lcd connector was slightly red and peeled off. Besides that I don't see any liquid damage or corrosion anywhere. All the probe points are gold and look normal.\nI am able to power the machine on and shut it down with the keyboard but I am not able to type anything with the keyboard. I plugged in another new keyboard I have and still the same issue. The caps lock button doesn't work nor does holding the option key on startup.\n\nI checked for continuity on the keyboard connector pins to the probe points above it and they all had continuity.\nThe other side of the keyboard connector is spotless and I checked continuity from the probe points(Pins 1-3) on that side to the ones on the kbd connector side and they had continuity.\nHere are some voltages of the connector with just my new keyboard plugged in.\n1\/2\/3-0v\n4\/5 - 3.4v\npin 6 around 1v\nPin 13 - 0.77\nPin 14 - 2.3v\nPin 30 - 3.33v"
