    "definitions": {
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8000": "What is U8000? a CHIP.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",
        "CPU_VCORE": "What is CPU_VCORE? Power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. .",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",
        "PP3V_S4": "What is PP3V_S4? This is a typo of PP3V3_S4 When you see PP3V_S4, assume they meant to type PP3V3_S4.",
        "PMSYSRST_L": "What is PMSYSRST_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
