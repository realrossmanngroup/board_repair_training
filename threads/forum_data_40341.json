I know the usual 830-3437 with 3 fan rtc cycles before it boot but not aware for these newer model...\n\nAll rails were present except PP3V_S4 witch is low (2,5V) but no short (4kohms to gnd, 0.355 in diode mode). I am not sur if this rail can prevent the board from booting, if I recall it used forr some peripheral wifi, bluetooth, Tbolt, trackpad...\nReplaced U8000, but pp3v_s4 still low.\n\nHere are some measures:\npp3v3_S4: 2,5V\ncpu_VCORE 1,8V\n\nPM_sysrst_L: 3.3V\nPM_PCH_SYS_PWROK: 3.4V\nPM_PCH_PWROK: 3.3V\nPM_RSMRST_L: 3.3V\nPM_BATLOW_L: present 3.3v\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN: present 3.3V\nPM_PWRBTN_L: present 3.3V\nPLT_RESET_L: 3.3V\nPPVRTC_G3H : 3,4v present at all places\nRTC ic clock 32kHz yes\n\nI have no red light on USB.\nI replaced just in case the bios but nothing changed.\n\nI am lost at this point about witch issue I should focus.\nThanks for any suggestion."}

The only tricky one was the PP3V3_S4 being 2,5V instead of 3,3v..\nVcore is present at flat 1.8V no adaptation no red light on the mouse.\n\n\n[USER=\"1153\"]JohnB8812[\/USER]\n\nThanks for the suggestion I've already tried another 820-00165 bios to discard any bios issue. But no change so I put back original Bios. At this desperate point I will try maybe to replace U6101 just to be 100% sure no bios issue.\n\nNext thing I will try to reflow replace again SMC, I've already had a similar issue with 820-3437 macbook air was'nt cycling 3 times, instead it was doing the same: one cycle then stay on, reflowed smc corrected it.\n\nYep it's a shitty one...came back from far but probably not fixable, I will let you know thanks!"}
