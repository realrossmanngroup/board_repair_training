No shorts. Any idea why this happens so much with these boards? Should I be looking for an overcurrent situation with U6990? Not sure how to solve this one."}

And then it burned up again. The other ones I have just burn it up right away, which makes life easier if you know why, but I didn't realize the capacitors might be the issue. Thanks for that piece of info. It looks like the board is working fine again now. No fires."}
