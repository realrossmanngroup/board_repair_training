        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "P3V3SUS_EN": "What is P3V3SUS_EN? P3V3SUS_EN is a signal that turns on the PP3V3_SUS power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high..",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

        "D7005": "What is D7005? a DIODE.",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. ."
