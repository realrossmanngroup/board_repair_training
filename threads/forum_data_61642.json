I get 12V from 4 pins on power supply to board. Is center pin of the powersupply connector supposed to have any power? No fan spin or chime. I have 3v3_s5 and nothing at what I believe is the PP5V_S4 coil. Diode on that coil is .402 and diode check around U7501 seem to be comparable to 820-3662 board. No signs of liquid and nothing noticeably bad on board. CHecked to see if maybe any caps loose (if it were dropped or something) but best guess is maybe supposed to be voltage from center pin on the power supply and that is issue...."}

So I take it no voltage at middle pin of power supply connector is normal? I did verify that the power button closes the circuit correctly so it works at least. I tried SMC bypass just to see but guessing wont work on a mini..."}

Not seeing familiar PP3V42 components but I do have dropping values around the SMC. Any idea if this board should have PP3V42_G3H? Some spots I'm getting 3.38V but I think that is actually PP3V3_S5... If the dropping voltage measurements are supposed to be PP3V42, that would be my issue. Not seeing the familiar coil like whats on A1398 board or 00165. Most of the test points though around the SMC checking with diode are around .712 range... not sure if that could be a tell of any sort. Not shorts though anyway"}
