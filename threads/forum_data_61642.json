If the dropping voltage measurements are supposed to be PP3V42, that would be my issue. Not seeing the familiar coil like whats on <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> board or 00165. Most of the test points though around the SMC checking with diode are around .712 range... not sure if that could be a tell of any sort. Not shorts though anyway"
