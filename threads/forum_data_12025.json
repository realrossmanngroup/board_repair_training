Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

Welcome to our show!\n\n\nThis one turns on but no image (thus no backlight) - it powers on, green/orange light ok, CPU gets hot.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> is 0V (no shorts to ground in the vicinity) and so is signal <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> to <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> (this comes from CPU). I measure L8550 VLDO and VDDIO to be ok at 5V and 3.3V respectively.\n\nHave no spare LCD to try - I do but it belongs to another customer and I dare not damage it.\n\n\nSo since there is no image and I have no other LCD what could I do to go further? (Unless testing another LCD is generally risk-free).\n\nAny way to test if LCD is detected to rule that out?\n\n\nduke, I will waste some of your time after all :D \n\n\ngeorge"
