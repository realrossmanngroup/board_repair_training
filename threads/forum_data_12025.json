        "message":"Hi ladies and gentlemen - its the macbook air week! Welcome to our show!\n\n\nThis one turns on but no image (thus no backlight) - it powers on, green\/orange light ok, CPU gets hot.\n\nPPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is 0V (no shorts to ground in the vicinity) and so is signal EDP_BKLT_EN to Q7707 (this comes from CPU). I measure L8550 VLDO and VDDIO to be ok at 5V and 3.3V respectively.\n\nHave no spare LCD to try - I do but it belongs to another customer and I dare not damage it.\n\n\nSo since there is no image and I have no other LCD what could I do to go further? (Unless testing another LCD is generally risk-free).\n\nAny way to test if LCD is detected to rule that out?\n\n\nduke, I will waste some of your time after all :D \n\n\ngeorge"
