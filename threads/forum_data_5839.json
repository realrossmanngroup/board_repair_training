Has anyone seen this type of thing before? The only diode measurement that's off is on pin 25 <SIGNAL>CHGR_BOOT</SIGNAL>. It's at .454. I usually see something in the range of .585 on that pin. That's with the blown chip still installed."

I replaced the ISL, installed a different battery, swapped the charger and returned it to the customer. It blew again. I pulled the board, repaired it and put it in an entirely different computer and it still blew it in the same way. Not sure what to think. I just replaced the ISL and it starts right up again."
