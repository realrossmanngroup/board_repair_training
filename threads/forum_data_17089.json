I was rather excited by the prospect of a little solder touch-up but touching up <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> made no improvement in this case.\nI heated the GPU and it booted 20 times in a row 2 days apart with no hang. On this occasion I'll just replace the GPU for a new one.\nGreat bit of sharing on the sticky but it did not work this time."
