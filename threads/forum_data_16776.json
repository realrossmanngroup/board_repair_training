F9700 measured OL, replaced and still no backlight. Measured F9700 again, and it was OL again, and blown. This is with known-good test assembly and good LCD assembly. Removed F9700 and checked pin 1 with LCD plugged in, and it measures 12.54v. Not really sure what could be pulling voltage through F9700 to blow it?\n\nHaven't encountered this before, so I replaced <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> to be safe, and no luck, F9700 still blows. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> measures normally with no shorts.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed is appreciated, thanks!"

I didn't even check at the LCD connector initially, definitely an oversight on my part--thanks! Certainly something's up there; went to pull <CAPACITOR>C9797</CAPACITOR> and it cracked away from the solder--clearly defective. Replaced and all is well. Backlight restored.\n\nThanks, Louis!"
