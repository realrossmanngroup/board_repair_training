            "message": "Trying to diagnose a rush repair <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that was liquid damaged near the top edges of the board. After UC I do have a green light on the charger but no fan spin (SMC Reset is recognized). I have many missing power rails but I do have <SIGNAL>PP3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> on <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> with a full 3.3v. On other areas of the board, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> has less than 3.3v (1.7 to be exact) and the board heats up under right under <CHIP>U1000</CHIP> with the charger plugged in. This leads me to believe there is a short or partial short on this power line but because of how large it is, im having a hard time narrowing down where to look. Suggestions? or am I completely wrong in my diagnosis of <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> being the problem."
