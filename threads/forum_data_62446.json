Don't have the voltage on PPBUS_G3H. when I chased the PPDCIN_G3H. I have 15.6V going through up to pin 5 of Q7130. it stops on L7130\n\npin 1 L7130 = 0.663v  \npin 2 L7130 = 0.663v \n\nand then on F7140 & F7141 = 0.558v\n\nC7145 = 0.614v\nC7140 = 0.613v\n\nis that mean the big boy L7130 is gone? :)"}
