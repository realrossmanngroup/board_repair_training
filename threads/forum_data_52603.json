        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "R5115": "What is R5115? a RESISTOR.",
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PCH_INTRUDER_L": "What is PCH_INTRUDER_L? PCH_INTRUDER_L is a signal that tells the machine the case has been opened by an intruder when it is low, the _L means it is present when it is low. This signal should always be high in a Macbook since it doesnâ€™t use intrusion detection. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PCH_INTVRMEN": "What is PCH_INTVRMEN? PCH_INTVRMEN is an Internal Voltage Regulator Enable: When pulled high, this signal enables\nthe internal 1.05 V regulators for the Suspend well in the PCH. This signal must\nremain asserted for the VRMs to behave properly (no glitches allowed).\nThis signal must be pulled-up to VCCRTC on desktop platforms and may\noptionally be pulled low on mobile platforms if using an external VR for the\nVCCSUS rail.",

I replaced a keyboard and track pad on a MacBook Air due to liquid damage and the machine starts up fine, the fan does not run at high RPM, when I run the Apple diagnostic test it doesn't report any sensor issues however the only way I can shut the computer down is by holding the power button with either the battery connected or the charger, but not both. when i attempt to shut it off with both it will simply \"restart\". If I shut down using OS it is the same deal, will only restart. has anyone ever experienced this before? I tried to use a different keyboard and same deal. Will only stay shutdown with power button held. I'm hoping we can solve this so others may learn."

If I have the charger plugged in while shutting down the current will dip from .7 amps to .2 before starting up again with or without the battery plugged in.
