Have charger green, orange light, fan spin, and chime.[\/PLAIN]\n\nI have an 820-3476 with an unusually high PPBUS_G3H at 14 volts. I've checked R7121 and R7122, both are fine. Before I started having trouble with PPBUS_G3H I had a blown U7700 that I replaced. Upon turning on the system and checking PPBUS_G3H, I found it was only outputting 2v, shortly after the new U7700 melted, destroying the traces connecting U7700 pins 9, 10, and 11. I rebuilt those traces, replaced U7700, and replaced the ISL--had to repair damaged pads on pins 5 and 10. I'm not sure what could be causing the high PPBUS_G3H as everything along those paths seems to be right."}

Replaced those resisters as well, they were only slightly out of spec. but at this point it's more worth while to be sure."}
