Have charger green, orange light, fan spin, and chime.[/PLAIN]\n\nI have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3476</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with an unusually high <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> at 14 volts. I've checked <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR>, both are fine. Before I started having trouble with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> I had a blown <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> that I replaced. Upon turning on the system and checking <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, I found it was only outputting 2v, shortly after the new <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> melted, destroying the traces connecting <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> pins 9, 10, and 11. I rebuilt those traces, replaced <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>, and replaced the ISL--had to repair damaged pads on pins 5 and 10. I'm not sure what could be causing the high <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> as everything along those paths seems to be right."
