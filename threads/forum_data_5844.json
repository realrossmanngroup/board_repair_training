I think it might be a dead SMC but not positive? Board has no liquid damage. Any help with thisi board would be great.

I did some more digging and removed L7510 and found that the CPU side has a .001 voltage drop to ground and that seams way to low. :( Im thinking its a bad CPU now. Is it fine to inject 1V on the CPU line to see if its something else that may be shorted?"}
