Ran it through USC, now everything it does is start up - get (assuming) all rails, then turns off after about 10-20 seconds.The only signs of turning on are - spinning up fans and measuring voltages with my multimeter. No sound, no picture - nothing. So I think it fails to \"post\"? PPBUS__G3H always present, PPDCIN always present. It's going into an S0 state for this period of time, then just drops and loses S5, so seems to fully shut down.. CPU VCORE seems to come up at 0.63V (don't know if that's usual, but seems okay). \n\nAny help appreciated!"}

Vcore being present and dropping off and then staying off is not something to diagnose easily. Do disconnect everything to rule out anything attached to the board is causing this."}
