            "message": "<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00239</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> which had extensive liquid damage.\nLocated and removed the short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. Now turns on, charging and works fine. Passes Apple Diagnostic. The only issue seems to be not USB and HDMI output via either of USBCs. No light on a USB drive.\n\nTried SMC reset. Another strange thing is when I do a PRAM reset, I can see the screen flashing for it, but no chime sound. Can't remember if this one had a chime sound or not.\n\nHaven't worked on USB/Video via USBC's before. Where do I look first?"
