Now turns on, charging and works fine. Passes Apple Diagnostic. The only issue seems to be not USB and HDMI output via either of USBCs. No light on a USB drive.\n\nTried SMC reset. Another strange thing is when I do a PRAM reset, I can see the screen flashing for it, but no chime sound. Can't remember if this one had a chime sound or not.\n\nHaven't worked on USB\/Video via USBC's before. Where do I look first?"}

Shocking how it was turning on and functioning with shorted S4 rail. \n\nReplaced UB700 as it had short on PVCC line. R3501\/6 measured fine but had little dots on top. Replaced in case. \n\nThanks again"}
