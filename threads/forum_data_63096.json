I pulled <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> again and under the scope when touching up those pads on the board again there was a little thin layer of pink plastic ribbon on one of the pads. I looked at the bottom of <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> and there is a thin layer of pink plastic that was partially damaged and shifted. So I believe when I was pulling them and placing, I used too much heat that was causing that pink layer to get partially damaged. After cleaning up the bottom of <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> and touching up the pads on it with some solder prior to placing it back, the board now starts every time. From now on when I change a <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> I will use less heat and check the bottom prior to placing it on the board! Oy what a headache."
