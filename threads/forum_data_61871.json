        "message":"Hello. Got this board here. Lots of seawind corrosion on one of the edges. C9081 was shorted. Short cleared after removing it. I also have a short on C9087 line. Tried injecting voltage and U8800 gets very hot pulling 0.67A from PSU. If I plug in charger, board enters S0, stays \"on\" for some seconds and dies in loop. I'm suspecting bad NAND. Is there anything I can do to discard or confirm me guess?"
