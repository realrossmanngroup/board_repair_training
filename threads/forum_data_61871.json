I also have a short on <CAPACITOR>C9087</CAPACITOR> line. Tried injecting voltage and <CHIP>U8800</CHIP> gets very hot pulling 0.67A from PSU. If I plug in charger, board enters S0, stays \"on\" for some seconds and dies in loop. I'm suspecting bad NAND. Is there anything I can do to discard or confirm me guess?"
