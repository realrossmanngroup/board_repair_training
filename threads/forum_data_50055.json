            "message": "Have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that has the 216-0809000 GPU. Had typical GPU graphic problem. Replaced with NEW GPU from SEE-IC so no fake but had lines on a section of the screen and noticed piece of glue was stuck under the vram <CHIP>U8550</CHIP>. Tech accidentally pulled pad 152 and 153. These both seem important.\n\nWondering if it would be possible to move <CHIP>U8550</CHIP> over to <CHIP>U8450</CHIP> OR <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> since there are no vrams soldered there on this board with the 216-0809000 GPU for a fix or is this board trashed now?"
