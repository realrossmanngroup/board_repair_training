        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
