It only pulls 5V from ampmeter.\n\nI notice that one of the charging port was rebooting, and when measured, on U3200 (the on that was rebooting), I get, on diode mode, 0V on USBC_XB_CC1 and on USBC_XB_CC2.\n\nAfter replacing U3200, CC1\/2 gets 0.600V on diode reading, but still no power, and a black ampmeter on that port.\n\nPP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS_F has 0V on diode reading and 0.13 ohm to ground but because it is a high voltage line, i'm not sure if those readings are ok.\n\nF3010 seams to be ok.\n\nCan you help?"}
