It only pulls 5V from ampmeter.\n\nI notice that one of the charging port was rebooting, and when measured, on <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> (the on that was rebooting), I get, on diode mode, 0V on <SIGNAL>USBC_XB_CC1</SIGNAL> and on <SIGNAL>USBC_XB_CC2</SIGNAL>.\n\nAfter replacing <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>, CC1/2 gets 0.600V on diode reading, but still no power, and a black ampmeter on that port.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS_F</SIGNAL> has 0V on diode reading and 0.13 ohm to ground but because it is a high voltage line, i'm not sure if those readings are ok.\n\nF3010 seams to be ok.\n\nCan you help?"
