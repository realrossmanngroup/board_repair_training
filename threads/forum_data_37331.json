If both of those are reading that high, they are blown and need to be replaced. Remeasure between pins 27 and 28 and make sure it's a high resistance. If it's 0.8 ohms, then the ISL could be shorting the lines to ground or C7020\/21\/22 could be shorting it to ground.  There is also a chance the traces are blown between them and the ISL or them and R7020. Check traces and replace resistors."}
