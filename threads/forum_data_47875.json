I am still suspecting an smc issue...\nthanks"

            "message": "Hello 2informaticos, for the internal short, there was a burning hole right next to <RESISTOR>R5410</RESISTOR>, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was dead short to gnd. I gently scraped the burned hole and isloted the shorted track. This bring back normal diode mode 0,440 on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. I had to reroute 2 wires to <CHIP>U5410</CHIP> and of course to connect back with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>.\n\nNo I didn?t get <SIGNAL>5V_S5</SIGNAL> because <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> wasn?t anymore powered on it?s VIN pin 16. But this test let me find out that <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> was back steady and stable, this let me think that <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> when powered up is causing <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> to pulse continually.\n\nYes easy and good idea, I removed F7040 and tested L7030 voltage but it still 12,28V."
