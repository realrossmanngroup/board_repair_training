My issue is, I needed to replace the EFI chip, but the serial number on the chip didn't match whats on the bottom cover. The customer said he had the bottom cover replaced, hence the difference in serial number.\n\nWell, when i flash the chip with the serial number from the original chip, the comp. never boots, (i do have all voltages present and cpu warm). When i flashed the chip with the serial number on the bottom cover, i'm able to boot the laptop successfully and log into it."}

Upload the BIOS here and specify the serial number you want and I can make a known good BIOS for you."}

But for some reason when i do it with the original serial number (which was pulled from the computers EFI chip) the computer never boots. Only when i use the serial number on the bottom cover, which isn't the original bottom cover (bottom cover was replaced recently), this is when i'm able to get it to boot.\n\nAnyway, i've added a link to the file as i wasn't able to upload the .bin file.

Just curious what I was doing wrong. Does the bios I\u2019m modifying have to be unlocked to modify and if so, how does one find an unlocked bios?\nOr do I copy the bios data (except the ME region) from my locked bios and paste into the clean unlocked ME file?"}
