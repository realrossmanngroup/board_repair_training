Keyboard and Trackpad are not recognized in OS X but does work fine under the boot menu and ASD EFI. I have tried a fresh install of OS X but did not fix anything. Board shows no signs of liquid damage. ASD passes under both EFI and OS. Anyone have any idea what could be causing this?"

I suppose the keyboard or trackpad could have suffered some light liquid damage that i wasn't told about but it shows absolutely no signs of any liquid. Also some how i forgot to mention this but the left USB port does not work as well but I don't think that has anything to do with it as the keyboard still works under the boot menu."

Look at the data lines of the trackpad they end in the USB hub of the processor\/PCH as well as the other USB devices and ports do.\nDoes the faulty USB port works when the trackpad works?\n\nI'm thinking out loud: what if you sacrifice on functioning USB-Port and you use its data lines to connect the data lines of the trackpad to it...."

So im guessing either SMC_LSOC_RST_L or TPAD_USB_IF_EN_CONN was broken in the cable and is now a ground line on the other side. Either way I went ahead and ordered a new cable. Now to figure out this USB issue"
