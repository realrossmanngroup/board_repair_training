I'm in S0 State but <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWGD</SIGNAL> is missing because of low <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL>.\nAlready replaced <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> and C/R/<TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR>. Resistance to ground on <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> seems good (320 Omh).\nHere are the voltages of <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>:\nPin 06 :1.8V\nPin 12: 5.1V\nPin 16: 3.3V\nPin 17: 0.0V\nAlready checked all traces and solders around <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>... they seem to be ok.\n\nAny ideas what else could be the problem here?\nThanks and best regards\nDudi"
