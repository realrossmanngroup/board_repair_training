Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

Her HD boots externally, so I ruled that out. Her computer will not boot with any of my test drives, a known GOOD SATA cable, a known GOOD battery, or a known GOOD 85 Magsafe with and without the battery plugged in. I have seen the many topics regarding <CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR> in GPU panics and things like that, but I'm just curious can that cause the computer to not boot period? No evidence of any liquid damage anywhere on the board or in the machine has had the battery replaced before with a 3rd party battery, but even an Apple known good doesn't  boot the machine."
