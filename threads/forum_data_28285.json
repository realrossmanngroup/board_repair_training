        "message":"Have an 820-2914 that came in with computer not booting claims she \"crashed it\" moving pictures around. Her HD boots externally, so I ruled that out. Her computer will not boot with any of my test drives, a known GOOD SATA cable, a known GOOD battery, or a known GOOD 85 Magsafe with and without the battery plugged in. I have seen the many topics regarding C7771 in GPU panics and things like that, but I'm just curious can that cause the computer to not boot period? No evidence of any liquid damage anywhere on the board or in the machine has had the battery replaced before with a 3rd party battery, but even an Apple known good doesn't  boot the machine."
