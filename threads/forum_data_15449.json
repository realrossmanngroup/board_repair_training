I have a couple of donor boards but both <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> already taken. \n\nI want to order a single chip quickly from a UK seller rather than wait for more donor boards. Will any of these work?\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/2x-TI-<CHIP>TPS51125</CHIP>-TPS-51125-TI-QFN24-24-PIN-Power-IC-Chip-/111491523498?hash=item19f569a3aa:g:P6UAAOxykmZTNqby[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/<CHIP>TPS51125</CHIP>-Texus-instrument-<CHIP>TPS51125</CHIP>-TPS51125RGE-TPS51125RGER-51125-QFN24-/152424351766?hash=item237d330816:g:Ku0AAOSwux5YNNlW[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Texas-Instruments-TPS51125A-TI-Step-Down-Controller-IC-Chip-/121649755362?hash=item1c52e3f4e2:g:a~IAAOSwgkRVUjpC[/url]\n\nCheers"
