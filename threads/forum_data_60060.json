I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q5871</TRANSISTOR> being that it was one of the few areas to be hit. No change. Online test shows no issues. I've attached pictures taken before cleaning. The only other area that seemed to get hit was the backlight circuit and that's all good. Not sure where to go next.\n\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59457[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]59458[/ATTACH]"
