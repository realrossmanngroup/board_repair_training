I replaced Q5871 being that it was one of the few areas to be hit. No change. Online test shows no issues. I've attached pictures taken before cleaning. The only other area that seemed to get hit was the backlight circuit and that's all good. Not sure where to go next.\n\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59457[\/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]59458[\/ATTACH]"

The fan still spins up but Heatpipe Outgoing Air is now down to a normal 30C. Everything seems very clean and solid around U5860, and in general. Nothing burnt. No blown pads or traces. The spill was very minimal. I'm stumped why the fan is still spinning up."
