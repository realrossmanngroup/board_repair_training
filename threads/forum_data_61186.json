While plugged in if buttons are pressed like you are trying to enter DFU mode the apple logo appears and the machine boots successfully. At first it will seem fixed, you can shut down and press power button within a few minutes and boots up no problem. Battery checked and in good health.\n\nHowever if machine is left sitting for a bit the same problem returns. Does this sound like a T2 problem?\n\nPort needed to try a DFU restore currently is not working. usb amp meter does not even light up on this port, What needs to be checked first to solve that issue?"}
