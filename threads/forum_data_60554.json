        "message":"I was handed this machine with a replacement screen installed.   The original screen was cracked.\n\nThe L8570 melt down was so bad the trace is vaporized.   The PP5V_G3S line does show 5v.  I did not bother to replace L8570 just confirmed that PP5V_G3S was present.   The CPU VGT Phase 1 is never activated.  U7100 \"CPU_VR_EN\" is present as well as \"CPUVR_PGOOD\".  As a result the CPU does not enable screen voltage.\n\nThere is no modulation signal from Pin 11 of U7100 \"CPUGT_FCCM\" and the only CPU rail that is active is \"CPU VCCSA\"\n\nCould I be looking at a U7100 problem here?  I wanted to bounce my line of thought off the forum before I just start flowing parts off and on the board.  Seems to me a that a surge or damage to L8570 is a ways off from a U7100 failure.  I think I am missing something here.   I don't have much experience with this LB."
