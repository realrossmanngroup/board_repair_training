Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. ALL_SYS_PWRGD, PM_RSMRST_L, PM_SLP_SUS_L, and PM_SLP_S3_L are necessary prerequisites for CPU_VR_EN to be present. .",

The <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> line does show 5v.  I did not bother to replace L8570 just confirmed that <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> was present.   The CPU VGT Phase 1 is never activated.  <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> \"<SIGNAL>CPU_VR_EN</SIGNAL>\" is present as well as \"<SIGNAL>CPUVR_PGOOD</SIGNAL>\".  As a result the CPU does not enable screen voltage.\n\nThere is no modulation signal from Pin 11 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> \"<SIGNAL>CPUGT_FCCM</SIGNAL>\" and the only CPU rail that is active is \"CPU VCCSA\"\n\nCould I be looking at a <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> problem here?  I wanted to bounce my line of thought off the forum before I just start flowing parts off and on the board.  Seems to me a that a surge or damage to L8570 is a ways off from a <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> failure.  I think I am missing something here.   I don't have much experience with this LB."
