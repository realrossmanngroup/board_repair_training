If you use a lower wattage or shitty knockoff, <SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL> will be held low and the board will not start. \n\nLook on the power aliases page of the schematic. You need all \"Always Present\" G3H or G3 Hot rails before S5 rails. You need all S5 rails before S4 rails. You need all S4 rails before S3, and all S3 before S0. You likely are missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>, which requires <SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL> to be asserted to enable. \n\nThe random crashing is likely caused by failing CPU MOSFETs. Replace them with FDMF3030 chips after you solve the power issue. \n\nStop using that charger adapter and get a OEM Apple 85w MagSafe 2. You can cut the cord off and hook it to a DCPS if you want at a later time."

I'm still very much in the early stages of learning, so please understand that sometimes I may need additional information or something explained in a different way... I've always struggled, my entire life, when 1st starting to learn something new. I tend to start out learning really slow, and a lot of times I don't pickup on things when I read them. But once I'm going, I absorb information super fast, except for if I'm reading it.. (most of the time) I usually have to read something 4-5 times and very rarely can tell you what it was about or even recall parts of it. I'm an extreme example of a \"hands on\" type learner.. But enough about that.. Sorry for the side track there..\n\nThanks for the link to the \"How To Collection\", I'm going to review it now, then test around the board.  I'll report back once I'm done.

I Thought with only an 85w charger this board would get fan spin when operating correctly?\nI'm lost on what you're trying to tell me to do with the battery... I can't really test the board if its in the laptop connected to the battery, and 99% of all the macboard repair videos i've seen on Rossmann's youtube, he doesn't have a battery connected...\nSo I'm really misunderstanding something here...\nAnd with the numbers I posted from last night, are they good, bad, don't matter?  I'd like to know which are testing as they should if you could please let me know that as well.  \nAnd after reconnecting the mainboard in the chassis, i get this with the battery connected...  Now I'm taking the board back out. lol\nWith battery connected and charger:\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>=0.0v\n<SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL>=0.3v (with battery)\n<SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL>=0.0v(without battery)\nI'll check the PCH's RTC signals today... (once i figure out what that is)\nI hope everyone had a good 4th, and if you're celebrating today.. Than happy 250th US anniversary."
