First off, you need to use a OEM 85W MagSafe 2. If you use a lower wattage or shitty knockoff, PM_BATLOW_L will be held low and the board will not start. \n\nLook on the power aliases page of the schematic. You need all \"Always Present\" G3H or G3 Hot rails before S5 rails. You need all S5 rails before S4 rails. You need all S4 rails before S3, and all S3 before S0. You likely are missing PM_SLP_S4_L, which requires PM_BATLOW_L to be asserted to enable. \n\nThe random crashing is likely caused by failing CPU MOSFETs. Replace them with FDMF3030 chips after you solve the power issue. \n\nStop using that charger adapter and get a OEM Apple 85w MagSafe 2. You can cut the cord off and hook it to a DCPS if you want at a later time."}
