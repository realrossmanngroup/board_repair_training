The board was liquid damaged around <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>, the bottom left corner of the board near <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR>, the SMC RESET IC, and BADLY by the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>. Reflowed areas of corrosion and replaced almost any component left of the ISL as well as the ISL itself. I checked each individual pin for continuity throughout the circuit and all was good. Resistance between 17/18 and 27/28 is good both 20 ohm and 3 ohn measurements. The first time I did replace it, the ISL got SUPER hot, and I did not get a green light. I went ahead and replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> and the ISL again and now I'm back to square one on the problem with a green light that turns orange with no fan spin and only 1 volt on PPBUS. Measurements below at the ISL:\n\nDCIN: 18 volts\nACIN: 4.48 volts\nBCACOK: 3.3\n<SIGNAL>RESET_L</SIGNAL>: 3.3\n17/18: 3.9 ohms\n27/28: 20.9 ohms.\n\nAny and all help is appreciated \n\nThanks"

I have checked continuity from 6 and 7 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> to the other side of the board and I get continuity.\n\nIn diode mode with <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> on the board:\n\nPin 2: 0.557 on or off the board\nPin 7: 0.128 seems really low compared to donor, normal measurement consistent with donor when off of the board\nPin 6: 0.499 on or off board\n\nI checked my soldering, I have tried a few <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR>'s from an identical donor and a few Air boards (don't have anymore Retina boards I can try), and each time I put it on the board, the resistance measurements on PPBUS and <SIGNAL>CHGR_PHASE</SIGNAL> go down.
