Cleaned up and now getting a single quarter fan spin, no loop.\n\nI started checking for shorts, but am not exactly sure what is meant by that: if I am to measure short to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> do I also have to measure all the sub-circuits in that list, like <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_LPCPLUS</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_SMC</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H_BATT</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H_CHGR</SIGNAL>, PP3V42_G3H_ONEWIREPROT etc.? If not, I checked all the main rails and there is no short.\n\nAny ideas?"
