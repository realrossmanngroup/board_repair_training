Cleaned up and now getting a single quarter fan spin, no loop.\n\nI started checking for shorts, but am not exactly sure what is meant by that: if I am to measure short to ground on PP3V42_G3H do I also have to measure all the sub-circuits in that list, like PP3V3_S5_LPCPLUS, PP3V3_S5_SMC, PP3V42_G3H_BATT, PP3V42_G3H_CHGR, PP3V42_G3H_ONEWIREPROT etc.? If not, I checked all the main rails and there is no short.\n\nAny ideas?"}

First check all traces to U6100 and try a known good chip\/dump, save the old. CPU Vcore coming high during the fan pulse?"}

U6100 was replaced with one from donor board. Same issue. About checking rails for shorts: do I also need to test all the sub-rails or just the main ones?"}

Chips from donor boards are many times not good as they are erased."}
