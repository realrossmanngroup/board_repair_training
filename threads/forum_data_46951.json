The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

The customer claims, that he dryed it and it was working after that except one problem. He can start it and log into his account but as soon as he enters the OS Keyboard and Trackpad aint working anymore.\nI cleaned the (minor) corrosion and put it in the ultrasonic after that but no change so far. I know that keyboard and trackpad are connected via USB in BIOS and via SPI in OS (if i dont mixed that up) but would that explain that he can still log in?\nI had an Air here with similar problem but on that one i could not enter the password with internal keyboard (while keyboard was working in bios)...\nWith external keyboard and mouse everything works fine.\nAny help appreciated."

I dod not know the thing with file vault so i suspected a different problem...\nSo as this has to be a problem with SPI i checked all resistors and traces but everything is fine. Next i checked every pin of <CHIP>U4910</CHIP> and Pin 6 was 0V (i suspected 3,3V). I traced this back to <RESISTOR>R1630</RESISTOR> that is measuring fine (89kOhm) but has 0V on both sides. So i followed this to <CHIP>U8010</CHIP> (as everywhere where <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> should be was 0V - but as the board starts up it has to be there somewhere on the board).\nAt the end the probepoint between <CHIP>U8010</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R8011</RESISTOR> had a tiny crack threw it and fell off the board in 3 parts as i scraped it because i thought that that crack was a hair. So i ran a jumper and now everything works fine. Thank you very much.\nMark as solved please."

And since i fixed that problem the still present problem with the \"no trackpad and keyboard after standby\" is there it was only there after the waterdamage. So i assumed that it might be a board issue. But i`ll test a new cable tomorrow and hope for the best.\nMaybe its just that - maybe i cause it to die a few month earlier than it would have naturallly anyways by unplugging it a few times during the repair^^"

I`ll test this one for a few days and hopefullly i dont need to ask you again for help with this one.\nI`ve one more question: You don?t recommend to clean every board after repair in ultrasonic and if you use the ultrasonic only with sweep on?\nThank you very much for the fast reply(s) and the grerat help!"
