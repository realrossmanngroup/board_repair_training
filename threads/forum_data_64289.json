I put back the heatsink and the MacBook stopped working, after I removed it again and now it works fine.\n\nLooks like whenever the heatsink in on there is a short to ground on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> but when I remove the heatsink the short is gone which makes me believe that either a component under the heatsink might be touching the heatsink causing the short or perhaps the A2 pin under <CHIP>U0600</CHIP> on the top left or maybe the pressure from the bracket might be interfering with a component connected to the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> line causing it to short to ground when the heatsink is on.\n\nReally hope you can guide me to find the issue and get this board fixed.\n\n\nThank you"
