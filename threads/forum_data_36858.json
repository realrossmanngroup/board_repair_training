Was powering up but no keyboard. Fuzz around SMC and trackpad connector ribbon but nothing major. Ultrasonic cleaned and replaced the ribbon. Now I get a Magsafe light and no fan spin, chime or display.\n\nIt does respond to SMC reset though by switching to green and back to orange.\n\nPPBUS_S5 = 8.6v\nPP5V_S5 = 5v\nPP3v3_S5 = 3.3v\nSMC_PM_G2_EN = 3.4v\nRTC_G3H = 3.3v\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0v then 2.2v every 1-2 seconds < not sure whats going on here\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.6v\n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. Any help would be really appreciated."}

I went back and U1900, U6100 & U1950 connections didn't look great. Removed that and replaced the solder on all of them. J6100 looks perfect. Also fixed a broken GND TP behind U6100 (probably didn't need to) Anyway, it all fired up and works perfectly now. Thank you for your help"}
