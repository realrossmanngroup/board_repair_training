Was powering up but no keyboard. Fuzz around SMC and trackpad connector ribbon but nothing major. Ultrasonic cleaned and replaced the ribbon. Now I get a Magsafe light and no fan spin, chime or display.\n\nIt does respond to SMC reset though by switching to green and back to orange.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5</SIGNAL> = 8.6v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 5v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> = 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> = 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>RTC_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> = 0v then 2.2v every 1-2 seconds < not sure whats going on here\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 8.6v\n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. Any help would be really appreciated."
