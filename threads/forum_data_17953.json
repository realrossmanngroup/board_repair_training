        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",

        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "P5VS4RS3_EN_R": "What is P5VS4RS3_EN_R? P5VS4RS3_EN_R is an enable signal that turns on the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. The _R means the signal is asserted when the voltage is high(3.3v). .",

        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",

They seem to break for no god damn reason, or they're so fragile they just die if you look at them wrong.\n\nI'm working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that had no liquid, but won't turn on. Measuring around, I get all my s5 voltages, and <SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is present at <RESISTOR>R8141</RESISTOR>, but my pin 4 (<SIGNAL>P5VS4RS3_EN_R</SIGNAL>) of <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> is .196v. I can't recall what the enable voltage should be here, but I'm pretty sure it should be 3.4v. I changed <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR> together, and there's no change.\n\nI hate this model board, and have no clue where to go next. My other enables are present on <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>, but I believe this missing enable voltage is why I have no power.\n\nThanks in advance for any help."

It was .118v the very first time I measured it, then it went up to .198v, now it's a solid and steady 0v. All I've done is replace <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR>. I'll probably just ditch this one and move on, it's seeming like a nightmare."
