Made one good board out of two, but off course the donorboard has been fixed.\nIt's not possible anymore to setup Touch ID, although the power on\/off feature of that button still works.\n\nIs it possible to pair this touch ID with the new board? If not (as I can guess), is it possible to change the chip with the Touch ID data from the original board to the donorboard? If yes, in which chip is this touch ID data stored?\n\nI possess the touch ID button from that working donor board, but his flatcable has been cut off directly right against the little aluminium shield. So almost not repairable."}
