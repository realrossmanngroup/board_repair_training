I ultrasonic the board even if it looked clean, but 2 months later I have this problem.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8,6V\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL = 16,8V\nPP5V_S4RS3 = 0,9V, as PM_SLP_S4_L.      \nS4_PWR_EN is good\n\nHow can I find why I have a low voltage on this PM_SLP_S4_L ? I have no short on this.              \n\nThank you for your time"}
