    "definitions": {
        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",
        "SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "CHGR_RST_L": "What is CHGR_RST_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL is another way to say SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL, look at the definition provided for SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL as it applies to .",
        "C7050": "What is C7050? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for battery current sensing, you should measure around 2.202 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
