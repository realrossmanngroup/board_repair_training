            "message": "Hello. Got this board here that initially had no light on charger. It had been poked by another store already and had flux around <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> area. I managed to get green/orange light and 12.56V on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> replacing SMC and <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>. Now I have a full short to GND on <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> rail. Tried injecting voltage on that rail, nothing gets hot, so I started removing components. I removed <CAPACITOR>C1910</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C0890</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C0891</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C0892</CAPACITOR> and <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>, but short remains. I found after inspection that <RESISTOR>R5310</RESISTOR> was burned. I removed it and it has full short to GND on both pins. Injected voltage on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> rail and PCH gets hot. Dead PCH and RIP board?"
