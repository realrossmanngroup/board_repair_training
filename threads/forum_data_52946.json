        "message":"Like many of you I crawl around MacBook boards all day under a microscope and we find lots of things, Cat hair, human hair, dirt, water damage but Glitter?\n\nWhy do I always find either little gold, purple, red and some times green pieces of glitter. These particles are quite small. About the size of a 01005 resistor solder pad.\nI am wondering if you guys find this glitter? Is our world being polluted with micro plastic glitter and MacBook fans just suck it in? Maybe I am the only person who finds glitter?\n\nPlease share your Glitter finds!"
