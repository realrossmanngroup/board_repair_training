But it detects my EZCAST which is on the same network connected to my tv, nor detection of headphones. Otherwise the air works flawless even usb on I/O board.\n\nAny suggestions where to start\n\nI saw the bios has been tampered with, It also was the wrong flex cable between the I/O board and MLB.\n\nThanks"
