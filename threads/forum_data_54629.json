        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",
        "CPU_VCORE": "What is CPU_VCORE? Power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. .",

        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low)."

Also replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR>. Clock signal and vrtc accurate.\n\n\nAny clue?"
