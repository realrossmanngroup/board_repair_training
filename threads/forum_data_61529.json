There was a lot of crap underneath the U9080, so removed it. 2 pins were gone.\n- Connected power, 5V and 200mA, the C9080 was heating. Heard a crack, removed C9080 and C9081.\n- Connected power, 19V and 65mA. But all the caps on the PP2V5_NAND_SSD0 are completely short to the ground.\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"273px\"]60057[\/ATTACH] [ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"272px\"]60058[\/ATTACH]\n\nNot sure what to do next? \nIn past, I have seen multiple A1990 with NAND short issues."
