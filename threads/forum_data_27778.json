Any corrosion around it?\n\nYou might be missing a S0 power line or have a power line thats out of specification\nWhen probing this make sure the fan is spinning otherwise its not in a S0 state, so you might want to keep plugging the charger in and out to keep starting it back up.\nSo while the fan is spinning what are the voltages of:\n- <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP1V2_S0</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_REG</SIGNAL>"
