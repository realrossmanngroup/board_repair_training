            "message": "Hello,\n\nI received this MacBook. It was liquid damaged. Around the SMC (smc should be fine, this one has the underfill around the SMC).\nNo corrosion! Liquid damage around the LPC+SPI connector. I removed the connector before ultrasonic cleaning. I cleaned the \nboard, but still does not chime. \n\n<SIGNAL>SPI_MLB_CLK</SIGNAL> is missing. After a few second it comes on, but stays at 0V.\nAlso <SIGNAL>SPI_MLB_MOSI</SIGNAL> is missing. Is this a dead PCH? I know this could be SMC too, but how to find it out?\nI hate changing things especially if it's a BGA.\n\nThank you!"
