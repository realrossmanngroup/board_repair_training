    "definitions": {
        "820-3787": "What is 820-3787? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7105": "What is D7105? Diodes between PPDCIN_G3H charger voltage and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, when CHGR_DCIN Is low(less than charger voltage) and PPBUS_G3H is missing this is a critical point to troubleshoot.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U7001": "What is U7001? a CHIP.",
        "820-3738": "What is 820-3738? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. ."

I found <DIODE>D7105</DIODE> missing and after I put it back I get following measurements:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.43v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.27\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> = 3.3v\n\nStill no light on the charger, so I assumed maybe SMC issue due to low PPBUS, clearly it has been worked on as it has no glue around it. I do measure 3.43 on <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> if im correct this is a signal the SMC sends out? Suggestions? Change SMC or something else I need to check first?\n\nEdit: One wire circuit seems OK, i get 3.12v on Pin 4 & 5 from <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> not sure what it supposed to be here. And 3.28 on <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL>. 3.4v on Pin 5 of <CHIP>U7001</CHIP>"
