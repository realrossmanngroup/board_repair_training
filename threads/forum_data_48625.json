No light on charger and no PPBUS. I found D7105 missing and after I put it back I get following measurements:\n\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.43v\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.27\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3.3v\nSMC_RESET_L = 3.3v\n\nStill no light on the charger, so I assumed maybe SMC issue due to low PPBUS, clearly it has been worked on as it has no glue around it. I do measure 3.43 on SMC_PM_G2_EN if im correct this is a signal the SMC sends out? Suggestions? Change SMC or something else I need to check first?\n\nEdit: One wire circuit seems OK, i get 3.12v on Pin 4 & 5 from U7000 not sure what it supposed to be here. And 3.28 on SMC_BC_ACOK. 3.4v on Pin 5 of U7001"}
