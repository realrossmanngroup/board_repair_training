I reflowed the SMC regardless and gave it a love tap. No boot. I couldn't get my EZP2019 to flash a new bios to the chip so I swapped bios from different board and it now boots but running high fans so guessing may need cleanME which I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do. The chip appears to be a Micron 25Q064 which isn't an option and none of the \"close\" options are working either."}
