        "820-3209": "What is 820-3209? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC": "What is PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC? PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC Is a reference voltage for the SMCâ€™s voltage sensors & other sensors..",
        "PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC": "What is PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA": "What is PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA? PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state that powers the SMC that comes from PP3V3_S5. A blown or corroded L4901 inductor behind it can kepe it from working, inductor number will differ depending on your board. .",
        "PP3V3_S5_SMC": "What is PP3V3_S5_SMC? a SIGNAL.",

ASD passes and system is stable even after running CPU stresses or keeping it running for 30 minutes.\n\nOnly it has issues finding the SSD. Sometimes it finds the SSD and works for half an hour before the SSD is suddenly not found anymore and the system freezes. Reconnecting it sometimes works. When it works the SSD is fast so its not barely holding on or something, it fully works as expected until it just... disappears?\nAlready cleaned with a cotton swap in the slot and on the pins of the ssd in case there was any corrosion or dirt in there, looks clean if I use a flashlight to look into the pins.\nThe SSD looks like it was hit by the water though, there is a little bit of stickyness on the back but the side with all the circuitry looks mint.\n\nPossible issue with the motherboard or just another SSD that died because of one droplet of water?"
