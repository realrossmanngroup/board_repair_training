The board will try to boot (seems intermittent) and will show the Apple for a second and then show a circle with a line through it. At the same time, a bunch of random pixels will light up. The pixels change each time I try to boot. It looks like about 25 dead pixels spread randomly around the screen. Nothing else happening. I haven't seen anything like this before. Not sure where to go next."

I replaced <CAPACITOR>C7292</CAPACITOR>, and <CAPACITOR>C7290</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7293</CAPACITOR> look a little rough but are measuring fine. Is there a chance that one of these might be failing once power is applied? I've never know this to happen but I'm wondering if a capacitor could fail in this way, where it's intermittently shorting or partially shorting? I just can't find any other reason why this board is failing."
