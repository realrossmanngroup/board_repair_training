PPBUS_HS_CPU had a damaged capacitor. No short though. The board will try to boot (seems intermittent) and will show the Apple for a second and then show a circle with a line through it. At the same time, a bunch of random pixels will light up. The pixels change each time I try to boot. It looks like about 25 dead pixels spread randomly around the screen. Nothing else happening. I haven't seen anything like this before. Not sure where to go next."}

I'm hoping for some other magic fix being that the CPU is at least doing something.\n\nAlso, I had the number wrong. It's 820-00928. 2017 MacBook Pro 15\". Is someone able to fix the title for me? Not sure if it will matter as far as the outcome but it would be nice to at least get that part right."}

I purposely only used a soldering iron to avoid adding heat. No heat gun. The whole replacement was done in a matter of seconds. C7292 was already falling off the board so it was straightforward. I'll try to clean up those area with some flux and see if that helps."}

I attached a pre-cleaning picture of the area hit (and then pictures of the whole board, also pre-cleaning). This is the only area that was hit by the spill. Underneath that corrosion, the only components that look damaged were a few smaller capacitors. I replaced C7292, and C7290 and C7293 look a little rough but are measuring fine. Is there a chance that one of these might be failing once power is applied? I've never know this to happen but I'm wondering if a capacitor could fail in this way, where it's intermittently shorting or partially shorting? I just can't find any other reason why this board is failing."}

It's also booting, or attempting to boot, intermittently now, so sometimes I can't get it to the drive-select screen. And sometimes it seems to freeze. I'm not getting to the prohibition sign much anymore. I guess the assumption is that the CPU or VRAM was damaged from the spill even though it didn't hit the CPU or VRAM directly? It's completely clean around all of that."}
