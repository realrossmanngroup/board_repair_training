If I cant figure out what exactly is going on, I have to experiment or post here for advice. I check for voltage on the gate pin because I'm used to voltage showing up there on my MM.

Confusing.\nNow that I looked at it again, I see <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> is the main power source for <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> and pin 2 is at the top (where main VIN normally is shown on a schematic) for some reason.\nI don't understand why the chip that generates this rail also has it as an input, considering it looks to be getting feedback from pin 13 and 9 already.
