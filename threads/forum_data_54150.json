If I cant figure out what exactly is going on, I have to experiment or post here for advice. I check for voltage on the gate pin because I'm used to voltage showing up there on my MM. Why not?\nIn this case, the schematic looked to me like U7600 has PP1V05_S0 as both an input and also generates it through Q7630. Confusing.\nNow that I looked at it again, I see PP5V_S4RS3 is the main power source for U7600 and pin 2 is at the top (where main VIN normally is shown on a schematic) for some reason.\nI don't understand why the chip that generates this rail also has it as an input, considering it looks to be getting feedback from pin 13 and 9 already. So.. chalk that up to not having enough experience\/ not knowing enough, whatever.\n\nAnyway, continuity was ok, but now PM_SLP_S5_L and 4 disappeared. I reflowed the SMC and UC'd the board, but no help.\n\nPM_SLP_S5_L missing. no pulse\nPM_SLP_S4_L missing. no pulse\nPM_SLP_SUS_L missing\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN 3.3V\nPM_BATLOW_L 3.3V\nS5_PWRGD 3.3V\n\nPM_PWRBTN_L 3.4V\nPM_PCH_PWROK 0V\nPM_SYSRST_L 0V\n\nWhat is required for PM_SLP_SUS_L  to be generated?"
