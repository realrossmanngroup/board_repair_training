        "message":"I have two same 820-2915-B [with 216-0809000] that have same problem, they chime and even start OS [I can hear volume up\/down with 10.9] but they give no signal at display and no backlight.\nI have disconnected LVDS and tried with display port but without luck.\nThe first one had lines at display when brought in and I replaced gpu - after that the problem occured. So I reballed the vrams and reflowed the gmux also with no luck.\nNext I placed back the old gpu but still nothing happened. The used new gpu had been installed at another one and worked ok [I have a good stock of them] so someting else is happening here.\nThe second 820-2915-B was received with the exact same issue and neither me or anyone else has meshed with it yet.\nAbout some measurements,\n\nPPVCORE_GPU  1,10 V\nLCD_PWR_EN      0V\nPPVCORE_S0_AXG  0,45 V\n\nI have to mention that I had before one same case with 216-0810005 gpu but I had to return it as I thought that it wasn't common issue and didn't worth to spend time."
