So I reballed the vrams and reflowed the gmux also with no luck.\nNext I placed back the old gpu but still nothing happened. The used new gpu had been installed at another one and worked ok [I have a good stock of them] so someting else is happening here.\nThe second <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B was received with the exact same issue and neither me or anyone else has meshed with it yet.\nAbout some measurements,\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_GPU</SIGNAL>  1,10 V\n<SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>      0V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL>  0,45 V\n\nI have to mention that I had before one same case with 216-0810005 gpu but I had to return it as I thought that it wasn't common issue and didn't worth to spend time."
