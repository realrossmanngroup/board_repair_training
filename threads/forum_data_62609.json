            "message": "So i got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> in today - was originally fully shorted out stuck at 5V which I identified to a burned cap. Now the board turns on and works fine but the left fan as looking at it from the bottom runs at absolutely full speed (right one working normally) and also continues to run after the machine has been shut down. \n\nCustomer has clearly either taken this machine somewhere else or played with something themselves also as both the screen cable and the touch ID cables were ripped when I got inside. Cannot see any other visible issues however. \n\nIs this a board issue, fan issue or something else?"
