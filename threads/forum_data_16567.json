        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "PP3V3_S5_REG": "What is PP3V3_S5_REG? PP3V3_S5_REG is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H_REG": "What is PP3V42_G3H_REG? PP3V42_G3H_REG is another way to say PP3V42_G3H. PP3V42_G3H_REG and PP3V42_G3H are a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
