No Corrosion on the CPU/GPU Area luckily, but only on the backside of the board, concentrated mostly around UA600and <CHIP>U9801</CHIP>\n\nThere was a problem with RA602 being blown, which i think prevented the board from posting. After cleaning up corrosion in that area, reflowing <CHIP>U9801</CHIP> mostly,  and replacing the resistor RA602, the board boots. \nHowever it's terribly slow. \nThere is no higher than normal fan-activity, and HWMonitor doesnt report anything strange i think. (it reports 129C on CPU Core 8, but thats weird because this machine is a 6-core cpu) see attached photo for all sensors.\n\nI think it is being throttled, I cannot really verify with Intel Power Gadget, because that won't run on this newer macos (can't activate it's kext)\n\nIf i measure around <CHIP>U4800</CHIP> circuitry, i get <SIGNAL>SMC_PROCHOT_L</SIGNAL> signal (what i mean is: the signal is reading close to 0V)\nHowever i dont know what can cause this.\n\nI think the voltage divider for <CHIP>U4800</CHIP> (<RESISTOR>R4800</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R4802</RESISTOR>) is working,\n\nppbus is 12.6V\n\nvoltages of <CHIP>U4801</CHIP>:\npin 1 is 1.99v\npin 3= 1.20v\npin 4 = 3.3V\n\nvoltages for <CHIP>U4800</CHIP> are good, but pin 6 and 12 are low:\npin 1 = 3.3v\npin 2 = 3.3v\npin 4 = 3.3v\npin 6 = 0v\npin 9 = 3.3v\npin 10 = 1.2v\npin 12 = 0v\n\nDont know exactly how this circuitry should work, need a little help, thanks in advance!"
