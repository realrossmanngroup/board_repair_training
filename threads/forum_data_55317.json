        "message":"Translated\n\n\n\"In the initial phase the charging circuit receives only 5V from the charger. In this case, U7000 controls the Q7030 \/ 40 MOSFETs in Boost Converter configuration (step-up). Q1 is always closed (ON) and Q3 \/ 4 perform the SMPS switching functions; Q2 remains open (OFF), does not intervene. In step-up mode, U7000 can generate 13V on F7000 even with 5V input on the USB-C port. Once SMC starts working and detects the correct charger, U7000 controls the Q7030 \/ 40 MOSFETs in Buck Converter configuration (step-down). Q4 is always closed (ON) and Q1 \/ 2 perform the SMPS switching functions; Q3 remains open (OFF), does not intervene. The charger voltage in this mode is not necessarily 20V, as shown in the diagram. Depending on the actual power of the charger, it can deliver a voltage of 15V, or 20V. \"\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo based off that information the ISL9239 should power up PPBUS without the SMC's input?"
