A burnt inductor was obvious on the LB.\n\nRepaired the damaged traces and was able to return power to <SIGNAL>PP5V_MAIN_ALSCAM_F</SIGNAL> at J8550 but still no display.\n\nThese machines come in for damaged displays and when they replace the screens and they still don't work I end up with them.  I was  wondering if anyone has figured out what else gets damaged when this goes.   There is a similar fault on the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and my repairs have met a similar fate.   All the rails on J8550 are present and the machine does boot just no image."
