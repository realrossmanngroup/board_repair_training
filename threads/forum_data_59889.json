I connected a speaker to be certain and I did hear a chime.\nNow, the next day, the board doesn't boot anymore.\n\nI'm not quite sure what to do from here. I can't really consider removing all the stuff on the <SIGNAL>3V3_S0</SIGNAL> rail until the 130Ohms to ground goes away, there's just too much stuff.\nSo any suggestion would be more than welcome :)"

            "message": "I don't really know the history. I got this board from a joblot off ebay. At first it was totally missing <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>, with a dead short to ground. There was clear signs of liquid spill in the corner near the headphones jack, and especially, the microphone ribbon cable connector looked really nasty.\nSo I removed that connector and cleaned the pads. Then I got what I described above, which is no longer a dead short but still not quite a normal resistance for that rail.\n\nI've already looked at all the caps on that rail, and none of them really look bad, unfortunately.\n\nIf there's crap under a BGA chip, I guess it could be the audio codec, since it's pretty close to the area where the dead short was.\n\nBut I noticed one thing, though. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is created from <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> through a mosfet switch. I do see 1.8V on the S0 rail, but the S5 rail has a clean 3.3V.\nShouldn't the short also drive the S5 rail down to 1.8V ? This makes me think I should maybe replace the mosfet for the S0 rail. Would you agree ?"
