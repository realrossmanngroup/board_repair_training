        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

LCI indicators are all triggered. Cleaned with alcohol and inspected through microscope for any burned evidence.  When power is applied I get an orange light, fan spin and a battery charge icon on the LCD panel.  After a few seconds it shuts down.  No light on USB mouse when plugged in during start up.  Haven't worked on one of these before so any pointers would be helpful on where to start."
