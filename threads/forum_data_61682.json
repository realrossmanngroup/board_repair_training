Liquid damage is cleaned.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> had a short to ground with 13.7Ohm. The same value i measured at L7270. So i changed <CHIP>U7270</CHIP> and the Short was gone and i have 20V on the charger.\nThe problem now is that <CHIP>U7270</CHIP> gets real hot. The board takes something over 1A.\n\nThe original <CHIP>U7270</CHIP> on the board was an FDMF5812, the schematic shows an SIC532CD. I changed <CHIP>U7270</CHIP> now two times. The first time i took a SIC532CD from a donor. The second time i took a new SIC535 with same problem. \n\nI'm not very good in understanding mosfet circuits and need some help."
