Liquid damage is cleaned.\nPPBUS_G3H had a short to ground with 13.7Ohm. The same value i measured at L7270. So i changed U7270 and the Short was gone and i have 20V on the charger.\nThe problem now is that U7270 gets real hot. The board takes something over 1A.\n\nThe original U7270 on the board was an FDMF5812, the schematic shows an SIC532CD. I changed U7270 now two times. The first time i took a SIC532CD from a donor. The second time i took a new SIC535 with same problem. \n\nI'm not very good in understanding mosfet circuits and need some help."}
