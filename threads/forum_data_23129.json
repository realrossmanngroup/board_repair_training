        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "R7780": "What is R7780? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_PLT_RST_L": "What is BKLT_PLT_RST_L? a SIGNAL.",

        "R7788": "What is R7788? a RESISTOR.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled.

This must be dealt with before we touch the LED driver or anything else \"after\" <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>. \n\nP channel mosfets here will open when the voltage on the gate is lower than the voltage on the source. <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> needs less voltage on pin 3(gate) than what is on pin 4(source) to open. If pin 3 and pin 4 have the same voltage on them it will not open.\n\n<RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR> takes pin 4's 8.4v and puts it on pin 3. <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> turns <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR> into a VOLTAGE DIVIDER so that the voltage on pi n3 is LOWER than the voltage on pin 4 which is required for this <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> to send voltage to output(pins 1/2/5/6)\n\nIf the voltage on pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is the same as the voltage on pin 4, 1 of two things is happening.\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> is not giving <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> the path to ground it needs so that it can act as a voltage divider. This can occur from either <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> being bad, or <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>BKLT_PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL> not being present.\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> has a short circuit between pins and 3. This can occur if Q770 goes bad or if <CAPACITOR>C7782</CAPACITOR> short circuits and turns into a wire.\n\nIf <SIGNAL>BLKT_PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL> is 3.3v and <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> are 3.3v, then that rules out those signals. So what you are left with is either a bad <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR>, bad <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7782</CAPACITOR> being shorted, or <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> being shorted.\n\nYou said <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> measures correctly, so this leaves <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> being bad, <CAPACITOR>C7782</CAPACITOR> being shorted/bad, or <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> being bad.\n\nWithout power applied, what is the resistance between pins 4 and 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>?\n\nIf you short <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> pin 2 to ground, do you get a backlight?\n\nThere is no point in visiting <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> or the <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> resistors before getting power flowing through <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> to the circuit. <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> resistors <RESISTOR>R7731</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7715</RESISTOR> get their power FROM <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> so if <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is not opening there is nothing to even troubleshoot yet."
