Still no backlight.\n\nWhere should I be looking next?\n\nR7780 is good.\n\nQ7706 has 8v on 3 & 4 but nothing on 1,2,5 and 6.\n[\/QUOTE]\n\n[QUOTE=\"gcain, post: 23161\"]BKLT_PLT_RST_L = 3.3\nEDP_BKLT_EN = 3.3\n\nR7788 & R7789 measure correct.\n\nImage is present.[\/QUOTE]\n\nWe cannot trouble any of the backlight boost circuit if it is not yet getting power. Q7706 is what supplies power to the backlight boost circuit, and it is outputting nothing. This must be dealt with before we touch the LED driver or anything else \"after\" Q7706. \n\nP channel mosfets here will open when the voltage on the gate is lower than the voltage on the source. Q7706 needs less voltage on pin 3(gate) than what is on pin 4(source) to open. If pin 3 and pin 4 have the same voltage on them it will not open.\n\nR7788 takes pin 4's 8.4v and puts it on pin 3. R7789 turns R7788 into a VOLTAGE DIVIDER so that the voltage on pi n3 is LOWER than the voltage on pin 4 which is required for this Q7706 to send voltage to output(pins 1\/2\/5\/6)\n\nIf the voltage on pin 3 of Q7706 is the same as the voltage on pin 4, 1 of two things is happening.\n\nQ7707 is not giving R7789 the path to ground it needs so that it can act as a voltage divider. This can occur from either Q7707 being bad, or LCD_BKLT_EN\/BKLT_PLT_RST_L not being present.\n\nQ7706 has a short circuit between pins and 3. This can occur if Q770 goes bad or if C7782 short circuits and turns into a wire.\n\nIf BLKT_PLT_RST_L is 3.3v and EDP_BKLT_EN are 3.3v, then that rules out those signals. So what you are left with is either a bad Q7707, bad R7789, C7782 being shorted, or Q7706 being shorted.\n\nYou said R7789 measures correctly, so this leaves Q7707 being bad, C7782 being shorted\/bad, or Q7706 being bad.\n\nWithout power applied, what is the resistance between pins 4 and 3 of Q7706?\n\nIf you short R7789 pin 2 to ground, do you get a backlight?\n\nThere is no point in visiting U7701 or the BKL_EN resistors before getting power flowing through Q7706 to the circuit. BKL_EN resistors R7731 and R7715 get their power FROM q7706 so if q7706 is not opening there is nothing to even troubleshoot yet."}
