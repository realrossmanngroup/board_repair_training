With a fresh drive, and fresh install of Catalina, no issues. With the customer's original drive\/install, I was also able to cause it to crash simply by closing the lid and waiting 10 seconds. Every time on the customer drive\/install, this would crash it. With my new drive\/isntall, no crashing. Gave it back to the customer with a fresh install.\n\nHard to say if it was the software... his drive in one of my units would not crash. Very strange."}
