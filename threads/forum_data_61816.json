        "U3540": "What is U3540? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "AP_RESET_L": "What is AP_RESET_L? AP_RESET_L resets the wifi hardware when it is low, which will keep it from working. AP_RESET_L needs to be high for reset to not be asserted.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v..",
