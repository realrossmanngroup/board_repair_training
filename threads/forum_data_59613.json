When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",

I checked the ISL and SCL, SDA lines and they measure .529 on Diode and 3.42V. I tried other batteries but still draws 3 Amp with battery plugged in."
