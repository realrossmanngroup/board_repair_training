The board works but when I connect to 85W magsafe it will not turn on. It will turn on with either a 60W or my lab bench PSU 85W plug made from genuine MS2. I checked the ISL and SCL, SDA lines and they measure .529 on Diode and 3.42V. I tried other batteries but still draws 3 Amp with battery plugged in."}

Replaced it, now running off of all chargers with a green\/orange MS2 light. Still have another issue though. The charge current still wants to run away. It starts low then ramps up to 3 Amps, which is the limit for this power supply. So far I have replaced D7012 and now R7012. Still have some hunting to do. I swapped a different board for the client so this one belongs to me now."}
