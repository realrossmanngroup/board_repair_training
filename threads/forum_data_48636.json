Reflowed the SMC chip and replaed the display connector, now I get 8.59 and fan spins, stops, spins again and keeps spinning (not 3 x though). I do have CPU clock. Can this be related to <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>/traces, or is that only an issue if no fan spin at all?\n\nEDIT: All SPI Bus Series Termination tested seems OK:rolleyes:, also have USB activity"
