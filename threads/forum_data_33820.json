In fact it’s the second board which I've failed to fix with the same symptoms.\nBoth of these boards are the result of being dropped.\n\nThe issue is I cannot get an image out, either externally or the LCD.  (<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.3V)\n\nThe board powers up, chimes, can be PRAM reset.\nI get <SIGNAL>ALL_EG_PGOOD</SIGNAL>, so the power side of the GPU is ok.\nI’m basically missing <SIGNAL>LVDS_IG_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL>. Which is generated by <CHIP>U1800</CHIP>.\nI know its not the PCH, I swapped this out on the 1st board. I also replaced the GPU.\n(I usually dont start swapping stuff out)\n\nYou can see I’m out of ideas, its probably hopeless, as I’m beginning to think this issue is inside the board.\nI thought I’d try here to see if anyone has solved this.?"
