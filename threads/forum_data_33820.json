In fact it\u2019s the second board which I've failed to fix with the same symptoms.\nBoth of these boards are the result of being dropped.\n\nThe issue is I cannot get an image out, either externally or the LCD.  (SMC_LID is 3.3V)\n\nThe board powers up, chimes, can be PRAM reset.\nI get All_EG_PGOOD, so the power side of the GPU is ok.\nI\u2019m basically missing LVDS_IG_PANEL_PWR. Which is generated by U1800.\nI know its not the PCH, I swapped this out on the 1st board. I also replaced the GPU.\n(I usually dont start swapping stuff out)\n\nYou can see I\u2019m out of ideas, its probably hopeless, as I\u2019m beginning to think this issue is inside the board.\nI thought I\u2019d try here to see if anyone has solved this.?"}

If this was after a drop I think you already know it is most likely a ripped trace under the CPU\/GPU. Check diode mode on all the caps in the PCIE lanes from CPU to GPU. Could also be balls\/traces under the MUX."}

I checked PCIe lines with a known good board and they are all fine. \n\nI might as well re-ball the CPU, what have i got to loose, already about 4-5 hours deep into this."}
