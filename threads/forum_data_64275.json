I replaced about 20 or so capacitors in this area.\nWhen I put everything back together, everything on the board was working, including the keyboard caps lock light. But when I sealed it up all the way, the caps lock light no longer was working, the fans were going at full speed, and I noticed the LCD screen would not come on unless I pressed the power button once, then it would light up for about 1 second, then go black. If I pressed the power button again, it would again light up for 1 second and go black. I troubleshot some more, and whenever I unplugged the keyboard, the screen would stay on longer then 1 second, acting normal. \nI probed the keyboard JT200 pin 5, and only when the keyboard was plugged in did I get what I thought was a short. I have since ordered a new keyboard but with this keyboard I am getting the same thing. \nRT119 Is getting voltage. I don't know where to go from here."
