But i get no keyboard backlight as just assumed it wasnt doing anything.\nIve tested the screen/ screen cable with another board, and they are good. but i will rebuild the system and see if i get anything on an external.\n\nAlready have all the correct adapters for USB-C /USB and external displays."
