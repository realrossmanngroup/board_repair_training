Have tested new keyboard as well.\n\nTest points on keyboard connector:\n\n\nPin 4 (PP3V42_G3H_TPAD) = 3.42v\nPin 5 (WS_KBD_ONOFF_L) = 3.3v\nPin 30 (PP3V3_S4_TPAD) = 3.3v\n\nAny ideas on what to test \/ check next?\n\nKind Regards"}

Also check the data lines to the trackpad I2C_IOXP_SCL and SDA. Make 100% sure you trackpad and cable are good as that is the most common cause."}
