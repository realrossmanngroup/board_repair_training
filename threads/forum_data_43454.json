The customer wanted to know if data recovery was possible, but I can't think of any ways to get to it if the CPU is dead.\n\nI typically do not mess with data recovery at all, for many reasons. But this is a good friend, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Is there any way to access their information for transfer with a dead CPU? I was thinking of just connecting it to another Mac via USB-C with the dead unit powered on (it will stay powered, just freezes\/scrambles-out on boot), but I imagine the unit must boot in order to be accessible as an external\/target-disk drive.\n\nAny ideas?"}
