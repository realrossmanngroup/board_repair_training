        "A2179": "What is A2179? A2179 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2020 with EMC 3302, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01958..",
        "820-01958": "What is 820-01958? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook won’t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SOC_FORCE_DFU": "What is SOC_FORCE_DFU? a SIGNAL.",
        "1V8_SLPS2R": "What is 1V8_SLPS2R? a SIGNAL.",

I've also cleaned up the area around the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>, replaced some missing resistors and also pulled off the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> and reballed it (was liquid damage underneath). Put everything back together and now if the battery is not connected i'm getting a 5v 0.25a current draw and nothing further (<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.3V seems low to me). With battery connected i'm getting 20V and 0.00a current draw and PPBUS is only 10.3V. Device is not recognized in DFU mode. Not sure where else to go with this one as it all seems clean every other part of the board - even around the second <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> is very clean can see no issues there. The 1.8v, 1.1v and 0.9v sleep voltages appear present and stable."

            "message": "No liquid on either touch ID or audio board both clean. All testing I did so far was with those two disconnected anyway - only had the charger alone or the charger and battery connected.\nLooking at the power on sequence it gets up to <SIGNAL>PP3V_G3H</SIGNAL> which is present and stable at 3V. <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> is missing and there is no enable signal going to it. Thermal cam shows the T2 is heating a tiny amount when power is applied (Maybe 3-5 Degrees higher than rest of board)\n\nI'm unsure if this is a case of dead T2 or the <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> Circuit is damaged - I notice a lot of pins under the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> which was corroded are connected to <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL>. Presumably if the <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> isn't being generated then the enable signal would turn off automatically. No shorts are visible on <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL>."
