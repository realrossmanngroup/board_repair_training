        "A1706": "What is A1706? A1706 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3071, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00239, 820-00923..",
        "820-00923": "What is 820-00923? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created..",
        "BKLT_SDA": "What is BKLT_SDA? BKLT_SDA is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",
        "PP5V_S0_BKLT_A": "What is PP5V_S0_BKLT_A? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP5V_S0_BKLT_D": "What is PP5V_S0_BKLT_D? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_SW": "What is LCDBKLT_SW? a SIGNAL.",
        "U8510": "What is U8510? a CHIP.",
        "DP_INT_HPD": "What is DP_INT_HPD? a SIGNAL.",
        "EDP_INT_AUX_N": "What is EDP_INT_AUX_N? a SIGNAL.",
        "5V_S0SW_LCD": "What is 5V_S0SW_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "EDP_INT_AUX_P": "What is EDP_INT_AUX_P? a SIGNAL.",
        "3V3_S0SW_LCD": "What is 3V3_S0SW_LCD? 3V3_S0SW_LCD is a 3.3v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state that powers the LCD screen image circuitry. This is necessary to get an image on the screen."
