No backlight. Went over Rossmann's no backlight sticky...\n\nI have 8.4 volts at left side of L9701 and 0.033V on the boosting side.\n\nI did have an F'd up LED driver. Half the pad was still there, but the connection between the pad and the trace was gone. I ran a TINY jumper to the pad and it looks perfect.\n\nStill turns on and no backlight. I checked for continuity on all the broken trace suggestions in the sticky and I don't know where to go from here.\n\nR9731 is fine and I do get 2.9v at BKL_EN.\nBacklight fuse is fine (unfortunately)\nConnector doesn't look damaged at all, and I've tried known (cracked) good working LCDs (at least my backlight test screens.)\nI have 5v at PP5V_S0 and 3.3v to the LED Drvr\n\nany help? I tried two different LED drivers due to swapping out to a smaller jumper to FB ball. No change."}

It would suggest an open coil but more likely bad measurements.\nYou should have checked the feedback trace A5 when the LP8550 was off."}
