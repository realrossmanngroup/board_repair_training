        "U8400": "What is U8400? a CHIP.",
        "LCDBKLT_FB": "What is LCDBKLT_FB? LCDBKLT_FB is a feedback line between backlight output and the feedback pin on the LED driver. When this connection is broken, backlight output will be equal to PPBUS_G3H voltage of the system rather than boosting. Since this point is the highest voltage in the system, it is the fastest to corrode when liquid damaged, so it is a very common point to check when there is no backlight. .",

        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",

I checked <CAPACITOR>C8400</CAPACITOR>, <RESISTOR>R8401</RESISTOR>(80.6k) and <RESISTOR>R8402</RESISTOR> all good so the voltage divider works good no issue there and when measured direct pin 3 to 4 on <TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR> it's 80k. I have input on <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> on pin 5 and 18 i don't have output. All resistors around <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> are good expect <RESISTOR>R8432</RESISTOR> which should be 150k but it's 24.1. I removed it but then when measured directly it's 150k and i get diode value on <SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_FB</SIGNAL>. Also i noticed that <RESISTOR>R8440</RESISTOR> which should be 1m it's 0.86 on 1m scale. Ideas?"

When you connect the charger it display fine on the screen the battery level but when you power on the device it display on the background but no backlight. I have tried to plug external screen with usb c adapter but no luck. The backlight IC  system seems to be working fine gives 51v-54v on <DIODE>D8410</DIODE> when its on but doesnt want to  give backlight image on. i have tried to go on recovery mode but it doesnt seems to be working that either.
