I get PPbus_G3h, green light on charger, PP3v3_s3 is there as well, but no _s4 power rails. PP5VS4_EN on U7501 is only 0.4 V. Also resistance to ground on PP3V3_S5 is 50 ohms measured from L7560. When i plug in the charger U1100 gets hot, so i suppose this is the culprit. Are these chips generic? or do i need one from a donor board?"}

Start with replacing that first. BIOS will also need fixing if you get this board going again, but that is the least of your worries."}

If not, then its lottery if you get a good one from usual places. \n\nOnce PCH is replaced and board works, we can help you in fixing the bios."}

I slapped it on the board, and the short to ground is gone. The machine seems to respond to smc reset, but i am still not getting PP5VS4_EN, or any of the higher power rails.. does this have to do with the clean ME region that the smc needs? Or should the machine boot if everything is ok?"}
