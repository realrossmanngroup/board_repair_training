        "message":"I have a liquid-damaged 820-3476 that appears to be working fine except the fan spins up high as soon as it receives power. It doesn't matter what is plugged into it. It boots normally, doesn't really seem obviously slow. I ran the online Apple test and it came back with just a fan error. New fan doesn't change anything. I pulled off the diagnostic connector but other than that I haven't done any repairs. Just ultrasonic. I attached pictures if anyone has any ideas of what could be causing this. Not sure where to go next with it."
