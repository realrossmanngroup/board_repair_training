It doesn't matter what is plugged into it. It boots normally, doesn't really seem obviously slow. I ran the online Apple test and it came back with just a fan error. New fan doesn't change anything. I pulled off the diagnostic connector but other than that I haven't done any repairs. Just ultrasonic. I attached pictures if anyone has any ideas of what could be causing this. Not sure where to go next with it."
