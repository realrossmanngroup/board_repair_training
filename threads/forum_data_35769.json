        "820-3462": "What is 820-3462? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_PLT_RST_L": "What is BKLT_PLT_RST_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR": "What is PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR? PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR is PPBUS_G3H after it has passed through a backlight fuse and a transistor that allows power through when BKLT_PLT_RST_L and LCD_BKLT_EN are present. .",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."

            "message": "hello im working on a water damage MacBook <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3209</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that turns on but it doesn't show an image on the screen. Im getting 0v on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> and 12v on f9700. From what I can see, <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> isn't producing <SIGNAL>PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR</SIGNAL>. I tried replacing this mosfet but I still have the same problem. I did some further diagnosis and noticed the following voltages were present  <SIGNAL>BKLT_PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL> 3.32 <SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL> 11.67 but <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> was missing. what can be causing this? I dont have a open line on this line? Any suggestions?"
