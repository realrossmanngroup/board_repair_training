Im getting 0v on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT and 12v on f9700. From what I can see, q9706 isn't producing PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR. I tried replacing this mosfet but I still have the same problem. I did some further diagnosis and noticed the following voltages were present  BKLT_PLT_RST_L 3.32 LCDBKLT_EN_L 11.67 but LCD_BKLT_EN was missing. what can be causing this? I dont have a open line on this line? Any suggestions?"}
