        "HALL_SENSOR_LEFT": "What is HALL_SENSOR_LEFT? HALL_SENSOR_LEFT is a signal from the hall sensor on the left side of the machine that indicates that the lid has been closed. This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen."

I am not sure how to proceed.\n\nNOTE: Liquid damage around <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> resistors was repaired but issue pre-dated this charging fault. \n\nThank you in advance"

            "message": "Very strange. The issue is no longer present.\nEven after an upgrade from High Sierra to Monteray, the issue had persisted.\nOnce booted without trackpad and 3.5mm board connected (which I believe houses the other sensor), SMC reset was performed, connectors brushed off and reconnected and it now works. I should mention that I had previously disconnected and inspected the connectors but did not brush them off (they looked great and were clean) nor perform an SMC reset in between reconnecting them.\nI am not complaining, I just wish I knew what did it...\n\nThank you very much for getting back to me with help.\nShould I delete the thread or leave it as strange as the \"solution\" may be?"
