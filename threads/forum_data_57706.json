I?m just trying to learn these repairs and I?m sorry the majority of the boards are old. Anyway I replaced d7005 one of the diodes was no good it had continuity in diode mode in both direction while the other side did not pin 3had 0 continuity to r7005 so I ran a wire. I u7200 had a short to ground on pin 16. Test pin 16 without u7200 .469v Replaced u7200. No I have a green light on the charger and ppbus_g3h is turning on every 30 seconds almost as if it?s sensing a current draw and shouting down.\n\nU7000\nchgr_dcin = 16.59v\nchgr_acin = 4v\nsmc_bc_acok = 3.3\npp5v1_chgr_vddp =4.9v\nchgr_rst_l =3.41v\n\nu7200\n5v3v3s5_reg3=\n3v3s5_entrip="}
