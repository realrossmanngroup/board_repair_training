        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",

        "PP1V05_S5": "What is PP1V05_S5? PP1V05_S5 is a 1.05v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. On 2008-2009 15” and 17” Macbook boards, this often gets stuck at 0.3v due to a bad C7771 capacitor. .",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "R7050": "What is R7050? Current sense shunt resistor for the battery, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 17/18 on ISL6259 should give you 2.02 ohms. .",
        "Q7030": "What is Q7030? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "Q7035": "What is Q7035? a TRANSISTOR.",

        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "R7012": "What is R7012? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7000": "What is R7000? a RESISTOR.",

        "Q7085": "What is Q7085? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD.."

It's an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with no power:\n\n1. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> bounces from 12.6v down to 0v, then back up. <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> is also pulsing, as are my S5 rails.\n2. <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> stable at 3.42v. Green light solid.\n3. Resistance at <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> (17/18, 27/28) is normal (~3ohm and ~20ohm). Pin 3 of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> solid (does not bounce/fluctuate).\n4. No power from charger or battery, however, PPBUS does NOT pulse when a battery is connected only (i.e., with battery plugged in, ppbus stays steady), however, the board still will not power on with battery.\n5. I can't find a short anywhere; I've checked <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S5</SIGNAL>, PPBUS, PP3v42, etc. Couldn't find a short anywhere that might be causing the board to cycle.\n6. <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is stable at 3.4v, however, it drops to 3.3v for a split second every time the board cycles/rails fluctuate.\n7. I replaced the SMC, but no change.\n8. I replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> simultaneously (pin 23 fluctuates, but pin 3 does not, so I thought maybe <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> were having issues), but no change.\n9. <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> measure fine.\n\nReally at a loss on this one. I'm still leaning towards a short somewhere, but I don't know where else to check. Any help with what direction to go would be appreciated--thank you as always!"
