I have replaced <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>, <CHIP>U1845</CHIP> <CAPACITOR>C1924</CAPACITOR>, <RESISTOR>R5689</RESISTOR>. Those were the only components that looked like they have been affected by the water. I get green light on magsafe, and The First missing line is <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>. All of the Rails before that one are present and correct. <SIGNAL>CPUVSENSE_IN</SIGNAL> appears to be shorted, with a diode measurement of .009v. I'm kind of lost where to go next with this..."
