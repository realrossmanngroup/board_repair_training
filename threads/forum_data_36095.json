I have replaced u1900, u1845 c1924, R5689. Those were the only components that looked like they have been affected by the water. I get green light on magsafe, and The First missing line is PP5V_S3. All of the Rails before that one are present and correct. CPUVSENSE_IN appears to be shorted, with a diode measurement of .009v. I'm kind of lost where to go next with this..."}
