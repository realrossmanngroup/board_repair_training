            "message": "Are you logged in as root on your Linux system? Not sure if the kernel is trying to follow the JHFS+ filesystem's permissions, because that would explain why you can't touch the files as they're not owned by your user. You can't just copy the system over with support of your Linux machine though, too many file attributes that might get lost.\n\nJust a wild guess, but I think you might have luck just copying the files back from the terminal in the Internet Recovery OS. I don't know the precise instructions but it would go something like this:\n\n0. Before we start there needs to be a working installed version of OSX on the internal SSD as we need a working boot loader partition.\n1. Boot into Internet Recovery (Not a local recovery partition!) and Format the Internal SSD's Mac OS partition so there is a clean empty JHFS+ filesystem in Disk Utility. If it doesn't want to, you can use the terminal with the command line tool \"[I]diskutil[/I]\" with a command like this: \"[I]diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ OSXSSD [B]/dev/disk2s1[/B][/I]\". Before running this, make sure the internal drive is indeed [B]disk2[/B], with the second partition ([B]s1[/B]) being the MacOS one with the command \"[I]diskutil list[/I]\", double check this as it will otherwise wipe something else\n2. Open the terminal in Internet Recovery OS, it should be running as root. Run this command:\"[I]cp -av /Volumes/[B]<SIGNAL>NAME_OF_USB</SIGNAL>[/B]/[B]<SIGNAL>PATH_TO_BACKUP</SIGNAL>[/B]/* /Volumes/[B]<SIGNAL>NAME_OF_INTERNAL_SSD</SIGNAL>[/B]/[/I]\". Again make sure everything is correct, forgetting 1 character can have totally different results. If you can't find the internal SSD or USB, mount the partition in Disk Utility. ([U]Note:[/U] [B]<SIGNAL>PATH_TO_BACKUP</SIGNAL>[/B] should be the backup location containing the root level folders such as etc, var, usr)\n3. Running the copy command will probably take a while depending on the speed of the flash drive. If its finished in less then a minute either you or I did something wrong, it should output each file its copying.\n4. Reboot the device and see if the system is even remotely interested in booting from it.\n\nKeep in mind I have never tried this, but other then this I'd have no ideas left on why its not working. Let me know if you need help with one of the commands or if you were successful. Good luck"
