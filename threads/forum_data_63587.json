            "message": "I have this really weird problem.\n\nScreen is 90% black (from bottom to top, only top bar is visible). I changed it with another from a donor but there was some dimmed and almost black lines on top. I tested his original display on another Macbook and it works perfectly fine, so I thought maybe it was a LCD cable issue. I assembled it back but screen doesn't turn on at all. I tried with the replacement one (with the dimmed spots) and it doesn't turn either.\n\nCurrently it doesn't light up with both of the displays. It has picture on external monitor, so I know it's booting.\n\nAny idea what to look for?"
