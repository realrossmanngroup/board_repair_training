        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook won’t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "R5170": "What is R5170? a RESISTOR.",
        "PLT_RST_L": "What is PLT_RST_L? This is an abbreviation of “PLT_RESET_L” – when you see “PLT_RST_L\", assume the person meant to type PLT_RESET_L.",

This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",

Had to replace both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> chips and some caps and resistors around them to restore 20v and the board boots. Everything was working fine including the power button, so I sold the laptop to someone. 3 weeks later, it was returned to me because they could not get it to turn on. When I tested it, it would only turn on when you connect a charger to it. It does not automatically turn on when you open the lid or when you press the power button. Also, when the computer is on, I cannot turn it off using the power button at all. I have to do SMC reset to get it to turn off. I tested the board alone with just a charger connected and tried to trigger <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>, and <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> stays at 3.3v and the board does not turn off. I also tried to trigger <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> also stays at 3.3v and the board does not turn off. I am thinking there is an issue with the SMC but wanted to confirm first before changing it."
