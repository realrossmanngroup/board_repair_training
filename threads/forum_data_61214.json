This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

I was getting only 5v on the charger and 450ma, which is high. I replaced <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>, but still had 5v 450ma. I checked the board on thermal, and saw <CHIP>U9580</CHIP> was getting hot. Replaced <CHIP>U9580</CHIP> and got 20v, but all my AWAKE and SLPS2R voltages were pulsing. Checked on thermal again and saw <CHIP>U7660</CHIP> was getting warm. Replaced <CHIP>U7660</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> and now I have steady voltages on all my rails up until S5. I am missing <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>. I tried T2 firmware restore and it is recognized in DFU mode, but quickly fails and produces an error. Does this mean the PCH is at fault, or is there something else I should check first?"

My previous post was incorrect when I said I have steady voltages up until S5. I now noticed that all my AWAKE and SLPS2R voltages still pulse, but they stay steady for about 20 seconds and then pulse, so I was not holding my probe there long enough to catch the pulse. PPBUS is 12.6v for 20 seconds or so, and then drops to 12.3v for about 2-3 seconds and then goes back to 12.6v. No pulse on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, but <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_LDO</SIGNAL> is 5.13v and the pulses down to 5.02v when PPBUS drops. I cannot find any shorts or anything heating up abnormally on thermal, so not sure where to check next."
