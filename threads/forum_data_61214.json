I was getting only 5v on the charger and 450ma, which is high. I replaced U3200 and U3100, but still had 5v 450ma. I checked the board on thermal, and saw U9580 was getting hot. Replaced U9580 and got 20v, but all my AWAKE and SLPS2R voltages were pulsing. Checked on thermal again and saw U7660 was getting warm. Replaced U7660 and U7650 and now I have steady voltages on all my rails up until S5. I am missing PP3V3_S5 and PM_SLP_S5_L. I tried T2 firmware restore and it is recognized in DFU mode, but quickly fails and produces an error. Does this mean the PCH is at fault, or is there something else I should check first?"}

My previous post was incorrect when I said I have steady voltages up until S5. I now noticed that all my AWAKE and SLPS2R voltages still pulse, but they stay steady for about 20 seconds and then pulse, so I was not holding my probe there long enough to catch the pulse. PPBUS is 12.6v for 20 seconds or so, and then drops to 12.3v for about 2-3 seconds and then goes back to 12.6v. No pulse on PP3V3_S5, but PP5V_S5_LDO is 5.13v and the pulses down to 5.02v when PPBUS drops. I cannot find any shorts or anything heating up abnormally on thermal, so not sure where to check next."}
