            "message": "[h=2][/h] Hi have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3662</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that had liquid spill few weeks ago with charging issue, turnt out to be the battery so i thought as when replaced with new unit all was ok , well for a couple of days anyway. Here's the original post so you can see what was done/checked and rechecked again now. Problem seems to be the same , with battery disconnected laptop will boot and run fine, with battery connected it will only boot to apple logo but what i have noticed with the battery installed the cpu gets extremly hot very fast, ive tried different chargers and 2 new batteries with same result, anyone got any clues i cant put it to the bottom of the pile anymore :-)\n\nHi i have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3662</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board with a charging issue, laptop will boot to login screen, shows battery percentage and charging icon but as soon as you enter the password and hit enter the laptop restarts, if i disconect the battery it will boot to os, it will not turn on by battery power either, so ive changed <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> checked current sensing both charging side and battery side and just out of frustration changed <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR>, oh and also reset pram just incase :-( anybody got any clues"
