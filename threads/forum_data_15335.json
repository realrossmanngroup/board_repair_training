Here's the original post so you can see what was done\/checked and rechecked again now. Problem seems to be the same , with battery disconnected laptop will boot and run fine, with battery connected it will only boot to apple logo but what i have noticed with the battery installed the cpu gets extremly hot very fast, ive tried different chargers and 2 new batteries with same result, anyone got any clues i cant put it to the bottom of the pile anymore :-)\n\nHi i have an 820-3662 board with a charging issue, laptop will boot to login screen, shows battery percentage and charging icon but as soon as you enter the password and hit enter the laptop restarts, if i disconect the battery it will boot to os, it will not turn on by battery power either, so ive changed isl6259 checked current sensing both charging side and battery side and just out of frustration changed q7155, oh and also reset pram just incase :-( anybody got any clues"}
