            "message": "Hi guys, got this 2936 board with no USB. After initial troubleshooting i found J4600 had 5V on L4605 and J4610 not on L4615. On both USB mouse was not working though. Found a short to ground on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_RTUSB_B_ILIM</SIGNAL> so replaced <CHIP>U4600</CHIP> (5V was going in on 2/3 and out on 8 but 9 nothing), <CAPACITOR>C4617</CAPACITOR> <CAPACITOR>C4615</CAPACITOR> and L4615. After this short gone and voltage back. Now J4610 is all fine and J4600 show a light on the mouse but not working yet. Going to check datalines next but i need to figure how this works so any tips for speeding up my learning curve are welcome."
