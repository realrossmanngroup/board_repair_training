But the working for 20-40seconds -> not starting was from just to now.\nThe turn off was also not based on temp of the cpu, all I could verify.\n\nMaybe i take it back about temps? Since I have just been probing some testpads around the smc and the <SIGNAL>PM_THRMTRIP_L</SIGNAL> is at 0V. I assume that means thermal protection and comes from the cpu, but the heatsink is on and cold."

The charger also buzzes like that when I accidentaly shorted the magsafe power pin to ground. Also 60W.\n\nI would like to check some of the boot sequence Voltages. Can you give me a short rundown of what signals are important for startup and in which order?"
