            "message": "Hi,\n\nBoard had a slight water damage. Cleaned it in utrasonic. Evertything seems to be working except for switching it on with power button (the button works). To turn it on I have to disconnect battery and MAgsafe adapter. When reconnect magsafe it turns on again and works normally. If I shut it down I can switch it on again with power button. I have to reconnect magsafe. If I press power button the light on magsafe goes to green and then back to orange (like during smc reset) but macbook doesnt switch on. If I press power button while OS is ON it immediately switches macbook OFF. I wonder what can it be... hmmm. Please help.\n\nThank you!"
