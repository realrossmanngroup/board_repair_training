I got 19v and 0 amp. FOund a short in PPBUS, smoke out of U7960 when put power in it. I replaced U7960, short is gone. Now when I connect power I dont get 19v anymore only 5v, I do have 13v on PPBUS now..... :rolleyes:. Since 19v showed up before I assumed nothing is wrong with the USB control chips, but now it changed to 5V should i be looking at those? Or if U7960 is shorted the CPU is fried? PP3V3_G3H = 3.4v"}
