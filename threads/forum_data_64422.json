        "message":"First of all, welcome to the forum!\n\nYou don't really need exact voltage for all points of schematic\/boardview.\nIn time, you will acquire the knowledge to understand them.\n\nMany times in schematics the name of a power rail indicates expected voltage.\nFor example, is clear that you \"hunt\" for 1.2V on PP1V2_S3 rail; or 3.3V for PP3V3_S5.\nMake difference between power rail and its related signals.\nP1V2REG_VREF is a reference voltage output of the controller chip; you can find its value from IC datasheet.\nP1V2_DRVL\/DRVH are PWM signals, 5V amplitude visible with o-scope; never check them on the Gate pins.\n\nThe enable signals for some power rails may have 3.3V, or 1.8V depending where they come from.\nDoesn't matter if controlled power rail has 3.3V, 5V, or 0.9V...\n\nFlexBV software may help you in your repairs.\nPaul Daniels posted a lot of readings for almost all MacBooks boards for free.\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https:\/\/openboarddata.org\/[\/URL]\n\nFor personal training contact Rossmann group staff."
