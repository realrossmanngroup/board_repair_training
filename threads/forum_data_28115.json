Received a working MBA the other day, along with a new MB to do a data transfer too.\nTransfer went fine using migration assistant.\nLast night I left the MBA on doing a time machine back before wiping it and installing high Sierra.\nBooted fine this morning, stuck in my live thumb drive that has high Sierra to install.\nBooted to efi partition - hung on Apple bar screen at about 90%\nPulled thumbdrive and powered off the machine. Switched USB ports, option - per and once the apple dong stops - it dongs again and again.. Indefinitely.\n\nSMC reset and pram reset didn't do anything to help.\nPulled ssd, wifi\/bt, battery. Still same symptoms.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nAny suggestions on where to go from here?\n\nOnly previous work history reported from user was due to 100% full ssd. Had the apple store clear it up for her. I do see some fingerprints on odd places internationally though. Going to pull the motherboard and check for any heat damage\/probably bios area first.\n\nIll keep you guys posted and give you the motherboard number once I get the board out. (820-3209-a)\n\nUpdate: fan spins fine. Isl sense resistors are ok, no water damage anywhere. Bios resistors are reading what I would expect. Going to bust out the microscope and bv\/schem to start checking voltages, but not sure what to look for in this case."}
