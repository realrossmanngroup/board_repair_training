I can see the laptop has been already opened by someone. Even the display assembly also opened. I have an A1706 display spare for testing, Will it work?. I don't have an A1989 working display to confirm the failure. \nI couldn't find the backlight flex cable broken physically.\nIs there a way I can confirm the issue, I don't know whether it is the problem with the display or motherboard?  \nI can see the display image if I use a mobile flash light."}
