Port \"A\" is not working. customer states they plugged something into it and it stopped working. I took the board out, looked around and do not see anything burnt. He thinks the actual port is blown but I don't see how. I see there are 2 <CHIP>CD3210</CHIP>'s for the ports. Is that a good start to check? or should I be looking elsewhere?"
