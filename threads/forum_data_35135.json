Best to replace Q7080\/30\/35 and the ISL all at the same time to avoid issues. That will likely fix the PPBUS issue. The quarter spin my guess would be current sensing so need to measure resistance between pins 17\/8 and 27\/28 of the ISL6259"

Q7035 also is not shorted, i've compared with a good known board.\nThe same for Q7080\nAll that to say maybe only the ISL is bad no?"
