        "A1706": "What is A1706? A1706 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3071, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00239, 820-00923..",
        "820-00239": "What is 820-00239? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT is PPBUS_G3H backlight voltage entering the backlight boost circuit once the transistor has been told to allow it through. .",
