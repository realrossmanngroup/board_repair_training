Ran in ultrasonic cleaner but after it would first turn  for a few seonds, turn off then back on. I noticed <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> had some corrosion which I scrubbed off then it would turn on with the fan at high speed, no image on the screen.\n\nAfter removing <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> I noticed pin 1 and 3 pads are missing from the water damage. Do I need to run a jumper wire from <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> to fix this problem? If so to which part do I run it to?"
