Ran in ultrasonic cleaner but after it would first turn  for a few seonds, turn off then back on. I noticed D6905 had some corrosion which I scrubbed off then it would turn on with the fan at high speed, no image on the screen.\n\nAfter removing D6905 I noticed pin 1 and 3 pads are missing from the water damage. Do I need to run a jumper wire from D6905 to fix this problem? If so to which part do I run it to?"}

Although this will probably not fix the board as bad D6905 would cause totally dead board. I see some pretty corroded resistors too...."}

Should I put the board in the ultrasonic cleaner again for the corroded resistors? I have a new D6905 to replace the old one."}
