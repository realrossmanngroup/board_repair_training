So far I've tried:\n\nAll ports, though focused mainly on the left port closest to trackpad as instructions indicate.\nOriginal thunderbolt cable (with lightning symbol)\nOriginal magsafe charger cable (no symbol)\nBelkin cable\nanother off-brand cable\n\nWhen I use the non-thunderbolt cables, I get the message ''cannot use thunderbolt accessory. connect accessory using a thunderbolt-capable cable''.\nWhen I use the proper thunderbolt cable, I get nothing. No device is seen in apple configurator. Host machine runs catalina, i'm fairly sure the broken board does too.\n\nI've tried getting into DFU mode both with juse the loose board, nothing attached (this has worked for me on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01041</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board from an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> before), but I also tried with the assembled device. Is there something else left to try here?"

The Target Mac will remain as a black screen but you should see the DFU box pop up in Apple Configurator window on the Host Mac. \n\nStill nothing on the mac running apple config (original or non original cable)"

I don't have a keyboard or flatcable for these new machines lying around so its difficult to test further right now. I think I'll abort this one, as the customer has already decided to give up on repair for this board.\n\nmaybe of note: According to system information on the host, none of the thunderbolt ports have a device connected (no matter which port I connect the macbook to)"
