        "message":"Macbook came in with the costumer not naming one clear cause. The fan spins for 1 second then turns off,  it's taking 25mA not entering S4 state. Here I have some measurements.\n\nPP5V_S4RS3 = 0V\nPP3V3_S4 = 0.31V\nPP3V3_S4SW_SNS = 0.01V\nPP3V3_S4_TBTAPWR = lowering to 0V\n\nThinking about replacing TPS51980 but since the fan does spin for a short second I think it is an active short somewhere which makes it get to S0 and then stop.\n\nIs replacing TPS51980 then still my best bet or does this fan activity point to something I overlooked?"
