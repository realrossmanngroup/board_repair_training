I am sure we have all seen this.\n\nAfter I fixed it now I get a \"Wrong Way\" sign after it shows the apple logo for a second. What is wrong way?\n\nI have tried my test SSD and my external USB test drive. Both have the same problem.  The SSD is APFS the external is the old file system.  Both show a apple logo for a second."
