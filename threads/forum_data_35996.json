Glad to be part of this forum. It's my first shot with macbook reapairs so please have some patience with me.\nI normally do playstation 4 repairs, eveything from smd rework to reballing and so on.\ni decided i wanted to give it a shot with macbooks as well since its a good business especially in the country i live in where there's no competition.\nI bought a macbook a1398 advertised as faulty with gpu artifacts. After speaking with the seller he said that no attempt of repair was made so i decided to buy it. Unfortunately when the product arrived i saw that the board was slaughtered. there are no returns for this so i have to take it as it is and figure something out.\n\nafter searching online i saw that i was not the only one having this specific issue, but i did not see anybody actually resolving it, since most took the laptop to the apple replacement program.\nbasically the screen has red horizontal lines distortion mostly where black background is supposed to be. it does not boot to os, continuously restarts after displaying the last text you see in the picture taken at verbose mode.\nThe previous \"repair person\" tried reflowing the GPU, all VRAM, U8900, U9100 and i think maybe even CPU and other components.. You can see how he left the board in the pictures attached.\nI first reballed the GPU because i had to see if he did not mess something up because i found a solder ball right next to it. after taking it off, i found a few oxidated pads, but unfortunately that did not solve the issue.\nAfter putting everything back together it still does the same.\nThere are 2 things i noticed. When he removed the glue from the VRAM he made a small cut in the PCB, about 1mm. as far as i can see there are no traces affected ( I do not have a microscope, only a powerfull magnifier). Can someone please confirm if there are traces there or not.\nAlso, some components near the VRAM were not soldered properly: C8532 and C8208 . C8524 and C8574 were completely missing. I replaced them with a random capacitor from an ipad 4 board as i do not know what value they should have and if it matters.\n\nI suspect that i have a dead GPU or faulty VRAM. I did not try reballing the VRAM, I would replace them but i dont have 256mb DDR5. i only have 512MB chips from PS4\nAlso I ordered a new GPU N13P-GT-W-A2 from ebay UK.\n\nPlease let me know if i am on the right track or if you have any suggestions. also if you saw something like this before please let me know.\n\nPS: friday i have another A1398 coming in with no video."}

On ps4's if the APU is bad, there is no way to replace it with a new one as it is married with 3 other chips. so basically you have a scrap board. this way even if somebody kills the chip before you there is still a chance to fix it. I am confident that this issue can be fixed, i'm not really sure it's the GPU, but i thought its the right thing to start with. also there is no video on HDMI, i'm not sure if it is supposed to be while booting, but there is no signal coming out at all."}

I bet the problem is that there is still some glue under the VRAM and that messed up the balls. If there are traces in the 2nd layer I have no idea. If you want to be sure you can get new VRAM, I would wait with replacing the GPU with that Ebay one as the original is probably better. The Ebay one could be a remarked fake one."}

I have just finished reballing the VRAM. nothing changed. I believe that the VRAM was reballed or changed before. it was quite clean underneath but i am 90% sure they had leaded solder balls. Also, it's very obvious that in the deep scratch some copper from a trace can be seen. as far as i can tell it looks intact. i tried touching it with the multimeter probe on diode mode to find out where it goes but could not find out. i do not want to make the hole bigger only as a last resort, if nothing changes after GPU replacement either...\nalso i replaced the two capacitor mentioned before with same as original values 0.1uF , 6.3V from an iPhone board. now eveything seems to be in place.\ni was able to fully install windows on the machine, but the graphics is even more terrible (i see 4 small screens aligned to the left of the monitor and then just rainbows) and i can not see on which card it's running on. one thing i noticed is that the GPU gets very hot and the fans are almost all the time at full speed.\nwhere i can get some VRAM blocks? do they work from other laptops as well? how about putting bigger size (this i think should not work)."}

They are so densely packed that there are many buried vias the you cannot even see. Many pads under GPU\/VRAM are directly on top of a via so putting any mechanical stress on them will separate them from the via and still look fine.\nJust order some VRAM from China and a donor board or 2. Yes it will take 2-3 weeks, but that is just how this is."}

I have to make sure that i have the right ones and that i order the right ones as well.\nmeanwhile i tried to activate intel GPU in windows without success since the only method i found has to have a working copy of MAC OS.\nI attached a picture so you can see how windows looks like. the resolution is fixed on 800x600, can not be changed.\nAlso the video card 650m is detected and installed but shows error 43 in device manager and GPU-Z can not detect any RAM and no frequency on it...\none thing i do not understand is why the print screens show up fine? should they not be distorted as well? i can not get image on external display i tried the HDMI cable and also thunderbolt to hdmi. it says no signal all the time."}
