Got this board that was turning on but giving constant KPs related to GPU. As it's a common problem on this model, I re-soldered U8900 and replaced some resistors\/caps around U6201 as they were corroded. Now the machine does not turn on anymore. I noticed Q8930 was getting very hot, so I replaced it and at first time the board turned on, gave backlight but no VCORE\/Video(brain dead). After I plugged off the power the machine did not turn on anymore and Q8930 started boiling again. I replaced it again alongside Q8931 and Q8961 as they were also gettin warm. Still no power and still boiling hot Q8930. I get only 1,5V on PPBUS_G3H and short to GND on L7030. If I replace Q8930 the short goes away, but as soon as I plug in the charger again the short comes back and Q8930 starts boiling. Any ideas? Dead GPU?"}
