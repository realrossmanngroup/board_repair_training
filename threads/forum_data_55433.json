        "message":"Hi Team,\n I have this machine came with No trackpad and keyboard except power button working.\nReplaced the trackpad and the flex going to the motherboard,\nnow the keyboard works fine but the trackpad is acting weird: the center area is like sensitiveless,  also once I had the mouse cursor flickering and moving by itself on the screen.\nI've reinstalled the OS, but I still have this centered area not working properly.\nI've tryed with a trackpad for a 820-00045 board (macbook 12 2015 ) that normaly are not compatible, this one had only the left side working properly.\nIt's very confusing when wanted to order the right Part Number on the net because both models have the same PN.\n\nNow I just would like to know if it's an issue related to my motherboard or just coming from the trackpad itself  which can be  solved by replacing it once more......\n\nregards"
