I have cleaned up the board, and I found a short on the <CAPACITOR>C9072</CAPACITOR> pin 1 which does correspond with the two nand chips <CHIP>U8700</CHIP> and <CHIP>U8600</CHIP>. Thermal camera shows <CHIP>U8700</CHIP> is getting the hottest, but both are getting pretty hot. I have removed <CAPACITOR>C9072</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C9071</CAPACITOR> (one side was singed), and <RESISTOR>R9067</RESISTOR>. Is there anything else that could cause these NAND chips to heat up like this? These two chips appeared to be sealed in the board. Thank you in advance."
