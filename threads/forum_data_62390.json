        "message":"Have a 820-01958-A with liquid damage\/corrosion. I have cleaned up the board, and I found a short on the C9072 pin 1 which does correspond with the two nand chips U8700 and U8600. Thermal camera shows U8700 is getting the hottest, but both are getting pretty hot. I have removed C9072, C9071 (one side was singed), and R9067. Is there anything else that could cause these NAND chips to heat up like this? These two chips appeared to be sealed in the board. Thank you in advance."
