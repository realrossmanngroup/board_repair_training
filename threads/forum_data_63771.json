I know the a1502\/a1466 you have to use a transcend jet stream otherwise you will have sleep issues, so I wanted to make sure the a1278 isn\u2019t similar.\n\nwe\u2019ve gota a1278 in atm with the typical intermittent question mark folder. Sometimes you get it in cold boot other times it\u2019s fine it boots to the os than after a hour or so it reboots and goes to the question mark folder. We were able to do a Time Machine backup and we\u2019re able to restore it but that hasn't resolved the issue. Is there anything else I should be checking before replacing the hdd?\n\nthanks for your assistance."}

We\u2019ve replaced the ssd, they actually had a hp ssd in there already so we replaced it with a Samsung.\n\nis there any particular test that seems to trip up the question mark folder more than others? We ran unigine overnight to try get it to fail but it\u2019s still going so I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any other tests we can try? Or should we just replace the cable out of precaution? I\u2019m a bit reluctant because we don\u2019t have them in stock and the customers a bit antsy to get his laptop back."}
