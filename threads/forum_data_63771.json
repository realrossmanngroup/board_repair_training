I know the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> you have to use a transcend jet stream otherwise you will have sleep issues, so I wanted to make sure the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> isn’t similar.\n\nwe’ve gota <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> in atm with the typical intermittent question mark folder. Sometimes you get it in cold boot other times it’s fine it boots to the os than after a hour or so it reboots and goes to the question mark folder. We were able to do a Time Machine backup and we’re able to restore it but that hasn't resolved the issue. Is there anything else I should be checking before replacing the hdd?\n\nthanks for your assistance."

            "message": "Ah of course sorry didn’t think of that. We’ve replaced the ssd, they actually had a hp ssd in there already so we replaced it with a Samsung.\n\nis there any particular test that seems to trip up the question mark folder more than others? We ran unigine overnight to try get it to fail but it’s still going so I’m wondering if there’s any other tests we can try? Or should we just replace the cable out of precaution? I’m a bit reluctant because we don’t have them in stock and the customers a bit antsy to get his laptop back."
