If so, this will always be a little off. If it is not causing the machine to run slow, then who gives a shit\n\nIf it is causing slowness, then try a 60w adapter, and see what happens, but this should not cause slowness\/lag\/problems."}

You can tell real and fake apart by connecting it to a machine. A fake one the green light will come on instantly on a real one there will be a 1 second delay.\nThere is no real reason for this sensor to read high unless you are using an 85W charger or a Chinese knock-off."}
