This does not stay. After I unplug the power and plug it back in I'm back to 3v on pin 3 and <SIGNAL>PP3V3S3_EN</SIGNAL> not present. Now, even with my 3v rails being present , I still did not get CPUVCORE. Checked <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> and found I was only getting .361V on <SIGNAL>VMON_Q4_BASE</SIGNAL>. Though I was getting 3.3V on pin 6, 1.074V on pin 5, 1.497V on pin 7 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR>. All this doesnt matter because once i unplug I lose my 3V S3 rail.
