After ultrasonic cleaning and replacing the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> PPBUS was restored (12.57V). With several known good 85W real MagSafe Adapters and DC-In boards the board only gets a green light that does not change over to orange. I have made sure that SMCRESET is not low or cycling. I have also made sure that the resistance between 17/18 and 27/28 of ISL is in spec. I do no have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> and the TPS and <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> were burned and were replaced as well with all associated MOSFETs. I have never seen the green light come on but not reset with an SMC reset or change to orange. Could this be a bad SMC?"
