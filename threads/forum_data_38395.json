        "message":"I've got an A1502 (820-3476) that had some liquid damage around the top edge of the board. After ultrasonic cleaning and replacing the ISL6259 PPBUS was restored (12.57V). With several known good 85W real MagSafe Adapters and DC-In boards the board only gets a green light that does not change over to orange. I have made sure that SMCRESET is not low or cycling. I have also made sure that the resistance between 17\/18 and 27\/28 of ISL is in spec. I do no have PP3v3_S5 and the TPS and U8080 were burned and were replaced as well with all associated MOSFETs. I have never seen the green light come on but not reset with an SMC reset or change to orange. Could this be a bad SMC?"
