        "message":"Hi guys.\n\nI have this 820-00840 which is powering on normal but after 5min the picture goes crazy and the CPU overheats. The fan spins in the beginning but stops and doesn't go on again. The board is clean no liquid damage. I replaced the thermal paste just in case and also tried a new ssd with a new installation but gets stuck when counting. Any ideas?\n\nThanks"
