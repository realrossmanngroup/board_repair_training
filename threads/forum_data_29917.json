            "message": "this came in dead, no power. Found corrosion around thunderbolt port. Cleaned and replaced what was bad and unit now powers on and passes all tests I throw at it. The backlight acts a little funky though. \n\nBacklight only activates once progress bar starts loading under the Apple logo, not before that. \n\nAlt-boot, during hardware test and as mentioned the first 5-10 seconds of boot it stays off. Once it kicks in it stays on. \n\nSMC reset and PRAM reset didnâ€™t fix it. \n\nAny thoughts?"
