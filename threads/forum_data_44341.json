            "message": "Basic problem fault:-\nCustomer gives me the above mentioned MBA 4.2 claiming a battery issue and \"virus\" on the hard drive.\nInitially plugged in the magsafe and the LED went green but failed to power on. I did an SMC reset and it powered on. However, it runs horrendously slow. Rebooted to the diagnostic ( see thread in tools as wanted to get this version of ASD) and which ever option I choose, basic or full the ASD crashes. With the basic it crashes after 1min 29 sec's and on full at 56 mins 23 sec. Repeatedly at the same time. On one occasion when I left the trackpad cable off ( for diagnostic purposes) the fan when high rev's.\n\nI opened the base, tho and behold there has been liquid ingress. Removed the logic board and apart from stickyness in a couple of places, there is no corrosion.... anywhere.\nI have tried another trackpad cable, trackpad and keyboard. I have also used USB keyboard and mouse. ASD gets to the same time place and crashes.\nIn the O/S everything is operational but slow. Booted off an external drive with an O/S on, same result in the O/S. Unable to get hold of ASD ver 3A225 as I wanted to try to run it but not off of the SSD.\n\nArea around the JTAG is clean.\nDC board to Logic Board ribbon ( not sure what you call it) although liquid indicator has been activated the connections are spotless as are the connections on the 2 board but as a precaution I swapped out the DC board and ribbon.\n\n\nAny pointers please on where I should be looking next.\nThank you."
