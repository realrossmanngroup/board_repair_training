Everything works normally. Not liquid-damaged. Computer works fine on battery. Power button works fine with adapter plugged in. But the power button will not do anything with only the battery connected. Tried known good battery and keyboard. No change. Installed working board and everything is normal. Any ideas?"}

Power button will actually turn off computer with battery-only but it will not turn it on. Turns on and off fine with charger. There is no sign at all of spill-damage but I did just notice that the SPI looks like it was messed with. Not sure if that might have changed things and could be causing this. Or maybe something in the surrounding area was affected when the SPI was removed and resoldered."}
