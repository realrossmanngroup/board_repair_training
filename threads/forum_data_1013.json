Before re-installing the SMC, can I inject 3V42 on the line, say on pin 2 of L6995? (Pin 1 is not shorted to ground).\nHow about ISL? The old one was bad and I removed it. Should I solder a new one in place first? Would like to know for this case and future reference what I can leave off when injecting current.\nNot sure if helpful, but I measured resistivity of <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> to ground and found it to be around 33 Ohm on pretty much most parts of the line.\nThe board is not WD. It seems it was killed by a bad MagSafe connector or charger. It was worked on before, as it came with the B/L driver missing. The owner said it was harvested and asked me to put one back if the board powers up."

Removed it and removed <CAPACITOR>C6994</CAPACITOR> and found that pin 9 is still shorted to ground and resistivity of the line to ground is still 33OHM. So the short to ground is down the line.\nCan I keep <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> off the board and re-inject 3V42 on pin 2 of L6995? I would think so...\nEDIT: after looking at the schematics I decided to go ahead and inject 3V42 from IBM desktop power supply because my bench DCPS can dump 20 AMPS in case of short. I found <CHIP>U5755</CHIP> to be shorted (very slightly warming up). Removing it relieved the short. Gonna test and report back."
