I noticed while I was inspecting the board that there were signs of rework there already and I really don't think this is a customer diy type of thing but the reason I am posting here is that the SMC is completely flat against the board. Is there some technique that people are using to solder chips like this without reballing? I would have assumed it was some kind of failed attempt at soldering the chip if it wasn't actually powering on booting to the login screen. Here is a picture to show what I'm talking about."}
