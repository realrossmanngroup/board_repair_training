It is possible to remove C1910 first to see if this is the short? I can remove U1900, but this is more difficult for me. If C1910 is the cause and is removed, I'm assuming I should see PPVRTC_G3H with higher resistance? If not and short still exists, I'm assuming U1900 is the problem?\n\nI have a donor board coming for capacitors\/resistors\/etc, but it will be a week or so... china board with procs\/memory chips removed. I've already ordered a U1900 from here, should be here next week."}

I just toasted it to see if it would reflow or burn up crap underneath... but no go. Best reading is .02 ohms :-\/.\nSo besides eBay, which I'd rather avoid, where's a good place to locate a replacement logic board? I already tried eBay but got a board that had the random shutdown problem that a lot of the 820-3787 board have. Would you recommend sticking with the 820-3787 or something else that has a better track record?"}
