Only thing that obviously bad is the keyboard backlight is not working (lot of corrosion on both sides of connector but cleaned off well).  I am getting some memory errors when I do ASD (EFI mode), please see attached pics.  I've never seen this before, esp since old ones were removable.  I don't have the schematic for this one, would anyone be willing to share one with me, and do you guys think there is a connection between keyboard backlight and memory?  Are the memory problems going to be fatal or do you think I can give it back like this?"}

Add some flux and heat it to about 180C. I can add a diagram once the upload limit has been increased. Should be fixed tomorrow."}

The client picked up before I had time to try cleaning under any ram.  Haven't heard a complaint yet so I guess it working fine.  Thanks again"}
