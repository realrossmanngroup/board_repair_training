I injected 1v to those rails and found that <CAPACITOR>C7675</CAPACITOR> <TRANSISTOR>Q7660</TRANSISTOR> was damaged.\nBy removing these components <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> has a reading in diode mode of 0.456v but <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> is still under 0.042v (diode mode) and I inject 1v and I don't get significant consumption.\nI removed <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> just in case but I have the same problem"
