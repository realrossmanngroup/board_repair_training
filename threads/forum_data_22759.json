        "820-3462": "What is 820-3462? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U6990": "What is U6990? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "R6905": "What is R6905? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on older Macbooks, pre-2011 models. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

        "D6905": "What is D6905? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input on very old Macbooks(before 2011), can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",
        "R5280": "What is R5280? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",
        "R5281": "What is R5281? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",

Replaced them, got green light but n fan spin. A few minutes later <RESISTOR>R6920</RESISTOR> burnt out. Replaced it again and looked around for a short on the G3H lines but couldn't find anything.\n\nNow I get no green light but <RESISTOR>R6920</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> measure correct. But the voltage on <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> is somewhere around 0.7v and always moving. Diode mode on <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> is about 0.130.\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>     = 8.20 - 8.50.\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>   = 2.66 - moving\n\n\nEdit: Any idea why the battery interface was designed the way it was for this model? Seems overly complicated for almost zero benefit."
