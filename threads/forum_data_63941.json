The board is clean, with no signs of corrosion.\n\nThe power draw is steady at 5v 30mA. Although this is quite similar to Louis' TB Rom video I don't suspect that since the behaviour is steady on all four ports.\n\nPPDCIN_G3H = 5v\nPPBUS_G3H = 0v - not shorted\nPP3V3_G3H = 0v - not shorted\n\nD6902 is fine and providing 5V\nPM_EN_P3V3_G3H is missing.\n\nI need a bit of help on what to check next. Many thanks."}
