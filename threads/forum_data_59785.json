I tried smc reset but i just cant tun on machine after pressing shift,control,option and power button. So i bought new motherboard since i tought its motherboard issue but after attaching new motherboard problems didnt go away, its still the same. I can boot to system, fan is spinning but it seems the macbook is very slow. What could be a problem and how to solve it?"
