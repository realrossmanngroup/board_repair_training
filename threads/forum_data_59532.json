        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

        "C7050": "What is C7050? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for battery current sensing, you should measure around 2.202 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution.

Isl been replaced 3 times still same"
