        "message":"Got a board in that has no signs of physical or liquid damage. I get proper 12.58V on PPBUS. After plugged into the MagSafe the TPS IC U7501 gets extremely hot. I replaced the U7501 as well as the 2 MOSFETs and the shorts on the 3v3 rails was removed. However even after replacing those components after plugging the board into power again U7501 gets burning hot again. I have visually checked the capacitors on the rails and even removed the 3v3 coil to isolate the issue and am still at a loss."
