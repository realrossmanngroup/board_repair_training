I replaced the <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> as well as the 2 MOSFETs and the shorts on the 3v3 rails was removed. However even after replacing those components after plugging the board into power again <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> gets burning hot again. I have visually checked the capacitors on the rails and even removed the 3v3 coil to isolate the issue and am still at a loss."
