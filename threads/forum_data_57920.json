            "message": "i have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00875</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and fixed the backlight chip, because it had some damage around there and also tested Fuse, correct output on both sides, \nplugged it all in and it worked, put it all back together and when i type in the password to log in it starts to load and then the screen goes black, but it looks like the computer puts it self to sleep \nbecause the trackpad stops clicking as well, and i press the power button and it starts and starts loading again, i did look at the lcd sleep sensor on the board but there is no damage at all around there\n\nany ideas where to start :(\n\nthank you guys!"
