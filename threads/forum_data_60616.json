        "A1398": "What is A1398? A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",
        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "PP1V8_S0": "What is PP1V8_S0? PP1V8_S0 is a power rail that is present when the machine is in an S0 state, meaning it is fully turned on, not sleeping or hiberating .",

        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system.."
