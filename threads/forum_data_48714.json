        "message":"Hey guys, \n\nI need a opinion about this LCD! \n\nWhen i start the machine the LCD goes to wine color and slowly goes to normal color! After 4-5 minutes the backlight goes down!  \n\nanyone have the experience of open this LCD's and repair the backlight ?? Like the LCD's from Model A1312  ??\n\nI already repair 7-8 LCD's of model A1312, without to disassembly all LCD i can solder 7-8 cables and usually i can solve the problem of backlight! \n\nMy question is, it is possible to repair this model like A1312? I know one model have strips off leds other i think it s a lamp! \n\nAnyone have the experience to repair the LCD backlight off A1224 ?? Or only solve buying another one ? \n\nthanks"
