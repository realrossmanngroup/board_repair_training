Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q5800</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q5820</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q5840</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7500</CHIP>.\n\nShort is gone however <SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL> is only 1.4V now. Under thermal camera something around <TRANSISTOR>Q5800</TRANSISTOR> is getting hot however I have already replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q5800</TRANSISTOR> twice.\n\nWhat should be checked next?"
