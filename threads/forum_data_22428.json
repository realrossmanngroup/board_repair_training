Although the keyboard viewer shows every key responding, the fn key doesn't work/register so the fn keys don't do their functions and the keyboard viewer appears different, showing a full size extended keyboard instead of the smaller 11\".  Does anyone know which pin i should be looking at?"

This can only be done in AST.\nSo either get a trackpad that matches your current keyboard or get a keyboard that matches your trackpad. Or take it to Apple to have them configure the trackpad.\nFixing the old trackpad may be the easiest option here, I bet it is just a damaged connector."
