It powers on and runs great but the fan is running at full speed. i ran the onboard hardware test and id came back with some bull shit about there may be an issue with your s.m.c.\ncheck the pic. I did look around for liquid damage and didn't see anything of concern just minor residue on the board( nothing on any chips). \n\nnot really sure where to start on this one. any ideas?"

You'll need to look hard for corroded traces or components.\n\nI'm not sure, but is there an application which can interrogate the SMC sensors, including power readings ? A bit like OSX temp. You might want to use that to see if that picks up any anomalies.\n\nI can tell you this mac has had a fast fan issue reported as far back as early jan...so someone might have already had a go at cleaning stuff off already."

Sure enough found corrosion on the cable and connector cleaned it up and problem solved. \n\nwish some would would create a piece of software that could read the sensors on these newer boards. Mark problem as solved please\n\nthanks again guys."
