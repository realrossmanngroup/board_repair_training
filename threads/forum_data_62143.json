I contacted the supplier and they said that the A1706\/A1708\/A1989\/A2159\/A2251 all use the same trackpad and I can see online several listings that say this as well, but obviously my eyes are telling me another story. I held this one up to an A1706 trackpad I have in stock and it is the same size, so to me it seems that the A1706\/A1708\/A1989 are the same and at some point they changed the size. Just to arm myself with a little more knowledge and avoid getting another wrong part, which models of these newer generations have compatible trackpads with each other?"}
