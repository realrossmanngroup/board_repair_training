I contacted the supplier and they said that the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1989</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2159</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2251</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> all use the same trackpad and I can see online several listings that say this as well, but obviously my eyes are telling me another story. I held this one up to an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> trackpad I have in stock and it is the same size, so to me it seems that the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1989</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> are the same and at some point they changed the size. Just to arm myself with a little more knowledge and avoid getting another wrong part, which models of these newer generations have compatible trackpads with each other?"
