I have isolated  and tested the phase outputs of the drivers and I have 1.2V constant in phase 1 and 2.4V in phases 2 to 4. This without the presence of PWM signal in the driver inputs, since the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> is outputing constant  2,4V. The case is that according to the datasheet, if there is an OVC or OVP the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> sends the PWM signal to turn off the drivers (tristate PWM shutdown signal), which should be 2V (maybe it is 2.4V in practice?).\nNot sure where the problem is, PWM? Drivers? Others? Am I looking at the wrong place?\nI need advice. What should I do now?"
