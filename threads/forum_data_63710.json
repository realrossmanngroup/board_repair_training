It then display goes off and doesn\u2019t come back on. When display is off only 2 LED indicators on and no external display either. Sometimes it will come back on and reboot on its own , but usually it just stays off. It will with enough time boot up again with proper display. Display connectors and cables are perfect. I don't have another display or cables to test."}
