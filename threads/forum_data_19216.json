        "message":"Working on an 820-2610 that has me stumped. All S0 rails present when I power the board on except pp5v_s0, so no fan spin. PP5v_s0 is 0v. Diode mode gives me a dead short, .000v, and I've removed all components that show as PP5v_S0 on the board view but the short remains. Injected voltage and nothing else got warm, and I'm afraid it's a dead MCP.\n\nAny common things to check on this board? Replaced C7771 as a precautionary measure already. Not sure what else could be the case if I've removed all pp5v_s0 components. \n\nAny help appreciated!"
