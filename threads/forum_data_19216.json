            "message": "Working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2610</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that has me stumped. All S0 rails present when I power the board on except <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>, so no fan spin. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is 0v. Diode mode gives me a dead short, .000v, and I've removed all components that show as <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> on the board view but the short remains. Injected voltage and nothing else got warm, and I'm afraid it's a dead MCP.\n\nAny common things to check on this board? Replaced <CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR> as a precautionary measure already. Not sure what else could be the case if I've removed all <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> components. \n\nAny help appreciated!"
