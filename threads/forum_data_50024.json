        "message":"Hi,\nHas anyone got a board view and schematic for 820 00687. Water poured over laptop and now not switching on. Signs of liquid damage on board that I have attached to this image. The image with the highlighted caps I have found only have a resistance of 9ohm to ground and have found from injecting 1v voltage they have something to do with the processor. When I say this ,I have used freeze spray and it started to melt away from the processor, nothing else.\nThanks"
