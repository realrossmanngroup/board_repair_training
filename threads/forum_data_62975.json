            "message": "Macbook Pro 2020 Intel <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01987</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>\n\nHi! This Mac was filled with liquid and in the previous service it was cleaned of dirt. The Mac started to turn on, but after 5-7 seconds it turned off completely at the apple logo. I cleaned it up again. It had the J6801 trackpad connector torn off and I soldered it back on. After Revive in DFU, the computer began to enter the Recovery download window and asks to connect to a Wifi network (DFU via Air M1). If you enter the password for wifi, then the Mac will freeze tightly in a few seconds and will not react to anything. It may hang during the process of entering a password or choosing a network.\n\nIn the previous service it seems that <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> was soldered, but I did not notice anything suspicious anymore. There are no signs of corrosion on the board. Booting from an external drive does not work, it just hangs on the apple logo until a disk is selected. Tell me what should I do next? What should be measured? Consumption on the USB-C tester when the Mac freezes 673-680mA. Thanks!!!!\n\nWhen the Mac freezes when entering a password:\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 11.045v\n<SIGNAL>PP0V95_S0_CPUVCCIO_REG_R</SIGNAL> = 0.954v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_CPU_R</SIGNAL> = 0.806v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_CPU_PH1</SIGNAL> = 1.113v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_CPU_PH2</SIGNAL> = 1.116v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.302v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> = 5.114v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3S_WLANBT</SIGNAL> = 3.305v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S_WLANBT</SIGNAL>=1.802v"
