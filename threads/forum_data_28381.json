        "message":"About halfway through startup a horizontal narrow band of colours appears about an eighth of the way from the top of the screen and then it reboots. A workshop I use for iPhone board repairs helped diagnose it over the phone and after disabling AMD GPU and seeing it work on the slow Intel GPU, said this would need a GPU replacement so I paid them to do it as I don't have a BGA machine. However, it has made no difference whatsoever.\n\nThe lower RAM slot doesn't work. I have tried known good RAM chips in the upper slot as well as disconnecting everything but the bare minimum.\n\nAny suggestions on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated."
