What is the best way to go about it? \n\nShould I use a board heater, add solder to pins, and then use hot air? Should I put kapton tape on the plastic?\n\nShould I use a fine point soldering iron and tweezers to try to lift each corner of the connector individually? \n\nThank you for reading! I attached a photo of the connector for reference."}

Should I replace the resistors that I hit directly with hot air?"}
