This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

After close inspection under a microscope I could see there was a tiny amount of crap on F7000 chip. With the power plugged in the board is sitting at 1.33v and not turning on. Could you please tell me where I should go to from here? Just replace F7000?"
