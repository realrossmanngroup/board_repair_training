Does this over and over. \nOnce i go to test <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> the voltage starts to drop from about 11v and the MagSafe stops flashing, stays off. Same on <SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_ISOL</SIGNAL>. When measured at F6905, i get about 15v just before it starts to drop, but it keeps repeating. I pulled <TRANSISTOR>Q6910</TRANSISTOR> and confirmed <SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_CONN</SIGNAL> had 16V on it. Any ideas?"
