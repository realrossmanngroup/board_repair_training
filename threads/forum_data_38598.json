        "message":"Anyone experience this fail before, when the MagSafe is connected, it keeps flashing green and then goes off, then repeats. Does this over and over. \nOnce i go to test PPBUS_G3H the voltage starts to drop from about 11v and the MagSafe stops flashing, stays off. Same on PP18V5_DCIN_ISOL. When measured at F6905, i get about 15v just before it starts to drop, but it keeps repeating. I pulled Q6910 and confirmed PP18V5_DCIN_CONN had 16V on it. Any ideas?"
