Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",

After I replaced SMC it power with keyboard and battery plued 3 times and charges battery to 10% but now it power ONLY with ac adapter.  Could be bad soldering or bad SMC?"
