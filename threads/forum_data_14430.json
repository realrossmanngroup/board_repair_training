It works only with ac adapter.\nWith battery doesnot power anymore. I checked 3V on keyboard connector pin-5 and goes to 0V when press power. Also tried with new keyboard. After I replaced SMC it power with keyboard and battery plued 3 times and charges battery to 10% but now it power ONLY with ac adapter.  Could be bad soldering or bad SMC?"}

I heat SMC and I got green light and works only 1 hour. Then I replaced SMC and now works everything except to power the board with keyboard. I power the board with battery and then I plud the battery in hot and all is ok."}
