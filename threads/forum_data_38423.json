Missing tpad, keyboard, audio flex cable. Purchased aftermarket replacements and reassembled.\nNo life.\nTook apart and tested the board. Turns on with only charger but <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> is only 14.8V.\nAttached the display and got an Apple logo with progress bar then shuts off. Reassembled and unplugged one at a time to find the faulty component. Audio flex prevents from turning on at all. Tpad flex allows it to turn on but flashes backlight then off immediately. no tpad cable and it will load to Apple logo.\nThinking there’s liquid damage on the keyboard or tpad (no sensors tripped).\nBattery doesn’t appear to be picking up a charge - 5v to it when plugged in though.\n\nShould the machine be turning on with low V on <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>? Not finding a short. Assuming this is a bad <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> or <CHIP>U4700</CHIP> causing to be low?\nAny other reason to turn on and crash?"

No globe, plus the antenna connectors were ripped off. Replaced those then tried internet recovery just to be sure. “sudo diskutil cs delete “Macintosh HD”” tries to delete then fails with due to permissions. \n\nI noticed the core storage logical volume has about 4mb of free space and “diskutil list” shows 17 separate disk drives with about 15mb total. Compared to another <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1534</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> which has almost 19mb of free space in the logical volume and no extra disk drives. Thinking multiple apfs containers were created and now it doesn’t have enough free space to do anything. System doesn’t recognize as such though and can’t merge disks. \n\nWill try your suggestion."
