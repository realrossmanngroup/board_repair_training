The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely.

(I repaired the backlight by replacing the fuse). The board looks relatively clean but it has a few signs that may show someone else worked on it before. I think the issues might have been caused by the very cheap adapter the previous owner used as I don't see anything indicating water damage or spots that used to be water damaged. I notice a few spots with solder that may looks like it has been reflowed though (Not replaced).\n\nThe system works perfectly when running on battery power and if you connect the magsafe charger it will run off the charger, however it won't charge. If you plug the charger in without battery connected the system won't boot. However if you connect a battery the fans start spinning and they system will boot (But run of the charger). You can remove the battery from the motherboard once its running and it will work just fine.\nThe Charger always shows a green light\n\n--\n\nI already tested if power was being generated with only the charger in.\n\nThese are the rails:\n- <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: OK\n- <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL>: OK\n- <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_HS_GPU_ISNS</SIGNAL>: OK\n- <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL>: OK\n- <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>: OK\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>: OK\n- <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>: OK\n- <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>: OK\n(<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> is not there, however thats probably because its not in a S3 state)\n(<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is not there, however thats probably because its not in a S0 state)\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL>: OK\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>: OK\n(<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> is not there)\n(<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is not there, but it shows up with ~0.07V on it, can probably be ignored)\n\nI know it can take power from the charger and I know the rails are being created, however why doesn't it charge or want to boot up running Charger only? Is this possibility a BGA issue (Like the SMC not properly registering a charger) or am I just missing something?\n\nThanks in advance"

I replaced the DC inboard with a known working part and it now works without any issues."
