L6995 and U6990, pulled a wire to R6995 (Pin 1, PVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H) and the system booted again.\n\nEFI AHT gives passed, normal AHT gives passed. System works fine (Although maybe a bit slow? But that could be since I'm only used to HDDs. Its usable though) and keeps on working fine until you put it into sleep by either pressing sleep or closing the lid.\n\nGoing from S0 into S5 works fine, going into S3 seems to cause issues though. It says in S0 with the CPU getting hotter and hotter.\n\nWhere to even start looking? I never had an issue like this before\nCheers"}
