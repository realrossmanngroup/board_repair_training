        "message":"Hi guys,\n\nnice to be here again, need to update myself to latest development and there is no other place for that.\n\nI have a 820-00850 that switches to 20V only when the battery is connected. It will then draw 0.8-0.9A (possibly fully charged batt) and will give PPVCC_S0_CPU 1V. The fans spin and I get mouse light but no image internally, externally (if I disconnect the lvds) and no touchbar image.\n\nF9000 is at 12.59V.\nBoard is clean from liquids. Customer said one day was working next day not.\n\nAny pointers?"
