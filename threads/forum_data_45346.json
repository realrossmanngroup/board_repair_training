            "message": "Hi guys\n\nGot a 2015 MBP 820-000138-A board in. Had liquid damage (vinegarette!) to the LVDS area. Cleaned all the junk off, replaced all of the caps next to the LVDS as they were falling off (!) and replaced the LVDS connector itself.\n\nGetting no display on LCD (external display is fine) and no voltage at Pin 1 of the LVDS.\n\nStruggling a bit because there isn't a boardview for this model, the 'similar' one (I forget the board) doesn't have the same configuration around the LVDS area.\n\nOriginal LVDS cable had Pin 1 burnt out, have tried replacing the cable to the LCD and have also got a new LCD here to test with.\n\nNo display is showing behind the Apple logo with a torch, although I don't know if the Retina displays would show that?\n\nWhere best to start folks!?"
