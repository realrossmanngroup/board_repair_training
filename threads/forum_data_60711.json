If you don\u00b4t have PP3V3_S0 you should definitely check that first... maybe you have a short on that line.\n[\/QUOTE]\nIf this was a question for me, yes I made it work. I have soldered new U8030 which is TPS22924C load switch on PP3V3_S0. After that everything started to work fine. I have tested the laptop for about 2 hours when suddenly fan started running at full speed. It sems I had a bad luck and palm rest sensor faild. But Macs fan control applicatio in automatic mode on CPU senosor solved the fan noise. Laptop is worling without any delays and very responsive. The customer was happy to have his laptop fully functional again. So I consider this job done."
