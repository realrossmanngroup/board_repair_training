        "R5116": "What is R5116? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",

If you don´t have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> you should definitely check that first... maybe you have a short on that line.\n[/QUOTE]\nIf this was a question for me, yes I made it work. I have soldered new <CHIP>U8030</CHIP> which is TPS22924C load switch on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>. After that everything started to work fine. I have tested the laptop for about 2 hours when suddenly fan started running at full speed. It sems I had a bad luck and palm rest sensor faild. But Macs fan control applicatio in automatic mode on CPU senosor solved the fan noise. Laptop is worling without any delays and very responsive. The customer was happy to have his laptop fully functional again. So I consider this job done."
