If its messed up desolder it, put some solder on the pads and solder it back on again.\nYou said you already checked the bios traces and termination resistors so I assume that part of the circuit is alright. Make sure the traces that do no longer have their coating on them are not shorting to other traces though\n\nInspect the clock chip if it looks questionable or the solder joints aren't that great you can either touch them up or just replace the chip to be sure (Its just about $2).\n\nMaybe duke has some other tips as well"

I've replaced every single resistor next to the Bios chip but same behavior.\nIt quarter fan spins.\n\nDuke, do you believe it could be something other than the Bios area?\nI am getting .4A once I plug the charger which makes the quarter fan spin, then simple pulse on <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>.\nDoes it sound like a short on some random rails?\n\nAlso I am wondering what that <CHIP>U6101</CHIP> does?\nDo you know which values I should get on <SIGNAL>SPI_MLB_CS_L</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>SPIROM_USE_MLB</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SPI_MLBROM_CS_L</SIGNAL> when the system is pulsing please?"
