            "message": "Hi.\n\nBackground: LCD was not showing an image at all, an issue with the speaker, and also the battery was inflated. I ordered a new LCD original(just LCD) unglued the old one and tested it all the time with the new LCD. When powered on with or without battery it shows a picture, sometimes it goes to log in(with battery) and works for a bit and then turns off, and sometimes on loading, it will just restart. When it restarts sometimes it will show only the backlight, sometimes nothing. I found corroded CB 211 and removed it and also the row of <CAPACITOR>C3523</CAPACITOR> near <CHIP>U3500</CHIP>(resoldered all of them). I have replaced <CHIP>U9850</CHIP>(donor board), but still the same thing. I tried also a new battery just in case.  Note with the old LCD doesn't show a picture at all I tried it again after I tried with the new LCD. I noticed on the thermal camera it heats up around 55 degrees L7030 and <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>. Also, the chipset sometimes goes up to 55-56degrees. \n\nAny ideas would be appreciated"
