        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
        "R5280": "What is R5280? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",

They all have pins 3 at 0.000 after I disconnect power. I removed all three now and pins measure 1.550. Does this have any correlation? I should be normally getting voltage there, but <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> doesn't shoot anything out.\n\nEDIT: just put them back, pins 3 have around 0.620. After the power went through, they're sitting at 0.002 now.\nEDIT 2: just checked SPI Bus Series Termination again. Resistors measure good values.
