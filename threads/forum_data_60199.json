            "message": "On the table I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> from a 2017 13\" MBP. There was definitely some sort of spill in the back.no liquid on the LCD connector, just some sticky stuff on the  heat pipe for the CPU by the fan, and on the edge of the board by <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>. One USB port is showing 5v @ 5mA and the other shows 5V but the board restarts after 2 seconds in a loop. If I use the other port the board stays on steady at 5V. I checked <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> and it is there. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 0V but no shorts found. Is this one trash?"
