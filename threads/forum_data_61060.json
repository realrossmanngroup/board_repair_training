When you plug USB-C it gives 20v but on F7000 it gives only 1 Volt. If you use an external power supply and supply 12v on F7000 machines powers on fine. Also if you connect the battery and you supply 12v on F7000 it starts charging and powers on fine but it won't charge the battery.\n\nPP3V3_G3H present fine 3.3v\nD6905 : 1st Pin gets 1volt [ =PPBUS_G3H ], 2nd get 20v[ PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR ] and 3rd gets 19v [ PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H ]\nF7000 is not burnt and tested good. If you remove F7000 it pulsing between  1volt up to 2volt all the time\nU7000 has been replaced with new. \nI have tested all resistors around U7000 and they have their normal values\nR7020 gets 19v + Q7030 gets input 19v \n\ncould it be anything to do with SMC signals ?"}
