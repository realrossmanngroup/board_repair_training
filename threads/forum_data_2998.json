It's a MBA13 - 820-3437. I had 4 sensors failing: \"CPU Proximity\", \"Charger Proximity\", \"S2 Camera Proximity\" and \"Input Air Flow\". Machine running slow with full speed fan. I wasted time checking all these sensors just to find out everything looking normal. Then I tried making the sensor test without camera cable connected. And guess what... All sensor errors are gone! When I connect camera cable the 4 sensors fail again. So remember this next time you have weird sensor problems - disconnect camera before you go spending time on troubleshooting other sensors :eek: Also \"S2 Camera Proximity\" sensor stops failing when cable for the camera is unplugged :rolleyes:"}

If you measure with an oscilloscope on the pullup resistors for that data line with the bad webcam\/webcam cable plugged in you'll see it only goes up to 2.6v instead of 3.42v, check it."}

I checked and you're right. I just removed pin 8 and 9 from the ALS connector and now machine runs fine. Only light sensor capability missing but the customer doesn't care about that. Thanks again."}
