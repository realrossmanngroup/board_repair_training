The fans run high after a while (without running Heaven), with low temperatures in iStats. ASD doesn't work, not sure why: 1) EFI version claims I'm using the wrong version (3S150) 2) Internet version produces a '...cannot load EFI/Drivers/TestSupport.efi' error.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated."
