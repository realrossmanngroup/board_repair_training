It had oxidations on R5301\/02, R3880\/81 and failed SMC. Now it's back, I connect magsafe, the board turns on, LED turns green and turns off. Board remains on.\n\nI've already tested it with another DC.\n\nPPBus - 12.56v\n\nI checked the R7051\/52, R7021\/22. They are OK. On U7000, pins 17\/18 - 3.0ohm, 27\/28 - 20ohm\n\nAny suggestion?"}

The board is very complicated. I checked the continuity U7000 and U6901, it's ok.\n\nU6901, pins 1 and 2, floating between 1.3v and 0.7v, pin 5 - 3.42v, pin 4 - 0v.\n\ntesting, it stopped working overall. SMC_PM_G2_EN 0v. I changed the SMC, it worked again for two days. Now it has stopped again.\n\nSomething burning the SMC?"}
