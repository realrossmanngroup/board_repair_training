        "820-01521": "What is 820-01521? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP5V_G3S": "What is PP5V_G3S? PP5V_G3S is a 5v power rail present when the system is in a G3S standby state.",

        "PP3V3_G3H_RTC": "What is PP3V3_G3H_RTC? PP3V3_G3H_RTC Is one of the first rails that has to come on in order for the USB-C mux chip to be powered in the T2 chip Macbook Pros..",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V1_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V1_SLPS2R? The PP1V1_SLPS2R power rail in the MacBook schematic provides a 1.1-volt supply in a specific low-power state indicated by the \"_SLPS2R\" suffix and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP1V2_AWAKE": "What is PP1V2_AWAKE? The PP1V2_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides 1.2 volts and is associated with the machine's awake state and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP3V3_AWAKE": "What is PP3V3_AWAKE? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP0V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP0V8_SLPS2R? a SIGNAL.",
        "P5VG3S_EN": "What is P5VG3S_EN? This signal enables the PP5V_G3S power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

        "PP0V9_SSD": "What is PP0V9_SSD? PP0V9_SSD is a power rail that powers the soldered on NAND memory for the SSD on Macbooks with soldered on storage and must be present for the SSD to show up. .",
        "PP1V8_SSD": "What is PP1V8_SSD? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP2V7_NAND": "What is PP2V7_NAND? PP2V7_NAND is a power rail that powers the soldered on NAND memory for the SSD on Macbooks with soldered on storage and must be present for the SSD to show up. .",
        "SSD0_RESET_L": "What is SSD0_RESET_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
