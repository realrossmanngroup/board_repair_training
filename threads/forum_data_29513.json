        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

The funny thing is when I plug the charger and check voltage on the pins 5,6,7,8 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> the voltage is 12.6 v and its start to drop in 30sec to 1.4 V. And on <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> voltage is good on all pins. I've checked <RESISTOR>R7085</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7086</RESISTOR> and they are reading fine. Also checked <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR> they are all good. Also replaced the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> but no luck. Any ideas what pulls the voltage down from <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR>? I've also replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> but no luck"

I was removing and replacing the <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> after I replace them I've noticed that the voltage is ok but slowly goes down, and I start thinking why the voltage is goin down. And it click in my head because the board is cooling down from the heatgun and I started heating up the area again and voltage was going up so I started replacing the caps and I found out that the <CAPACITOR>C7030</CAPACITOR> is bad. HOWEVER I still hear that clicking and pinching kinda frequency sound from some component and the board is still not powering"
