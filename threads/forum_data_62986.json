A graphic load software won't start on the external screen. \nThought it could be a <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> cold joint issue and resoldered it, in the process resoldered <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> as well. Afterwards, the board won't even turn on and would stay at 0.28A with and without a battery. \n\nFound short on <TRANSISTOR>Q7510</TRANSISTOR>. Not sure if the heat somehow triggered it, went and replaced it. Now it tries to turn on and switches off with a battery, keeps repeating it -  0A - 0.44A - 0A\n\nMeasured that \n<SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> - jumps 0 - 3.3V and repeats, together with P3V3/<SIGNAL>P5V_S5_EN</SIGNAL> signals.\n\nWent through the board to hunt for shorts but couldn't locate any. \n<SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> is SMC output line, how I can check if losing voltage before?\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.4V"

Resoldering pads resolved the problem in that case. Thought this could be the same as it wasn't showing internal video, but external seemed to be working.\n\nAgree.
