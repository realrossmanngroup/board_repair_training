This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger.",

But the resistor 10 ohm, still exploded after putting a new one... So strange. what could cause that to happen.. ? The trace is inside the board to the other side.. wont be possible to cut off the trace, unless u have a great idea how to? \n\nI could add jumpers from that cap to the other points its should connect to and see what happens. What do u suggest?"
