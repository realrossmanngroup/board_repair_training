How do I go about to solve that issue? drill a hole in the board through it?\n\n\n\n(pp3v42.. forget that, i was just mumbling.)"}

But the resistor 10 ohm, still exploded after putting a new one... So strange. what could cause that to happen.. ? The trace is inside the board to the other side.. wont be possible to cut off the trace, unless u have a great idea how to? \n\nI could add jumpers from that cap to the other points its should connect to and see what happens. What do u suggest?"}
