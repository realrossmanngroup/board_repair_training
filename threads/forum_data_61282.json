However if you unplug the charger and plug it back in, it can take up to 45 seconds for it to come back on. Measuring <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> when this occurs it hangs around .3-.4V for a while before going to 16V. \n\nSwapped known good DCIN board/flex. Also have changed SMC, <CHIP>U5010</CHIP> and ultimately J4700 in efforts to get the charger light to come on (J4700 was the problem with charger light) This problem existed prior to changing those and after. Also tried changing <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> and components around it, <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>...\n\nIt seems like something isn't resetting to allow the board to restart?"
