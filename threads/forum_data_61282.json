        "message":"Logic and DCIN flex are out of the Mac on bench. THis board starts and boots upon initial attachment of proper magsafe charger. However if you unplug the charger and plug it back in, it can take up to 45 seconds for it to come back on. Measuring PPDCIN_G3H when this occurs it hangs around .3-.4V for a while before going to 16V. \n\nSwapped known good DCIN board\/flex. Also have changed SMC, U5010 and ultimately J4700 in efforts to get the charger light to come on (J4700 was the problem with charger light) This problem existed prior to changing those and after. Also tried changing U6990 and components around it, U7000...\n\nIt seems like something isn't resetting to allow the board to restart?"
