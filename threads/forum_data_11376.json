Initially it had no light on the charger and no ppbus_g3h. I have put flux and heated all the areas with liquid damage.\n PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS was shorted to ground and the caps on that line were burned on the end so I replaced all of them. The short is gone on there and it now shows 12.58v on it.\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.58v\nPPVRTC_G3H - 3.45v\nPP5v_S5 and PP3v3_S5 both show 0v and there is no short to ground on them.\n\nI have replaced many components that looked bad and they were connected to the 3v3 and 5v rails.\nHere are a list of some components I replaced:\nQ7820 and the caps\/resistors next to it\nU2660, C2600, C2660\nC7943 and R1923\nR3380\n\nU7200(TPS51125) looks spotless with no liquid damage.\n\nI haven't UC'd the board yet so I can save a cleaning."}

I can see a little spark at the trace that is to the right of R5410. The trace is now exposed a little from being burned.\n\nIn diode mode I measured PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS with R5410 on the board and it shows 0.10v. I'm not 100% sure but I believe that number was around 0.35v with R5410 not on the board."}
