        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",

        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. ALL_SYS_PWRGD, PM_RSMRST_L, PM_SLP_SUS_L, and PM_SLP_S3_L are necessary prerequisites for CPU_VR_EN to be present. .",

Reinstalled fine, made user, and it shuts down when about to show desktop.  Worked fine in Safe Boot.  Weird.  Ended up buying mac from customer so she could get a new one and get back to work, and I can get a working LCD for another customer.\n\nANYWAY.  Finally got around to inspecting board, found water damage at <RESISTOR>R7222</RESISTOR> -> <RESISTOR>R7225</RESISTOR> (nostuff) replaced them all, checked continuity, found more damage, missing pad/trace from <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> pin 22 to <CHIP>U7320</CHIP>, ran bodge after pulling chip and reworking. Was some damage under pin 22 but haven't replaced <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> yet since EN is missing. Should I?\n\nNow the thing doesn't power on and I hate everything :)  No good signals at <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> but I do have 5VS5/3.42V/12.6V.\n\nNo <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> because it's 2020"

I killed it hard core didn't I? I knew to not put anything there; I know what nostuff means, but it's sure as shit soldered right there on my board.  A 0 ohm of course.\n\nMy brain went into monkey see monkey do mode maybe?! So yea, I super legit put a 0 ohm there. Good catch.  Massively good catch.  I'm impressed beyond anything, ever. Wow.\n\nThanks 2.  Did I kill it?  A lovely 3.1/16GB, 4924?\n\nEdit:  I can't check 3.<SIGNAL>3_S5</SIGNAL> at this exact moment, but I do have a 32k clock which i think gets power from 3.3s5?  I can check in morning."
