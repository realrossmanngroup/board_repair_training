This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",

Board was cleaned in the Crest ultrasonic. \nEverything on the board works, in fact the battery will charge, and it will run off the battery, but the battery is not being detected. \nI have tried a different top case with a known good battery and a different interposer board. Same issue remains. \n\nCan you guys help me troubleshoot this? \nThanks!"
