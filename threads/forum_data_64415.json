        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance â€“ this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",
