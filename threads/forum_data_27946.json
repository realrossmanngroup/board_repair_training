I connected the board using a benchtop power supply to force 18.5 volts and although i get the voltage set, amps are very low 0.0057 and still no voltage regulation. Ive replaced components which were not giving me a proper resistance or ohm readout on the 1 wire circuit but no luck."

I did further investigating and found that when i provided the board with 18.5 volts everything around the <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> voltage regulator chip was shorting to ground. When i raise the voltage even further the chip would get extremely hot. Is it normal for everything to short around that chip? I went ahead and removed it and short dissapeared on all components around it. Bad chip?"
