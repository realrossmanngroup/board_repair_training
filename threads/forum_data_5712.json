After so troubleshooting i found that <SIGNAL>LCD_IG_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is missing on pin 1 of the <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> chip. This single comes from the PCH. Am i correct in assuming that i have a dead PCH and this board should head to the bin or am i missing something? Also this board does turn on and chime. Thanks"
