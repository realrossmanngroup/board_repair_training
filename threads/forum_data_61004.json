This board has clear signs of previous work on Q9706, U8900 and U5550. There was flux all around U8900 and U5550 and after I cleaned it off I could see the poor soldering job that was left. I re-soldered both chips but that didn't change anything. PPVCORE_GPU is .7V and 10.3 Ohms to gnd. I have a working version of this board for comparison and the working board is 34 ohms to gnd. \n\nLCD_PWR_EN: 0V\nPP5VR3V3_SW_LCD: 0V"}
