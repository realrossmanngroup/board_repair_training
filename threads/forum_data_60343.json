        "message":"Hi guys.\n\nTricky one... I have a 12\" board that appear is in S0 state but won't turn on. CPU gets HOT. Every rail and signal seems to be present...\n\nI suspect it was zapped by a USB-C hub\/dongle (Genuine charger but Unitek hub). Was working fine yesterday and today its dead. USB-C port on the hub smells burnt (but no visible burn), charger is still fine.\n\n- PPVCC_S0_CPU = 1.7V\n- PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK = 3.28\n- PCH_CLK32K_PMIC is good\n- PLT_RESET_L = 3.28V\n\nNot sure where to go from here?\n\nCheers,\n\nMick"
