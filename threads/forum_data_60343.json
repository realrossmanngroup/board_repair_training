Every rail and signal seems to be present...\n\nI suspect it was zapped by a USB-C hub/dongle (Genuine charger but Unitek hub). Was working fine yesterday and today its dead. USB-C port on the hub smells burnt (but no visible burn), charger is still fine.\n\n- <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> = 1.7V\n- <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL> = 3.28\n- <SIGNAL>PCH_CLK32K_PMIC</SIGNAL> is good\n- <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> = 3.28V\n\nNot sure where to go from here?\n\nCheers,\n\nMick"
