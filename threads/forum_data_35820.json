It will break many things including webcam, LAN, etc. Just editing the serial number will give an error when you run a hardware test as the checksum on the Fsys block is no longer correct.\nExplaining how this all works is way too complicated for the few times you may need this. The easy solution is to buy a \"Medusa\" from Chipmunk so you can mess around with it yourself. They are not cheap though! It will however fix the ME, correct Fsys checksum and remove EFI lock, etc.\n\n[url]http:\/\/www.cmizapper.com[\/url]"}
