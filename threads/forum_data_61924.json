After inspection I found corrosion around <CAPACITOR>C2952</CAPACITOR> area. Cleaned everything and replaced all caps that looked bad and also <CHIP>U8000</CHIP> that was shorted to GND. Now board gets steady 8.56V on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and tries to enter S0. All S0 coils pulse including L7310/20 but after that it goes to 0V again and nothing else. Already inspected whole board for other corrosion points but could not find anything. Where should I look now?"
