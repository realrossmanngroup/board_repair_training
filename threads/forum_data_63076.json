            "message": "Hi all,\n\nI have no idea were to start with this MLB. The issue is, the MacBook will boot to OS and show internal display and external only with external monitor connected. Once the external monitor is unplugged the internal LCD goes out. Basically the MacBook can be used normally if an external display is plugged in all the time. I already installed the Logic Board into a known perfect working chassis/lcd assembly and the same issue persists. The Logic Board has an issue and I do not know where to start. I check to see if any components are missing and all is perfect. This Logic Board is in mint condition with no physical damage. \n\nI made a video so ya'll can see the issue. \n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vt5_zt7Hdm72futB6CI4l3gsw1tqWk3p/view?usp=sharing[/URL]\n\nAny idea's???"

            "message": "This MacBook came from another shop. They said it was showing black screen but when plug in external that the internal video shows. The internal video only shows in OS if you start the machine with the external monitor already plugged in. Once the external is unplugged the internal video goes out, if you try to plug the external back in the video won't switch to either internal or external. The machine needs to start with the external already plugged in to get any video in the OS. If start machine without external the internal video only works in boot menu/ during apple logo then goes out when reaches OS. They tried a good working LCD assembly & same issue. I also confirmed with my own chassis/ LCD assembly and the problem is the same. \n  \n<RESISTOR>R9850</RESISTOR>/51 = 4.6k\n<RESISTOR>R9819</RESISTOR> = 2.2k\n<CHIP>U9850</CHIP> replaced & issues persist, same exact symptom. \n\nAt startup/boot menu video shows fine (without external connected)\n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_IG_HPD_R</SIGNAL> = 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_IG_HPD</SIGNAL> = 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_EG_HPD_R</SIGNAL> = 2.9v\n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_EG_HPD</SIGNAL> = 2.5v\n\nWhen boot show apple logo on internal then when go into OS internal video goes black (without external connected)\n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_IG_HPD_R</SIGNAL> = 3.0v\n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_IG_HPD</SIGNAL> = 2.8v\n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_EG_HPD_R</SIGNAL> = 0v\n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_EG_HPD</SIGNAL> = 0v\n\nMaybe issue with <CHIP>U1200</CHIP>?
