I've tried other RAM memories too and found small oxidations on the contacts of the memory slots, I cleaned them but nothing changed.\nI noticed that after testing with a good BIOS, the mac did not recognize the RAM memories at times, displaying an individual beep, as if there were no memories installed. I tested good memories individually in each slot, but the beeps are intermittent. With or without beeps, PPVCORE_S0_CPU is still locked at 1.1V\n Do you have any suggestions? Thanks!"}
