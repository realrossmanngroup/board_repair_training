        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "R7151": "What is R7151? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "R7152": "What is R7152? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "C7150": "What is C7150? a CAPACITOR.",
        "R7120": "What is R7120? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. ."

Replace the isl and green light appear!\nNow i have 3.7V o PPBUS! Already replace 2 times the ISL for a new one! and i need to replace <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR>. \ni have 4.9ohm on <CAPACITOR>C7150</CAPACITOR> and 22.8ohm on <CAPACITOR>C7150</CAPACITOR>. \n\nI don't want to touch in other components without certainties! \n\nany advice are welcome! \n\nthanks"
