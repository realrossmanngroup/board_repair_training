Using my DC power suplply i noticed the U7100 a little hot. Replace the isl and green light appear!\nNow i have 3.7V o PPBUS! Already replace 2 times the ISL for a new one! and i need to replace R7151 and R7152. \ni have 4.9ohm on c7150 and 22.8ohm on c7150. \n\nI don't want to touch in other components without certainties! \n\nany advice are welcome! \n\nthanks"}
