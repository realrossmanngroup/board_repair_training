    "definitions": {
        "820-01041": "What is 820-01041? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8400": "What is U8400? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_S0SW_LCD": "What is PP3V3_S0SW_LCD? PP3V3_S0SW_LCD is a 3.3v power rail necessary to power the image circuitry on the screen. This is necessary to get a picture on the screen. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCD_BKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCD_BKLT? a SIGNAL.",
        "IPD_LID_OEPN": "What is IPD_LID_OEPN? a SIGNAL.",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created..",
        "R8442": "What is R8442? a RESISTOR.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "I2C_BKLT": "What is I2C_BKLT? I2C_BKLT is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_R": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "R8450": "What is R8450? a RESISTOR.",
        "R8452": "What is R8452? a RESISTOR.",
        "R8453": "What is R8453? a RESISTOR.",
        "R8451": "What is R8451? a RESISTOR.",
        "C8553": "What is C8553? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C8554": "What is C8554? a CAPACITOR.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix."
