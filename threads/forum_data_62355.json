When charging was connected, it made a sound of connecting the charger. If you press the on/off button for a long time, and then on, then the cooler started spinning for a second and that's it\nConsumption with a connected battery is slightly more than 2A\nConsumption with disconnected battery is between 150mA and 300mA\n\n<SIGNAL>EDP_AUXCH_N</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>EDP_AUX_P</SIGNAL> resistance kOhms\nThere is no picture on the external display\nLogged into DFU and using Apple Configurator 2 restored T2\nThe result did not work, I disassembled the laptop\n\nThe <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> was warming up, it was removed, after that an understated resistance was detected by <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL>, and that's where it started\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> ground resistance at the time of detection is 120 ohms, nevertheless 5v is present and nothing but the PROCESSOR is heated (approximately 40 degrees)\n\nThe next day, the resistance of <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> to the ground was 21 ohm\nAll capacitors were removed (according to BoardView), which according to <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> were on the ground - the resistance remained 21 ohm\nRemoved all resistors, which goes <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> also on BoardView\n\n<RESISTOR>R7100</RESISTOR> removed, <SIGNAL>PP5V_COREVR_VCC</SIGNAL> - kilooms, <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S_CPUREG_MISC</SIGNAL> - 21 ohm\n<RESISTOR>R7215</RESISTOR> removed, <SIGNAL>PP5V_MAIN_VCORE1</SIGNAL> - kilooms\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL>-ALSCAM - 21 ohm\n\nRemoved <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>, <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> - resistance has not increased, still 21 ohm\n\nA voltage of 1 volt was applied to <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL>, consumption was 100mA, increased to 2.5 volts, consumption began to grow to 400mA, nothing was heated, 3 volts, consumption 700mA, <TRANSISTOR>Q7660</TRANSISTOR> began to warm, was removed, nothing changed, L7670 was removed, <SIGNAL>P5VG3S_VSW</SIGNAL> - kOhm\nBut after connecting the LBP, the resistance of <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> jumps to the ground between 180-230 ohm\n\nSubsequent connection of the LBP to <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> does not give results, at 3-4 volts, consumption of 10mA\n\nI don't know which way to dig anymore and what kind of floating resistance is this\nI would be very grateful for any help"
