I mean literals just say good bye and never start up again. Except annoying beep  \n\nI opened it there was some funny paper on the RAM but well it doesn't charge battery from start. So I decide first work on it and change isl625 now I am stuck with this RAM problem. On L7330 is 0.22 V\nI changed already u7300 twice and still same issue. I was thinking to change  Q7330 as a start point but that mos look OK. Any advice where to start?"}

Its a stupid question but I rather ask and be stupid a minute that stay stupid :D"}
