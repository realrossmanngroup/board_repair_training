System chimes as normal but there is nothing on the internal screen. \n\nVisual inspection revealed some liquid damage on the JTAG connector which has been cleaned up, i've also cleaned the screen connection and tried another LCD - still no display. I'm not getting any voltage on L8300 so i'm guessing it might be a <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> issue but i cannot see any liquid around <CHIP>U8300</CHIP>? Is there anything else I need to check before replacing <CHIP>U8300</CHIP>?"
