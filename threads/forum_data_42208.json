        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",

One port recieves 5V 0,15V. \n\nIs that cd3215C00 issue? I must change only one CD or all 4 ?\n\nThanks"
