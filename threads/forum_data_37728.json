        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

I also noticed that the sleep light is on all the time (<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.4V) and that it wont chime (also no chime after NVRAM Reset). Next thing i noticed is that it also wont beep without ram installed. I checked <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> and it is 1.14V. I also tried to heat the GPU gently to ~100 °C-150 °C as this one is late 2011 but still on change. So i am stuck here."

So chances are good that somebody messed with the bios already and may have causet this problems.... Also GPU looks like it has seen more than one Heatgun (as everyone of this 2011 ones...). But if this turns on i will deaktivate it anyways so i would give it a try. Could you please send me a \"clean bios file\" for this one (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B) as you did for me with some other boards in the past?\nUnfortunately i have only <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A donors here at the moment..."
