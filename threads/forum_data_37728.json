        "message":"This 820-2915 turns on but has no image. Also nothing on an external display. I also noticed that the sleep light is on all the time (SMC_LID is 3.4V) and that it wont chime (also no chime after NVRAM Reset). Next thing i noticed is that it also wont beep without ram installed. I checked CPU_VCORE and it is 1.14V. I also tried to heat the GPU gently to ~100 \u00b0C-150 \u00b0C as this one is late 2011 but still on change. So i am stuck here."

        "message":"Ok. Thank you for the answer. I looked closly to the Bios IC and it (again) looks like i am not the first one here. I can see a little bit of flux under it. So chances are good that somebody messed with the bios already and may have causet this problems.... Also GPU looks like it has seen more than one Heatgun (as everyone of this 2011 ones...). But if this turns on i will deaktivate it anyways so i would give it a try. Could you please send me a \"clean bios file\" for this one (820-2915-B) as you did for me with some other boards in the past?\nUnfortunately i have only 820-2915-A donors here at the moment..."
