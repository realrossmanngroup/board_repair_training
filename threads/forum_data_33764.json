        "message":"Hi, \nI've got a 2012 a1286 here. Fans going full speed and clock speed is low, but EFI ASD doesn't find any errors. \n\nKnown history:\n1) BIOS was corrupted --> reflashed\n2) Accidentally bridged C8900 and C8901 during reflow of U8900 putting 12V (PPVIN_S0_GFXIMVP) on the 5V rail (PP5V_S0_GFXIMVP_VDD). Big whoops.\n2a) Replaced U8900\n2b) Replaced U7300\n\nFor now anything that uses 5V is suspect to me. Any way to narrow this down?\n\nThanks!\n\nRick"

I know some of these are faulty, but I don't have any alternatives at the moment. Come to think of it, the fan issue appeared after the BIOS flash. Any ideas where to get a proper BIOS for this model?"

(mine is 8.0.4.1441, but only v8.1.70.1590 is available on the winraid forum)\n2) Is removing the first $SVS block necessary when there's no lock on the machine the dump was pulled from?\n\nThanks again people :)"
