All voltages cycle up to normal. U1950 is good. Board was barely hit by liquid. I attached pre-cleaning pics. Not much there at all. No shorts that I have found. Vcore is at 14\u03a9 to ground. Checked all SPI resistors and traces. Not sure where to look next."

I was concerned U5823 might have been hit but it looks good and the voltages are measuring normally also. All the voltages cycle every 3 seconds or so and it's just an up and then right back down thing, so maybe 1 second at most."
