After cleaning up that area every worked great until recently.  It did have a bad U7800 when it came back a second time. U7800 was causing all the slp, wake, g3h to jump, and caused pp5v_g3s and p3v3man_pgood to being missing all together. After changing it I get the voltages below now. It is stuck at 20v 0.03A. I have tried a revive and restore in DFU mode but both give an error of code 9.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.63V\nPP3v3_G3H = 3.29V\nPP1V8_SLPS2R = 1.8V\nPP1V8_AWAKE = 1.8V\nPP1V1_SLPS2R = 1.1V\nPP0V8_SLPS2R = 0.79V\nPP3V3_AWAKE = 3.29V\nPP1V2_AWAKE = 1.19V\nPMU_PVDDMAIN_EN = 3.3V\nP3V3MAIN_PGOOD = 3.26V\nPP3V_G3H_RTC = 3.0V\nPCH_RTC_RESET_L = 3.0V\nP5VG3S_EN = 1.8 V\nPP5V_G3S = 5.109V\nPP2V5_NAND_SSD0 = 2.5V\nPP0V9_SSD0 = .9V\nPPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0 = 1.8V\n\nAny suggestions?
