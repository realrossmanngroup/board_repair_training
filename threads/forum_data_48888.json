        "message":"Have a 820-3115 with a strange issue of not powering up from apple a\/c adapter but powers up fine each time with programmable power supply.\n\nOriginal problem was F4260 was blown from minor liquid damage on dc jack, replaced both and boots fine each time on programmable power supply but green light just blinks with no fan spin when using a normal charger.\n\nWhat could cause this?? I have tried multiple dc jacks as well."
