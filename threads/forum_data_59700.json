        "820-00426A": "What is 820-00426A? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "A1398": "What is A1398? A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "U8300": "What is U8300? a CHIP.",
        "BKL_SW": "What is BKL_SW? BKL_SW means “BACKLIGHT SWITCH” – DC to DC boost circuits increase voltage by putting a lower voltage, like 8 volts, through an inductor. On the other side of the inductor, it is switched to ground rapidly - on this side, you will end up with an increased voltage as a result of the switching. BKL_SW usually refers to the pin on the LED driver that is attached to the inductor. .",
        "BKL_FET_CRTL_R": "What is BKL_FET_CRTL_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q7701": "What is Q7701? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

        "R7742": "What is R7742? a RESISTOR."
