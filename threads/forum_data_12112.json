        "message":"[PLAIN][SOLVED]MacBook Pro 13.3\" - Early 2011 both USB ports dead \/ not working - no liquid damage[\/PLAIN]\n\nWorking on a MacBook Pro 13.3\" - Early 2011 logic board that has both USB ports dead.  \n\nEverything else seems to work properly and it's otherwise a very normal A1278.  Inspection under a scope shows absolutely no signs of liquid damage, obvious burns on the board or probe points.\n\nOn both USB ports I get a good 5v on pin 1.  Pin 3 on both USB ports are idle until something is plugged in then they switche to 3v.  \n\nAlso.... I have the schematic for this model but not a \"location\" guide showing the placement of the various chips.  Any help would be appreciated."
