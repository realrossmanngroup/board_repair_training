            "message": "Hey!\nI have an iMac that \"seems\" to be in good working condition once booted, but has these weird issues.\n\n- When I plug in power, fans go high indefinitely until I press the power button then it chimes and boots into O.S. like normal. Then when I shut down from O.S., it seems like it shuts down but it never does. The screen goes black and fans run high again until I press power button, then it boots all over again. I cant even hold the power button to cut power.\n- When I try to run ASD it gets stuck after initial POST test. Keyboard and mouse will not work when this happens.\n- Fans go high when it goes to sleep.\n\nHistory - Came in with no video. Someone put a fuse in place of L9100. Other than that, it looks fine.\n\nThanks. Have a good one."
