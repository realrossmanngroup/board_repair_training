            "message": "The 9051 cards were made with a VBIOS for LVDS screens (2009 21\" only) and eDP screens (2010+) If the card has the old LVDS VBIOS then there will be no image on internal LCD, external should work. But as you tested it in a 2011 and the customer machine is a 2010 it should just work. They probably fucked up the LCD connector as usual."
