Board was liquid damaged and had no backlight, no battery charge, wouldn't run on battery etc.\n\nFixed everything except this last issue. Checking <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>, PP0V675, <SIGNAL>PP1V8_CAM</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V35_CAM</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP1V2_CAM</SIGNAL> are all present during boot but as soon as it gets to the login screen, all voltages disappear.\n\nAm I right in thinking the <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> is faulty? I've replaced the iSight camera cable and all sensors work.\n\nThanks!"

SMC is a larger chip, with larger balls, and has ~157 balls. <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> is smaller chip and has ~208 balls...very, very small and very easy for them to \"run\". It's also \"CRITICAL\", so you fuck it up and you now have a non-working board. Just not worth the risk/hassle/pain for a no-cam issue, really. People HAVE done it--I've done 1 of them, and I had to re-ball the chip twice before I even got it on the board. It just wasn't worth it. Took like 3-4 hours, and it was not fun. The time you spend repairing it will cost you more than the loss you'll incur with a no-cam, but working, board."
