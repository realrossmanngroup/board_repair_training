    "definitions": {
        "820-3435": "What is 820-3435? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PP3V3_S5_REG": "What is PP3V3_S5_REG? PP3V3_S5_REG is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H_REG": "What is PP3V42_G3H_REG? PP3V42_G3H_REG is another way to say PP3V42_G3H. PP3V42_G3H_REG and PP3V42_G3H are a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing."
