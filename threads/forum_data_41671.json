Thanks in advance for all the info shared in this forum and in the Youtube Channel Louis and all. Thanks to discovering this forum I'm thinking about repairing my MBP17\" E2009 instead of letting it go.\n\nLet me explain the problem as much as possible to help other people identify similar issues.\n\n[B]MBP SPECS:[\/B]\n[LIST]\n[*]Macbook Pro 17\", Early 2009 unit, A1297. MacBookPro 5,2\n[*]Core 2 Duo 2.66GHz\n[*]8 GB RAM (2x4 GB CSX DDR3 1066MHz)\n[*]Crucial SSD MX200 512GB\n[*]SMC version: 1.42f4\n[*]Logic Board version: 820-2390-A\n[*]Battery is an Apple official replacement one (Apple A1309, 7.3V, 95Wh) that still retains 71% capacity. No battery defects detected by \"Battery Monitor\" app. Original battery had to be replaced due to cell expansion disturbing the touchpad.\n[*]AC charger is an Apple original one, 85W.\n[*]MOJAVE 10.14 macOS fully working (thanks to dosdude1.com instructions).\n[*]Apps I'm using to locate the problem: HW Monitor, Macs Fan Control.\n[\/LIST][INDENT]NOTES: same problem happened with macOS 10.11 El Capitan, and also with other A1309 compatible batteries (ANSANOR and other brands, I've tried 3 different ones).[\/INDENT] \n[B]THE PROBLEM:[\/B]\n\nShort description:\n\nThe MBP shuts down randomly, specially when working only with battery, but sometimes (less usual) with the AC charger also shuts down or even without battery (only AC charger).\n\nDetails:\n[LIST]\n[*]When it shuts down, I have to press at least twice the Power button to get re-started. First time is a faulty start almost always (front LED turns on of 1-2 seconds and shuts down again).\n[*]Sometimes it does not even arrive to do a full re-start, shuts down during the start up process. Less frequent when powered by AC charger.\n[*]When running on battery only it's way way more complicated to turn it on, almost always fails. Measuring Battery voltage during turn on (without AC charger), it's at 8.3V before Power on, and goes down to 7.7V during turn on process, so it does not seem to go so low (nominal is 7.3V). Measuring the CPU voltage does not get lower than 0.98V on the DMM.\n[*]When running with the AC charger, if it gets disconnected and remains powered only by the battery, usually shuts down. Time can vary from a couple of seconds up to a few minutes, usually remains more time ON when the CPU is not working hard.\n[*]When running without battery, same problem happens, maybe it takes a little bit more time, but ends happening too.\n[*]CPU Core Voltages (as per HW Monitor app) vary from 0.780V up to 1.1V (never stays at one voltage level fixed), confirmed by measuring on C1250-C1253 with a DMM.\n[B]8V back and forth in les than 1 second, is this normal? This voltage fluctuates pretty fast (can go back and forth from 0.78V to 0,9 in less than one second periods).[\/B]\n[*]CPU temperature arrives at 90\u00baC (celsius) when reproducing youtube HD videos or other demanding apps. I have Macs Fan Control set to start on CPU1 at 65\u00baC and max temperature at 80\u00baC, so they use to be blowing at almost 5000rpm usually.\n[*]I've reseted the SMC, NVRAM, etc...\n[*]Fans are clean of dust.\n[*]Never did a thermal paste renewal.\n[\/LIST] \u00bfAny ideas? \u00bfCan it be the infamous C7771?\n\nThanks in advance!! I hope this can help other people with similar problems ;)"}

I've been trying to find the BRD file (I have the SCH) to look for those components, but I'm not able to find it. I guess those components are on the CPU side (C7771 for sure isn't it?), so the Logic Board needs to be extracted. Will take it out tomorrow morning. If anyone can share the BRD file of this board, thanks in advance! ;)"}

Did also the thermal paste job. Everything with care and discharging static... but now after reinstalling all in the chassis, it does not turns ON (not even once) and the board temperature rises noticeable (does not rise too much but noticeable) on the uP and central NVIDIA (U1400) zones.\n\nTried reseting the SMC and turn it ON with the SMD jumpers (R5001 & R5015) but no luck. The front white led does not make any light, the fans doesn't move, and the LCD does not show anything. Both powering from battery alone, AC alone, or both.\n\nIf I check the battery status with the lateral button it shows 100% charge, if I disconnect the battery the LEDs blink one after another.\n\nVoltages I'm reading are:\n\nC7030: 16.04V\nF4020: 9.985V (fluctuates between 9.983V-9.990V)\nR7790: 8.4V\nC7650: 8.4V\nR5015: 3.396V\nR5001: 2.960V\nU7840 (pin 6): 3.4V\nR2120: 3.4V\nC3101: 1.5V\nFans (pin 1): 5V\nC8000: 1.112V\n\nWill keep looking at voltages all around the PCB, but I don't have good feeling... any idea?"}
