Thanks to discovering this forum I'm thinking about repairing my MBP17\" E2009 instead of letting it go.\n\nLet me explain the problem as much as possible to help other people identify similar issues.\n\n[B]MBP SPECS:[/B]\n[LIST]\n[*]Macbook Pro 17\", Early 2009 unit, <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1297</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. MacBookPro 5,2\n[*]Core 2 Duo 2.66GHz\n[*]8 GB RAM (2x4 GB CSX DDR3 1066MHz)\n[*]Crucial SSD MX200 512GB\n[*]SMC version: 1.42f4\n[*]Logic Board version: <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2390</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A\n[*]Battery is an Apple official replacement one (Apple A1309, 7.3V, 95Wh) that still retains 71% capacity. No battery defects detected by \"Battery Monitor\" app. Original battery had to be replaced due to cell expansion disturbing the touchpad.\n[*]AC charger is an Apple original one, 85W.\n[*]MOJAVE 10.14 macOS fully working (thanks to dosdude1.com instructions).\n[*]Apps I'm using to locate the problem: HW Monitor, Macs Fan Control.\n[/LIST][INDENT]NOTES: same problem happened with macOS 10.11 El Capitan, and also with other A1309 compatible batteries (ANSANOR and other brands, I've tried 3 different ones).[/INDENT] \n[B]THE PROBLEM:[/B]\n\nShort description:\n\nThe MBP shuts down randomly, specially when working only with battery, but sometimes (less usual) with the AC charger also shuts down or even without battery (only AC charger).\n\nDetails:\n[LIST]\n[*]When it shuts down, I have to press at least twice the Power button to get re-started. First time is a faulty start almost always (front LED turns on of 1-2 seconds and shuts down again).\n[*]Sometimes it does not even arrive to do a full re-start, shuts down during the start up process. Less frequent when powered by AC charger.\n[*]When running on battery only it's way way more complicated to turn it on, almost always fails. Measuring Battery voltage during turn on (without AC charger), it's at 8.3V before Power on, and goes down to 7.7V during turn on process, so it does not seem to go so low (nominal is 7.3V). Measuring the CPU voltage does not get lower than 0.98V on the DMM.\n[*]When running with the AC charger, if it gets disconnected and remains powered only by the battery, usually shuts down. Time can vary from a couple of seconds up to a few minutes, usually remains more time ON when the CPU is not working hard.\n[*]When running without battery, same problem happens, maybe it takes a little bit more time, but ends happening too.\n[*]CPU Core Voltages (as per HW Monitor app) vary from 0.780V up to 1.1V (never stays at one voltage level fixed), confirmed by measuring on <CAPACITOR>C1250</CAPACITOR>-<CAPACITOR>C1253</CAPACITOR> with a DMM.\n[B]8V back and forth in les than 1 second, is this normal? This voltage fluctuates pretty fast (can go back and forth from 0.78V to 0,9 in less than one second periods).[/B]\n[*]CPU temperature arrives at 90ºC (celsius) when reproducing youtube HD videos or other demanding apps. I have Macs Fan Control set to start on CPU1 at 65ºC and max temperature at 80ºC, so they use to be blowing at almost 5000rpm usually.\n[*]I've reseted the SMC, NVRAM, etc...\n[*]Fans are clean of dust.\n[*]Never did a thermal paste renewal.\n[/LIST] ¿Any ideas? ¿Can it be the infamous <CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR>?\n\nThanks in advance!! I hope this can help other people with similar problems ;)"

            "message": "<SIGNAL>SMC_ON_OFF_L</SIGNAL> (2.96V) might be slightly lower then its supposed to, I don't think its bad enough to cause issues however.\n\nThe fact you have 1.1V at <SIGNAL>PP1V1_S0GPU</SIGNAL> means you're in a S0 state so the device is most likely waiting on the CPU to finish its POST routine or other signals indicating boot can continue.\n\nIs <SIGNAL>PP1V1_S0GPU</SIGNAL> stable? Or does it go on and off? (Power cycle)\nVoltage of <SIGNAL>MCP_PS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>? (Is it stable?)\n\nI feel like its possible you've damaged the MCP, have you been careful with heat settings and at least having put on some tape to shield the MCP from direct heat?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI've had many 17\" MacBooks from 2009 with this exact same issue though (Random power-off), never been able to resolve most of them. Issues stayed and did not follow any noticeable pattern, it was truly random."
