        "message":"I've never had the low PPBUS voltage AND a functional SMC so I'm a little confused on this. Liquid spill. Pre-cleaning pics below. 3.4V on pin 2 of R5380 but 1.9V on pin 2 of R5381. Both pullup resistors are good though. Charging data lines tested for continuity. Known good test battery used. Any thoughts where to look on this?"

Once I plug a battery in, the voltage drops down to 1.9V again as the SMC begins to attempt to communicate with the battery. Not sure yet what that's telling me."

The board will now stay on with the battery plugged in but will always give a low battery warning. If I boot into the system it does not recognize the battery. I'm assuming this is still just an SMC issue but wanted to see if it might be something else. And if it is an SMC issue does the donor chip have to be from a 2016 version (with 8GB of RAM) or can I use an older 2015 version?"
