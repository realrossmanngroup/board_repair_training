Then whilst thet still had the mac they sent him this,.\n[ATTACH]60935[/ATTACH]\n\nI agreed to take a look for him.\n\nThe mac wont turn on at all no fan spin, nothing in SMC bypass no real signs of life but I do get trackpad click when power connected,\n\nThe usb Amp meter immediately draws 20v and shows enough Amps to presume its charging the battery on both ports. so I cant see any fault at all with the USB ports they look immaculate and both take 20v and charge the battery,\n\nI tried DFU revive but got the following errors half way through.\n[ATTACH]60936[/ATTACH] [ATTACH]60937[/ATTACH]\n\nI Have never worked on one of these before so any advice on where to start much appreciated."
