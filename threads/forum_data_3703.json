Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution.

I have a MacBook Pro 17\" 2009 with an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2610</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A motherboard that has a green light but it does not turn on. It does not have any signs of water damage, and besides of a few scuffs and dents it looks alright. The customer told me that it simply didn't want to start anymore, as I said no liquid or major signs of mechanic accidents.\n\nWhen I took the board out and connected it to the charger I saw smoke coming out from <TRANSISTOR>Q4260</TRANSISTOR> so I have removed it. His father has a construction company and has a FLIR camera and with that I saw that <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> was the \"hottest\" chip from the motherboard, in fact when connected to charger was the only one hot or rather warm (40[COLOR=#545454][FONT=arial]Â°[/FONT][/COLOR]C).\n\nI have a few measurements :\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.11V\n<SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> - 17V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.41V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> - 3.4V\n\nStill learning so I may write something dumb or ask stupid questions ... so please be patient.\n\nAlso I have another board (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A) with the exact same problems (green light but does not turn on, no liquid damage) but I can't find the brd file to take some measurements, maybe you can help me with it.\n\nThanks !"
