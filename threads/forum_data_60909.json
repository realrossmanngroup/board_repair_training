            "message": "Hey guys,\n\nI have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00164</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> which is giving some problems. Okay so originally it came on with no wifi (not turning on). I checked and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_WLAN</SIGNAL> was only 2.64v. I tested this with board still in frame. Took it out the frame and saw corrosion around L4605. Cleaned that and the system wont boot. G3H was only 2v. Changed the ISL and <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> then g3H was back to normal but still no power. Noticed the 3.3v line was missing , checked out <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> and corrosion was on the pins . Changed that now 3.3v is back but still no power. Looked again under the scope and the EFI had some corrosion, I reflowed it and boom fan spin. Feeling all satisfied I put the unit back together to see if WLAN would be back and no power again. Checking <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> in frame I am getting 8.64 volts for 3 secs then it drops to 4v then back to 8.64v in a continuous loop. What can be the problem? Or where should I start?"
