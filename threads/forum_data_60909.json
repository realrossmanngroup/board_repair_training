Okay so originally it came on with no wifi (not turning on). I checked and PP3v3_WLAN was only 2.64v. I tested this with board still in frame. Took it out the frame and saw corrosion around L4605. Cleaned that and the system wont boot. G3H was only 2v. Changed the ISL and Q7130 then g3H was back to normal but still no power. Noticed the 3.3v line was missing , checked out U7501 and corrosion was on the pins . Changed that now 3.3v is back but still no power. Looked again under the scope and the EFI had some corrosion, I reflowed it and boom fan spin. Feeling all satisfied I put the unit back together to see if WLAN would be back and no power again. Checking PPBUS_G3H in frame I am getting 8.64 volts for 3 secs then it drops to 4v then back to 8.64v in a continuous loop. What can be the problem? Or where should I start?"}
