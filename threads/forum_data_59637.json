        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U4801": "What is U4801? a CHIP.",
        "R7050": "What is R7050? Current sense shunt resistor for the battery, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 17/18 on ISL6259 should give you 2.02 ohms. .",
        "WS_KBD_ONOFF_L": "What is WS_KBD_ONOFF_L? WS_KBD_ONOFF_L is a signal that comes from the keyboard that tells the SMC that the power button has been pressed.  L means whatever before the L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. This signal directly affects SMC_ONOFF_L.",
        "R5115": "What is R5115? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",

Now it turns on when adapter inserted and powers up. if you power it off it powers up again. If you remove the adapter it will stay on with the battery but will not charge. It will turn off using powerbutton but wont power on again.\n\nF7140  = 11.8v\nJ0505 = pins 13/14 = 3.3v\n<RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> = 10k\n\nI have reballed and replaced the smc but still the same.\nI have replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>.\nAny input appreciated"
