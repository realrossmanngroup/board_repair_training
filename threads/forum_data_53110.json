        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D6905": "What is D6905? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input on very old Macbooks(before 2011), can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "C6991": "What is C6991? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "BUF_SMC_RESET_L": "What is BUF_SMC_RESET_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U3100": "What is U3100? a CHIP.",
        "U8510": "What is U8510? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "SMC_PWRBTN_L": "What is SMC_PWRBTN_L? a SIGNAL.",

I can tell where someone else has tried to work on it before me so it's a basket case.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> was at 0.0v when I started. Located a bad cap <CAPACITOR>C6991</CAPACITOR>. Was kind of tricky to find. The resistance at the output of <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> was 25 ohm, then 300 ohm. and I new there were only like three possible caps. It would not show up on thermal. So I tried C691 first and it was my culprate. Then after that I had to replace <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> because the voltage drop across it was almost 2 volts. ( I have seen this a few times now with one of those three caps biting it)\nSo now the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> supply is good and I have 3.4V at both the USB chips.\n\nI have tried each chip using top and bottom usb ports and could see each one in thermal corresponding to it's port. The thermal signature is normal compared to my answer key board. It is now pulling 0.03A constant but no hot spots found. Neither one will give me 20v.\n\nWhat else is required to get to 20v from the charger?"

Probably a missing rail. I have way too many repairs to do today so I don't have more time for this board until next weekend.\n\nI really appreciate your help.  I am quite new to these boards and playing with eBay trash has been a good way for me to learn them."
