Check resistance of R6061 (100k), R6065 (47k), R6060 (47k) (page 45 of schematic) check continuity and shorts to ground in this area - could be Q6060 not controlling properly. Had very similar problem (and ASD results) on an iMac recently and it was one of those resistors that someone had knocked off the board."}
