Check resistance of <RESISTOR>R6061</RESISTOR> (100k), <RESISTOR>R6065</RESISTOR> (47k), <RESISTOR>R6060</RESISTOR> (47k) (page 45 of schematic) check continuity and shorts to ground in this area - could be <TRANSISTOR>Q6060</TRANSISTOR> not controlling properly. Had very similar problem (and ASD results) on an iMac recently and it was one of those resistors that someone had knocked off the board."
