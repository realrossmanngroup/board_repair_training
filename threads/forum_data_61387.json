Replaced all affected components plus the keyboard, trackpad, trackpad connector and trackpad cable. \n\nWhen turned on if the option key is held trackpad works and keyboard works however once booted into OS theres no response from the keyboard or the trackpad.\n\nDoes this sound like bios issue or something else?"
