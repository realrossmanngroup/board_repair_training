        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

The board is like new , no corrosion or oxidation at all . I have seen these boards with some keys not working\nor sticky or .... but never with a complete keyboard totally non responsive .\nI replaced the keyboard cable just in case but that didnt help .\nOn the keyboard connector J4500 I have measured the following :\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_KBD</SIGNAL> = 5V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>     = 3.31 V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL>        = 3.31 V\n\nAny help how to proceed is much appreciated ... I have still hard time accepting all of the keyboard just gave up , I think it is possible but ....\n\nThanks for any help in advance"
