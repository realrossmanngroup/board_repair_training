        "message":"Hi to all you nice people\nI have a 820-00239 board with a non working keyboard , all keys (I mean all) are not responding . The board is like new , no corrosion or oxidation at all . I have seen these boards with some keys not working\nor sticky or .... but never with a complete keyboard totally non responsive .\nI replaced the keyboard cable just in case but that didnt help .\nOn the keyboard connector J4500 I have measured the following :\nPP5V_S0_KBD = 5V\nPP3V3_G3H     = 3.31 V\nPP3V3_S4        = 3.31 V\n\nAny help how to proceed is much appreciated ... I have still hard time accepting all of the keyboard just gave up , I think it is possible but ....\n\nThanks for any help in advance"
