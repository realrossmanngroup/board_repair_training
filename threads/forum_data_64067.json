        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL? This is the voltage coming directly from the charger after going through a transistor. .",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H? PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H is the input voltage to the PP3V42_G3H buck converter circuit, it can be either charger voltage or battery voltage depending on what the system power source is.

        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "C7090": "What is C7090? a CAPACITOR.",

            "message": "I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that came in with no power, not charging. <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> was visibly burned so I replaced it along with <CAPACITOR>C7091</CAPACITOR> which was dead short and appears to have been at least one of the problems. Now when I plug in the charger I get 16.5 volts on the <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL</SIGNAL> side of <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR>, but only about 2.5 volts on the <SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_CONN_R</SIGNAL> side. I have replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> but no change. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> goes to about .7 volts when plugged in and then starts to drop while the probes are connected.\n\n<RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> was blemished and measuring 15 ohms. I also replaced that and measured all other resistors in the area which tested good.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> .700V and dropping when probes are attached diode mode shows .124V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 16.5V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 1.41V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H</SIGNAL> 2.14V\n\n<SIGNAL>DCIN_ISOL_GATE</SIGNAL> 6.8V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL</SIGNAL> 16.5V\n\n\nLogic board is very clean and shows no signs of moisture/corrosion. Any suggestions are appreciated."

            "message": "Thanks for the welcome and for assisting me with this issue. <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> was in fact the problem and now I have a functional charging system! For some reason though, the fan does not work. I tested it using a power supply and it is definitely capable of spinning. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is present at the connector as well as 3.3V on pin 4, <SIGNAL>FAN_RT_TECH</SIGNAL>. That lead me to believe that there was something possibly wrong with <SIGNAL>FAN_RT_PWM</SIGNAL>. Diode mode there shows .510V. Following that to <TRANSISTOR>Q6060</TRANSISTOR> it seems that <RESISTOR>R6060</RESISTOR> was a bit low. About 23k instead of 47k so I replaced it and when that did not change anything, I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q6060</TRANSISTOR>. Still no fan. Since <TRANSISTOR>Q6060</TRANSISTOR> gets data from the SMC is that the next place to look?"
