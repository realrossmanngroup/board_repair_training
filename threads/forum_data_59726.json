When I have the camera plugged in and boot the Mac it will always hang 3\/4 of the way through booting and not enter the macOS. If I unplug the camera the Mac works fine with no issues. It is a 3rd party screen and has never worked on any Mac I have plugged it into. \n\nMy question is this, would it be a good idea to chop the cable and splice another cable on from another MacBook Pro? or is that not the done thing? lol I'm not going to try and replace the camera but the client really wants the camera to work.\n\nAny advice you could give would be much appreciated !\n\nThankyou, Karl"}
