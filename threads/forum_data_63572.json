            "message": "Hello everyone,\n\nFirst time I have tried to upgrade my iMac ram storage from 8GB to 16GB. Let me tell you the story first.\n\nIt had 4 of HYNIX H9CCNNNBLTBL-ARNUD ram (each 2gb) totally 8GB. Then we started to search and found out that my computer is compatible with 16GB of ram too.\nThen we have found another 4 ram chips which makes totally 16GB with the code of ELPIDA FA232A2MA-JD-F. Then we have applied the ram configuration on schematic as you can see attached photos.\n\n1) Removed the <RESISTOR>R1687</RESISTOR> and put 100K resistor to <RESISTOR>R1683</RESISTOR> on RAMCFG0\n2) Removed the <RESISTOR>R1686</RESISTOR> and put 100K resistor to <RESISTOR>R1682</RESISTOR> on RAMCFG1\n3) Removed the <RESISTOR>R1685</RESISTOR> and put 100K resistor to <RESISTOR>R1681</RESISTOR> on RAMCFG2\n4) Kept <RESISTOR>R1684</RESISTOR> on its place on RAMCFg3\n5) Removed the <RESISTOR>R1689</RESISTOR> and put 100K resistor to <RESISTOR>R1688</RESISTOR> on RAMCFG4\n\nBut after I did this configuration the device stays on black screen, I can hear that HDD works, fan spins, no beeps from speaker and the LED lights on the mainboard\nLE0301 (<SIGNAL>ITS_PLUGGED_IN</SIGNAL>), LE0302 (<SIGNAL>CORE_VOLTAGES_ON_R</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>CORE_VOLTAGES_ON</SIGNAL>) but LE0303 (<SIGNAL>MEMORY_GOOD_R</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>MEMORY_GOOD</SIGNAL>) LEDs do not light on. I have waited nearly a minute but nothing changed.\n\nI have checked with thermal camera after plugged in and also press the power button nothing seems short.\n\nAny suggestions or advices you can give me to check because I was struggled with understanding this ram configuration thing? I do still think that I did something wrong there or rams from another mainboard are not working. And is there anyway I can understand if the rams are working or not?\n\nThank you\n\nEmre[ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"1.png\"]60979[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"2.png\"]60980[/ATTACH]"

So I have removed 4 Hynix rams and put 4 elpida rams ( I meant chips with this). I dont know if I need to do something else? Reball the rams maybe?

Also reballed the rams again.\nHow can I inspect if one of the rams is defectice? Only with these tools like Hirens Boot Cd?\nBut wont it beep if there is a problem with a ram or if there is a defective ram?\nAnd I have read articles and I realised that it  could be a bad trace between cpu and ram. And you adviced someone to heat cpu with 180 - 200 degrees for 15 - 20seconds. Should I do that too?\nBecause once it went to internet recovery but it happened for 1 or 2 times then when I press cmd+alt+r it starts loading and at the end it restarts itself. I have a big sur installation usb, when I choose it on boot options it directly goes to screen which gives an error saying your computer needs to be restarted because of a problem, press a key or wait for it - something like that. I dont know what can cause this as I havent heard anyone doing this onboard and ssd upgrades. So I really want to learn everything about this subject. If there is anywhere I can buy these ram chips or SSD chips.\n\nThank you"
