        "message":"Hi all,\n\nI have a nightmare board - quite literally was destroyed by another company.\n\nHistory is liquid damage and some poor rework.\n\nCurrent symptoms: Green light and draws 0.26 amps (CPU\/GPU are warm)\n\nI have replaced the SMC twice now as I thought the above was caused by that and most of the 3.42v net as it was all missing. Q7030 was also shorted and now replaced.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.59v\nPP3V42 = Present along with SMC_BCACOK\n\nCan anyone think of a possible cause for 0.26amps --> i'm starting to think the CPU\/GPU has a short :-(\n\nAny ideas welcome before I say goodbye to this board?"
