This resulted in corrupted EFI. I've replaced it but I'm wondering why this happened.... Would it have written some sort of fucked up variables to NVRAM?\nFresh chip has fixed it of course.\nPRAM reset by the way, would not work because it would chime loop before ending the full chime. Anyone want to guess?"
