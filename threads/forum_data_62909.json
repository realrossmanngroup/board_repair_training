Powered on as soon as I put my ammeter in, pulled 20v booted just fine, was charging battery etc.  Chalked it up to bad luck and put it back together, now it doesn't work again. Now it pulls only .063A and does not loop boot.\n\n1v5 LDO .460 diode mode on all 4 chips\n3v3 LDO .449 \/ .460 all 4\nPPBUS present at 0.6V\n\nMy readings for PPBUS are strange.  Measured at the ppbus fuse it climbs from 0 resistance to 5k resistance.  I've seen this before, it's normal?  Diode readings are similar: .320v to .420V over 10 seconds"}

Same deal with known good batt.  It pulls 5v .0063 A but SOMETIMES it grabs 20v and sticks at 100ma with either battery, connected or disconnected.  I leave it connected for 20 mins and it'll negotiate eventually. Though now it won't.  Tempted to put it in a reflow oven just to see.  Sigh."}

Immediately settles at 5v .0045A draw now.  Does not fluctuate, now doesn't get to 20V no matter how long.  I hate apple."}
