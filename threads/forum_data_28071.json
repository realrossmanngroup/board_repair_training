No idea if no display refers to no backlight, no video or just not booting at all.\n\nI can't get these issues to show up as after 10 times fully power cycling the machine the display is still functioning, but the system had no serial programmed into its bios and its Override file version is reporting back as \"Base_\" in ASD EFI and ASD OS gives me \"no override file detected, please flash before running diagnostics.\" on the startup.\n\nObviously this is not normal, I was wondering how to restore this (other then getting a bios dump online and flashing back that one) what caused this and if this can be (one of the) reason(s) why this system isn't working fully alright? What is the purpose of the Override file version?\nME is reporting as present but if the BIOS got damaged I woudn't be surprised its messed up as well\nI already flashed the serial number back on the machine with BBS v1.1.\n\nCheers"
