            "message": "Hi there, I've got an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> 2017 on my desk with a bit strange issue. Originally there was the keyboard fault (some keys did not work) so I have replaced the keyboard and it started to work. I did not see it before, but now this computer acts like the graphics drivers are not loaded - there is no transparency and when you open any window and try to drag it left and right quickly it does not move smoothly but is lagging a bit. Mac OS is Monterey but I tried Catalina and Big Sur and it's all the same. All voltages seem to be correct (compared to the other logic board), no visible signs of spillage (checked under microscope). How to proceed with the repair?\n\nEDIT: I just found that the camera does not provide any picture - green LED is on but picture inside Photo Booth is black. Is it because the graphics drivers are not loaded or maybe it's something which causes the main issue? Can faulty camera prevent the OS from loading GPU drivers?\n\nEDIT 2: I've ruled out all the external parts (screen, keyboard, battery etc). This is definitely the logic board problem.\n\nEDIT 3: I found on the fully working logic board that <SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0G</SIGNAL> is 0V when on idle and turns on when GPU is loaded, and on the faulty logic board this voltage is always on (0.45V)."
