When you see KERNEL_TASK as a process taking up lots of CPU and the machine is working very slow or has loud fans, use a program like hwmonitor to check voltage, amperage, and temperature sensors and look for something that doesnâ€™t look right..",

Battery charges and it runs off battery so I was happy, but now I am running into a new issue.\n\nThe system is running very slow and <SIGNAL>KERNEL_TASK</SIGNAL> is using up majority of the CPU. When I run ASD it gives the codes PFM006, and PPN001. I installed iStat and found the Left Fin Stack sensor and air flow proximity sensor area reading as empty.\n\nCould you please point me what I should check for? I am out of ideas on what to test since ASD isn't giving useful information. I already checked <SIGNAL>I2C_CPUTHMSNS_SDA</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>I2C_CPUTHMSNS_SCL</SIGNAL> don't have a short to ground, and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_CPUTHMSNS_R</SIGNAL> is getting 3.3v.\n\nI also can't find where the Th1H sensor is located on the motherboard with the schematic.\n\n\nThanks!"
