It will not turn black or anything but just freeze and needs a forced shutdown.\nAfter that, it will always freeze while booting at around 1/4 of the progress bar.\n\nIf we let it sit for a while, it can be booted again just to freeze again on the next GPU intensive task.\n\nWe resoldered <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>, replaced <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>, replaced the GPU twice but it will not make any difference.\n\nAny thoughts?"

Kinda like how some failing graphics chips crash after rising above a certain temp... The resistance is higher in a hot chip then a cold chip so once it gets hot enough, the part of the die that is failing looses its ability to conduct electricity therefore it stops working... After it cools down, it is able to conduct electricity therefore letting it work again..."
