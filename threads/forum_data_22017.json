So no <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL>.\n\nI get no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL>, looking around <TRANSISTOR>Q7910</TRANSISTOR> and Pins 1,2, 5,& 6 are 0v and pins 3 & 4 are 3.3v.\nI think <TRANSISTOR>Q7903</TRANSISTOR> is not getting <SIGNAL>P3V3S3_EN</SIGNAL>, but this won't trigger without <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL> right?"
