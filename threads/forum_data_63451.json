            "message": "Hi,\n\nThis machine stopped working suddenly.\nLike a wrote in the title, the amperage goes to 650mA and after a few seconds drops to 400mA.  CPU and SSD warm a little, but nothing special. \nApparently, sound alike the Logic Board is going to boot normally. But there's no image on display; no image on external display; no backlight on display neither keyboard and no green light on \"caps lock\". Only trackpad clicking.\n \nI already checked on microscope for corrosion signs, and there's no liquid damage. There's no sign of previous intervention on Logic Board or damage in any components.  \n\nChecked all voltages of page 69 (Power Aliases), and all voltages are present. The only voltages that caught my attention were the <SIGNAL>PPVCCCPU_S0G_PH1</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPVCCCPU_S0G_PH2</SIGNAL>. Both goes up to 0.9V, but if i'm right on a normal boot the voltage should drop to 0.6V, wright?"
