This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad..",

The resistor is ok.\nSo, the other side of the resistor was missing <SIGNAL>TBT_X_SPI_MISO</SIGNAL> (3.29V) and this line is created by TBT Titan Ridge - Thunderbolt™ 3 Controllers (<CHIP>U2800</CHIP>).\n\nAfter replacing this big IC it started to get 20V and 2.2Amp, but cycling.\nIt was probably because I don't have the correct stencil to re-ball it and solder it properly. When removing it I heard a pop sound.\n\nI need the Stencil for this IC that I bought from China.\n\nI will come back later to post my findings."
