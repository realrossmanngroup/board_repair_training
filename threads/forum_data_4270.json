It's a liquid-damaged board with scattered spots of corrosion on the top side only. I had to do a lot to fix the ISL chip but that was about it besides PBUS vsense. I've never seen this one before. I've gone over everything I can possible find. I replaced all of the components that looked remotely damaged. Any ideas on what might cause this or where I could go next?"
