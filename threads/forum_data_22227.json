This was a liquid-damaged computer but like most of these it didn't hit the board directly. Normally I would be looking for a short at this point, but I'm not finding anything. Any ideas where to go with this?"}

I would suspect the board is running into a short somewhere and pulling it down. You could inject up to 15V on this bus to see if there is any excess current draw and heating somewhere."}
