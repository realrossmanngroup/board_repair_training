My problem now is that my only 820-2879 donor board was missing the BIOS chip and i pulled one of a 2010 White logic board instead. Is there a way to re-flash this BIOS inside the computer? I don't have any flashing hardware. The computer is working, but I would like it to say \"MacBook Pro Mid 2010\" instead of \"MacBook Mid 2010\" in \"about this computer\""
