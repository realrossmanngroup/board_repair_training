        "820-3787": "What is 820-3787? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "C7717": "What is C7717? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

            "message": "Ignore backlight, we need display first. What voltage is on either side of L8300? Is <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> present going into <CHIP>U8300</CHIP>?\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is related to backlight circuit. Backlight circuit is irrelevant until we have image. First image; THEN backlight!!\n\nYou do not replace <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> if it is not being told to open. <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is P channel mosfet, so usually it will let power through when the voltage on the GATE(pin 3) is lower than the voltage on the source(pin 4) by a significant enough margin. \n\nIf the voltage on pins 3 and 4 are the same, there will be no output. <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is doing its job, so you don't replace it!\n\n<RESISTOR>R7701</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7702</RESISTOR> create a voltage divider that <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> allows a path to ground if it is told that backlight should be on. <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> is not allowing <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> to pass voltage through because the machine doesn't think the LCD is connected/coming on.. so fix that first.

Gave him back just the bottom half of his Mac back.  I'm not handing over my screen. LOL. Fuck but anyways.  Ya I studied your videos for like 9 hours and tested, & tested to the best of my knowledge.  I was also thinking as you are pointing out, but clueless.  Thought I'd question <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> just because I wasn't getting voltage out even though I seen your explanation in videos.  I will study what you have given me fa' sheezy : D  Wish I still had that fucking board.  Fuck the customer and their money I want to fix that fucking board LOL."

Lemme get an easy one, LOL. & then ship them back to you. Not for pay or work, but as a learning tool.  A computer class I once took the back wall was stacked with computers that the teacher sabotaged and we had to pick a random one and fix it."
