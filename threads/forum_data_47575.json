Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."

Cleaned and replaced everything but having difficulty with the backlight fuse. Both pads were beyond bringing back so did scraping in the area to solder replacement fuse and running jumpers on each side of fuse\n\nMy problem is with my jumper for <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> point pin 1 of the fuse. When I run a jumper to <RESISTOR>R5400</RESISTOR> which has <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> to the fuse it smokes and the jumper breaks. Have tried several different gage of wire with no luck.\n\nDo I need to run jumper somewhere else with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> or is something else happening here?"

I would consider soldering the fuse directly to pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> and jumping the other pad of the fuse to something like <RESISTOR>R4260</RESISTOR>. That way you completely cut out the cluster fuck of what's left of the fuse pads and run your circuit away from the mess."
