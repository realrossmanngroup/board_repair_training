Nastiest areas were backlight fuse literally exploded, and it was really gross around the ISL6259. Measured voltages to start:\n\n3V42: 3.46\nPPBUS: 12.58\nPPVRTC: 3.31\nPP5V_S5: 4.99\nPP3v3_S5: 3.3\nPP3V3_S4: 3.3\nPP3V3_S3: 0 volts\n\nI decided to replace the ISL and burned resistors and caps around it: R7000, C7026, C7050, C7000, C7001, C7025. I still get a green light AND quarter fan spin, but now instead of one fan spin and nothing with PPBUS staying constant at 12.58 volts, I get constant quarter fan spins in succession and PPBUS jumps from 15 volts (?) down to 12.58 then to 3.9 and then jumps back up once the fan makes another spin attempt. Where would I look next to resolve this? \n\nThe only other area nasty on the board besides ISL was backlight towards top with a completely destroyed fuse also R5400 had lots of white nasty stuff on it. Other than that the only other part of the board coming into contact with liquid was Q7830 and R7830."}
