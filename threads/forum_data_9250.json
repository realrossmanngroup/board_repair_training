R7715 and R7731 had a bit of corrosion on them so i replaced those. Now I am lacking Voltage on R7731 pin 1 -> PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT. Where does this come from, is this derived from PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_FET Q7706? All looks good, R7788 and R7789 also OK. What voltage should I measure at EDP_BKLT_EN?\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: some more voltages measured:\n\nnothing on D7701\n8.6v on Q7706 pin 3\nDiode Mode on D7701 Pin 1 = 0.262v    Pin 2 = 0.396\nNothing at R7704 BKL_PWM\nR7731 Pin 2 = nothing (well, 25mv)\nresistance to GND on BKL_PWM = 355v"}

Also if you had corrosion on on R7731-R7715 also could be corrosion under U7701 or even dead.... have you tried other lcd assembly????"}

Is there 3V on EDP_BKLT_EN ?\nAlso diagnose SMC_LID, moving to a working machine does not prove anything."}
