    "definitions": {
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT is PPBUS_G3H backlight voltage entering the backlight boost circuit once the transistor has been told to allow it through. .",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_FET": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_FET? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7704": "What is R7704? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7731": "What is R7731? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7715": "What is R7715? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7789": "What is R7789? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7788": "What is R7788? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. ."

Now I am lacking Voltage on <RESISTOR>R7731</RESISTOR> pin 1 -> <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>. Where does this come from, is this derived from <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_FET</SIGNAL> <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>? All looks good, <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> also OK.
