        "820-2530": "What is 820-2530? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D6905": "What is D6905? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input on very old Macbooks(before 2011), can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",
        "U6990": "What is U6990? a CHIP.",
        "U6900": "What is U6900? a CHIP.",
        "U6901": "What is U6901? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line..",
        "R6905": "What is R6905? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on older Macbooks, pre-2011 models. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",
        "R6929": "What is R6929? a RESISTOR.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "C6990": "What is C6990? Capacitor to ground on input to PP3V42_G3H power supply. PP3V42_G3H power supply turns 18.5v from charger or 8.5v-12.5v PPBUS_G3H from the battery into PP3V42_G3H. This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger.",
        "C7771": "What is C7771? Tantalum capacitor on 820-2330 and 820-2532 logic boards that often dies and causes PP1V05_S5_MCP or PP1V05_S5 to be 0.331v instead of 1.05v. If heating this cap restores voltage to this rail, replace.",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H? PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H is the input voltage to the PP3V42_G3H buck converter circuit, it can be either charger voltage or battery voltage depending on what the system power source is. This often shorts to ground when one of the input capacitors dies. ."

I get 3.4v on pins 1/4&5 of <CHIP>U6900</CHIP> but still no green light and <RESISTOR>R6929</RESISTOR> measures good.\n\nI have used 2 different known working magsafe boards.\n\nI have 12.6v on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and 3.3v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> but when I jump the power pads to turn this on nothing turns on.\n\nResistance to ground on Pins 1/4 of Y2810 is around 11.5Megaohms."
