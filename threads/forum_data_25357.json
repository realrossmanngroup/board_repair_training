        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",

Often these are related in a way and I end up resolving both.\n\nDoes it never have a charging light or does the light dim after the system powers off? From your post I think always?\n\nWhat's the voltage of <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> and other SMC RESET signals? Often when weird SMC related issues occur this voltage is slightly dropping to somewhere between 2.3 and 2.9V. Also keep an eye on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> with a fast response multimeter, see if it drops"
