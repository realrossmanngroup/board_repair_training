But the thing will not stop running fast fans despite passing apple internal hardware test. Ive checked HW monitor also and found all temperature sensors reading correctly, none are stuck .ect\n\nThe fans will start ramping up if left in boot menu.\nTried a known good shell and TPAD cable, tried new SMC, tried new EFI with clean ME region. I still have the same problem, Should i try ASD EFI on it just encase HW monitor and Apple hardware test is not picking up on the the issue?"
