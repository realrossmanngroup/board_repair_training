This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",

I'm ready to provide measurements for any component.\n\n<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00239</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board, perfect shape, no liquid damage whatsoever. Below is a list of every component I've replaced so far. I have a donor board I frequently test with, and every component I've listed here has been desoldered from donor and resoldered to the board in question. No change. All were then removed from board and resoldered back to donor, [B]ALL[/B] worked on the donor once again. I'd confidently say everything listed here is \"good\". \n\n-<CHIP>U8400</CHIP> (multiple)\n-<TRANSISTOR>Q8401</TRANSISTOR>\n-<CAPACITOR>C8430</CAPACITOR>\n-<RESISTOR>R8432</RESISTOR>\n-<RESISTOR>R8431</RESISTOR>\n-<DIODE>D8410</DIODE>\n-<CAPACITOR>C8410</CAPACITOR>\n-<TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR>\n-<RESISTOR>R8400</RESISTOR>\n-<RESISTOR>R8402</RESISTOR>\n-<RESISTOR>R8401</RESISTOR>\n-<CAPACITOR>C8412</CAPACITOR>\n\n\nTried all common solutions after checking for shorts, no shorts on C84XX caps, so I didn't replace any. No current passing through C84XX caps. My best guess is that <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> is somehow not receiving an enable signal. Forgive my ignorance on this board, I got caught up in firing the parts cannon at it without thoroughly researching the schematics, only because I have the luxury of multiple donors. I have only had experience with dead <CHIP>U8400S</CHIP> and blown C84XX caps on this board, though I've had many. \n\nHope someone can point me in the right direction, thanks!"

Multiple PRAM resets, swapped J8500 cable for known good one, good <RESISTOR>R8450</RESISTOR>-53 lines. I will backtrack and see if I've done anything to kill the image, I was very careful measuring SCL/SDA lines, and touched nothing else. They measured around 5V each, and that's the moment I noticed there was no longer an image displayed.\n\nI'm wondering if this image issue is intermittent and related to no backlight. Mac belongs to a friend of mine, and she swears she saw nothing with flashlight when backlight went out, though when left with me, I could see her login screen using one. I'm starting to believe now she may have been correct. I'm considering replacing J8500, even though it's in great shape, I need to rule out everything at this point.\n\nThanks again, I hope I can narrow this down tomorrow."
