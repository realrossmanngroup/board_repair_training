        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

            "message": "The first time i was working on this board it had kernel panic issues and was always rebooting. It was an apple refurbished board in bad condition. There was a long screw in a short hole on the left side of J8500 and the right side of J6600. The BIOS <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> had  a short to GND at pin8. I changed the BIOS and a view other bad looking parts and did a ultrasonic. After this the board was running for a view month.\n\nNow the machine came back with randomly rebooting issue. I was testing it over days and weeks. Sometimes the machine was running over days without any problems. Sometimes it didn't wake up after closing and opening the lid. Sometimes it did nothing like dead. And then after sac-reset etc. it was working again.\n\nI can't find any visual damage. At the moment i stuck with this board.
