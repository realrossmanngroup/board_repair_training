        "message":"The first time i was working on this board it had kernel panic issues and was always rebooting. It was an apple refurbished board in bad condition. There was a long screw in a short hole on the left side of J8500 and the right side of J6600. The BIOS U6100 had  a short to GND at pin8. I changed the BIOS and a view other bad looking parts and did a ultrasonic. After this the board was running for a view month.\n\nNow the machine came back with randomly rebooting issue. I was testing it over days and weeks. Sometimes the machine was running over days without any problems. Sometimes it didn't wake up after closing and opening the lid. Sometimes it did nothing like dead. And then after sac-reset etc. it was working again.\n\nI can't find any visual damage. At the moment i stuck with this board. The naked board is booting and shows the low battery symbol for 5-10 seconds on a external display, then it gets a blank screen and most of the rails are down.\n\nHere are my measurements - measured at the time the low battery symbol is shown on the screen (ore before):\n\nPPDCIN_G3H = 20,4V\nPPBUS_G3H = 13,08V\nPP5V_S5 = 5,01V\nPP3V3_G3H = 3,40V\nPP3V3_S4 = 3,31V\nPP3V3_S0 = 3,31V\nPP1V8_S3 = 1,78V\nPP1V2_S3 = 1,18V\nPPVTT_S0 = 0,58V\nPP0V6_S3_MEM_VREFDQ_A = 0,60V\nPP0V6_S3_MEM_VREFCA_A = 0,60V\nPP0V6_S3_MEM_VREFDQ_B = 0,60V\n\nCPU Rails\nPPVCCCPU_S0G = 0,9 \/ 0,7 \/ 0,62V\nPPVCCSA_S0G = 1,03 \/ 0,7 \/ 0,83V\nPPVCCGT_S0G = ---\nPP1V2_S3 = 1,18V\nPPVCCIO_S0G = 0,94V\nPP1V_S3 = 0,98V\nPP1V_S0G = 0,98V\nPP1V2_S0G = 1,18V\n\nPCH Rails\nPP3V1_RTC = 3,07V\nPP3V3_S5 = 3,31V\nPP3V3_S5G = 3,31V\nPP1V_S5G = 0,99V\nPP1V8_S5G = 1,78V\nPPVCCPCH_S5G = 0,99V\nPP1V_S5GTD = 0,98V\nPP1V8_S0 = 1,78V\nPP3V3_S0 = 3,31V\nPP3V3_S4 = 3,31V\n\nSSD Rails\nPP3V3_S5_SSD_SNS = 3,31V\n\nPP3V3_TBT_X_S0 = 3,31V\nPU_VSNS_CPU_VCCGTX_TP = ---\nPD_VSNS_CPU_VCCGTX_TN = ---\nPP3V3_S4_WLS = 3,32V\nPPBUS_G3H_TPAD = 13,09V\nPP5V_S0 = 5,11V\nPPBUS_G3H = 13,09V\n\nUSB-C GLOBAL POWER ALIASES\nPP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO = 3,38V\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO = 3,38V\nPP5V_S4 = 5,11V"
