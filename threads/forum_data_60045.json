How about the peripherals? Both boards are for A1278 macbooks.\nDoes it mean the peripherals of one model are compatible with those of the other?\n\nIs there a way to infer compatibility between componets on different boards beloung to the same\nfamily - ie. all A1278 mackbooks, for example?\n\nOn the Apple site @ [URL]https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT201608[\/URL] for each model a model Identifier and\none or more Part Numebers are provided. Does it mean a componet of a certain part Number is compatible\nwith all laptops listing it?\n\nI am trying to see if there is a reliable method to establish compatibility bewteen parts, without taking a trail\nand error approach which could results in some components getting bricked."
