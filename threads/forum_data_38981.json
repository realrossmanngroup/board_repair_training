            "message": "Hello everyone.\nlast week I got a macbook air <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with reports that it stopped working.\n\nwas told a few months prior to this that it was exposed to a tiny bit of water.\n\nalso was told in the last 2 months prior to it dying that it was turning off earlier then what battery says.\n\nmy findings.\nupon examination I checked one wire circuit and it works.\nchecked 8v line and it works.\nno 5v ot 3.3v line work.\nnothing on top side stranded out as corrosion..\nhowever on the bottom side I noticed corrosion around <RESISTOR>R1661</RESISTOR> and the 3 test point closest to it were completely dead. So <RESISTOR>R1661</RESISTOR> pin 1 that runs to the test point was down. I could not solder a jumper back to it because the pad was so corroded l. Also line for <RESISTOR>R1663</RESISTOR> pin 1 line was down to test point, same for <RESISTOR>R1669</RESISTOR> pin 1 to test point.\n\nforgive my boorish question, I'm unfamiliar with board view. I normally fix iPhones.\n\nis that test point the only means of communication that the resistors have ?\n\ncan I use board view to check what is on the test point line for that specific resistor and run a jumper to closest component?\n\nalso am I wasting time ?\nwill any of these resistors cause no power on ?\n\nthanks again. Any advice or help is appreciated"
