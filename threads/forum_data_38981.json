So r1661 pin 1 that runs to the test point was down. I could not solder a jumper back to it because the pad was so corroded l. Also line for r1663 pin 1 line was down to test point, same for r1669 pin 1 to test point.\n\nforgive my boorish question, I'm unfamiliar with board view. I normally fix iPhones.\n\nis that test point the only means of communication that the resistors have ?\n\ncan I use board view to check what is on the test point line for that specific resistor and run a jumper to closest component?\n\nalso am I wasting time ?\nwill any of these resistors cause no power on ?\n\nthanks again. Any advice or help is appreciated"}
