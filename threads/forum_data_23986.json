            "message": "Repaired a board that had some very minor liquid damage to <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3210</CHIP>. Got everything cleaned up, went to test the board, and all is fine except the Thunderbolt port. I noticed that whenever I plug a device into the Thunderbolt port, it causes the unit to slooooowww down and throttle itself almost as if a sensor is damaged. Trackpad movement is incredibly slow (even slower than when a bad trackpad is installed, etc). When I unplug the thunderbolt cable, all returns to normal immediately.\n\nWhen troubleshooting, I noticed I pulled a <CHIP>U3210</CHIP> from an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board to repair this one; I didn't realize this chip was actually different between the two boards. I replaced the chip with a proper one (from another 00165), and the issue persists.\n\nSystem Preferences does not show anything connected (\"No device connected\") when I plug in a Thunderbolt monitor (that I use to test all boards with). Everything around the area looks fine where the liquid spill was.\n\nAny idea what the issue could be? Did I fuck something up by installing a slightly different chip? This is a customer board, so unfortunately they will want Thunderbolt working of course. Any ideas appreciated!"

            "message": "A bit of an update, as I've found out some more information:\n\nThe unit WILL WORK on Thunderbolt (without any throttling) at the OS login window. I can connect the unit with Thunderbolt, and the display will be detected and work fine. I log into OSX, and it still works fine (no throttling), however System Information still shows \"No Device Connected\" in the Thunderbolt info window. If I unplug the thunderbolt cable at this point, and then re-plug it in, it doesn't work any more and I get the throttled/slowness issue. It will only work (and not cause the throttling) if I plug in the monitor at the OS login screen.\n\nHopefully this information will help in some way. I'm going to try a new test assembly, just in case the SSD is causing issues (I can't otherwise figure how the thunderbolt port would work at OS login, but not in OS). Also, I don't know why the device window for Thunderbolt says \"No Device Connected\" even as an external display is connected and working (as I had plugged it in at OS login).\n\nReally odd."
