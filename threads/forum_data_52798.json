            "message": "What I do is a little unorthodox but it works quite well. If there is corrosion I bush it with vinegar and a wetting agent (soap) using a micro glass fiber brush to clean surface corrosion. Some times if it is bad I will let the vinegar / soap solution stay on he board for 5-10 minutes before power washing.. Then I take it to my sink and power wash it with a water pick. I use warm water and soap and blast under all the BGA packages. Even the CPU / Ram and SMC. Then I rise with warm water. Last I use my air compressor to blast all the water off the board and blow under the BGA packages, plugs etc. I even wash the CPU fans on the board to get the crud out this same way. Some times i will use hot air to finish it off but usually I don't. Often the board is in / out in under 10 minutes and I have it back in the machine testing it.\n\nI have considered getting a large ultra sonic and probably should but this works every time. The Ultrasonic I have is too small for MacBook boards so when I started working on them I improvised this process. It has worked so well I have not got around to buying a bigger Ultrasonic.\n\nOne of my customers tries to fix the MacBooks before sending them to me and uses a ultra sonic to clean their boards. Usually what I do comes out better. Just depends on the corrosion.\n\nLots of ways to do the same thing. I am sure I will get flamed for doing it this way but it works for me. I fix about 10 machines a day and 2-3 end up needing aggressive cleaning.\n\nMicro-Fiber towels are my best friend! I buy a large pack every so often at CostCo and use them to soak up alcahol after I clean with the micro fiber glass brush. You can't tell where the flux was and they come out great. Once my towels are dirty I just wash them in the laundry. Some times I throw the nasty ones away but usually I just keep washing and reusing them. The fresh nice ones I save for screen cleaning etc. The nasty ones get demoted to flux cleanup. I don't use consumables such as paper towels or swabs.\n\nI have had been given nasty boards that were literally coated in flux.  For those I will just wet the micro fiber towel with Alchol directly and wipe the board clean.   Works great!  I can't live without a micro fiber towel."

Your dishwasher is made to clean stuff and not leave spots. hmm. Would you believe that your dishwasher is the BEST ever??!! A good ultrasonic cleaner will eat away at the end caps of SMD components like resistors, mlcc caps, etc. If corrosion has already eaten most of it away: ultrasonic cleaner should be your last choice."

Hope all this helps someone later on."
