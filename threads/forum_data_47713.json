The symptoms are:\n\nRandom shutdowns\nGraphical Anomalies Before shutdown,\nMissing RAM Beep, even with RAM installed\n\nI have replaced RAM on all units with the no progress.\n\nInterestingly enough, I discovered that if I apply pressure on to the RAM Slot while any of these boards are on, I am able to replicate the Graphical anomalies. It seems like there is something wrong around the RAM slots on the boards. I have attached an image of the anomalies. Has anyone else seen this issue before on this model board?"}

Best to max out working slot and leave it be."}

I had a feeling the pins could be the issue. I will touch up the pins to the board with some solder. If that doesn't fix it, I will then max out the working slot like you mentioned. Thanks again!"}
