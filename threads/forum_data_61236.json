        "message":"Hello there,\n\nI could use some advise \/ tips & tricks \/ do's & don'ts \/ confirmation with following:\nI have an A1398 with no backlight, the LCD works properly. The motherboard is ok, a spare screen lights up as usual.\n\nThe probable cause is a short under the connector at the display side. I spotted corrosion on the connector. I assume the user spilled too much cleaner on the screen in the assumption she\/he could wipe off the staingate issue...\n\nThere is quite some corrosion on pins 1-5 being PPVOUT LCDBKLT, I2C BKLT SCL and SDA, so it is logical this is the cause. \n\nThere is a cap underneath the LCD PCB - what should this measure? \n\nHow do I repair this in the most safe way? I thought of following:\n-Put a heat buffer below LCD print (alu-foil or so)\n-Pre-heat to max 60 degrees Celsius\n-Remove connector with wide soldering pin\n-Clean residue with alcohol\n-Solder new connector\n-How do you remove the flux (standard Amtech) that gets in the connector while soldering???\n-Measure for shorts\n-Give it a try\n\nAny experiences with this kind of issue would be very welcome because it is either a fix of 10 or 300 \u20ac if I screw up...\n\nBest regards,\nStijn\n\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59898[\/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]59899[\/ATTACH]"

        "message":"Thank you so much, I didn't know the existence of ChipQuick. \nCould have avoided a lot of misery with this...\n\nTo understand correctly: the 138 degrees solder paste and the ChipQuik are alternatives to get the job done right? It is or the one, or the other.\n\nIf soldering a new connector on and Flux like the Amtech 559 gets inside the connector, is treating it with alcohol removing it all in your opinion. \nI realise this is a very basic question, but couldn't find a proper answer online, while I have some difficult experiences with it (and I do not have an ultrasonic cleaner)."
