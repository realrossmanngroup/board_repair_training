I only ask as the schematic does not mention voltages coming from <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> or <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> only going into them.\nThanks\n\nI am also thinking isl 6259 needs replacing, but I want to know bout <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> first. Checking pins 27 - 28 of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and pin 19-20 all is well.\nThanks"
