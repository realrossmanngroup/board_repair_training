It would sometimes boot up to login window, then after a few minutes it starts to have very bad image artifacts. Found light corrosion around UB300. Repaired\/replaced corroded caps and resistors around UB300. Pulled a corroded cap on the hall effect sensor (J5260). Some corrosion by UB400. All corrosions have been cleaned off and UB300\/UB400 don't seem to have been affected by the corrosion due to what appears to be an insulating material\/past covering it's sides\/corners. \n\nStill have the same issue where sometimes it would power up all the way to login screen, then after a few minutes image artifacts start to form. But most times it just won't boot, cpu still gets warm. Not sure where to start on this one. Any suggestions?"}

That section of the board was very clean with no sign of spill or precious work done."}
