If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed â€“ if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

            "message": "Hi There,\nThis is the first time i had to fix a screen backlight circuit on this model and i have a very weird issue.\n\nThe backlight driver was badly damaged with many traces around it. Measuring continuity on the sense circuit from one side of the board to the other seems to be connected.\n\nIf I have the charger connected and turn on the device it works fine. If I disconnect the charger it still works fine. I can control the screen backlight and open and close the lid it still works.\n\nIf I shut down the device and turn it on without the charger connected almost always the screen backlight is off. Increasing it in the OS doesn't fix it. In this state if i connect a charger it comes on immediately and if I disconnect it, it stays on.\nAny idea what can be causing this and what should i check?"
