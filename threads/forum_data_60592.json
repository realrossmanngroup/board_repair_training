When I plug in my flash drive [I]and[\/I] charger together, it fries my flash drive and sends 20v straight to the drive (already fried 3 drives before realizing this happened). Could this be an issue with CD3215?\n\nIssue 2: Right side usb ports don't work at all (I'm guessing cd3215 is fried on the right side?)\n\nIs issue #1 something you've seen before, and is there someplace I should look? Am I on the right track for issue #2? I haven't taken the logic board out yet since this is my primary laptop, but wanted to get a consult before I start replacing things.\n\nThanks!"}
