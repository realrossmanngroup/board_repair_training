The resister is restricting the flow, allowing the difference.\nIf R7402 had 0 resistance (just for example), then voltage would be the same both sides and some component further up the ::2 side of the line would be getting hot.\n\nBoard looks spotless."}

Maybe pulling them off is a cleaner solution.\nOnce an EFI chip (13\"Retina board) cracked in half when it came off and it turned into a nightmare. So I've been reluctant to pull them off unless I have to ever since. Of course you could say it was already compromised which is what lead me to remove and flash it in the first place."}
