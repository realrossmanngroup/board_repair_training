Heated GPU some and video returned. After GPU replacement I had chime backlight and video again but red distortion in the background and osx wouldn't fully load. At first reflowed VRAM but then no video. After reballing all vrams I still have no backlight or video but it still chimes.\n\nNot missing any components around vram.  Could the vram gone bad or possibly something else? Also applied leaded solder to U8900 to rule it out but no change"}
