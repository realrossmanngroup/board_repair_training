After GPU replacement I had chime backlight and video again but red distortion in the background and osx wouldn't fully load. At first reflowed VRAM but then no video. After reballing all vrams I still have no backlight or video but it still chimes.\n\nNot missing any components around vram.  Could the vram gone bad or possibly something else? Also applied leaded solder to <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> to rule it out but no change"
