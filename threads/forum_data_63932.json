During my initial checks, I noticed that <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> was getting hot, and I realized that there was a short circuit in the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO</SIGNAL> line. I replaced <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>, but then I noticed that PI3USB32224BXEAE was getting hot. I removed this component, and I haven't been able to replace it yet. Currently, the motherboard is drawing 5V at 0.021A, and then it goes back to 5V at 0.000A - 5V at 0.021A continuously. Is it happening because PI3USB32224BXEAE is missing, or is it due to a different issue?"
