        "message":"Hey guys.  I have a 2109 A2116 iMac which the customer upgraded the SSD on with a PCIe adapter.  Since the upgrade he got no display on the LCD but does get external display.\n\nInitial Inspection we found the LCD cable to be damaged so we bought another, same issue, bought a new screen, same issue. Usual PRAM RESET stuff no change.\n\nTaken the board out for inspection under the scope and can't find anything obvious, we've tried booting without the new SSD and adapter no change.\n\nCan't find schematic\/board view or any diode reading for the LCD connector.\n\nAnyone have experience of this issue with maybe a different model that could point me in the right direction at all?"
