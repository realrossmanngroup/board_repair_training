I replaced all missing IC and cleaned it. I got PPBUS at 12.56v and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> on L7560, on L7520 0v. Looking at <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>, I got 3.42v on pin 12. <SIGNAL>P5VS3_EN</SIGNAL> comes up high for a split second when connecting the charger and then drops to 0. I have on <CAPACITOR>C7524</CAPACITOR> 4.8v on pin 1 and 0v on pin 2. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> is present on <CAPACITOR>C7505</CAPACITOR> and 12.56v on VIN. Ideas?\n\nEDIT: green and orange light on charger"
