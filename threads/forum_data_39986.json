        "message":"I have this board which had quite some liquid damage and was molested by another shop before. Since it is not too busy I decided to give it a try. I replaced all missing IC and cleaned it. I got PPBUS at 12.56v and PP3V3_S5 on L7560, on L7520 0v. Looking at U7501, I got 3.42v on pin 12. P5VS3_EN comes up high for a split second when connecting the charger and then drops to 0. I have on C7524 4.8v on pin 1 and 0v on pin 2. PP5V_S5 is present on C7505 and 12.56v on VIN. Ideas?\n\nEDIT: green and orange light on charger"
