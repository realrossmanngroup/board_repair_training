        "message":"Please, can someone clean the ME REGION on this EFI\/BIOS? Please clean this bin and not just upload a clean version. This bin is original to this Logic Board I am working on. The reason I need CLEAN ME is I just replaced the PCH\/Intel Graphics because it was cracked. Now the system boots but hangs because of the ME REGION I am sure. Logic Board is an 820-3787 2.3GHZ 16GB w\/ Dedicated 2Gb GPU. \n\n[url]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1pKdzvPrt-yrMHx1xa7i3fgIZESvaEGiW\/view?usp=sharing[\/url]\n\nThanks in advance!"

I installed the original bin and it turns back on but hangs on the Apple Logo so I know my soldering and loading the bin is good. \n\nCan you please retry and only clean the ME? My original file I sent boots but with the revision, it doesn't boot now. \n\nThanks again in advance!"
