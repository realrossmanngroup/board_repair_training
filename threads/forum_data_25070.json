            "message": "I'm working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that had some sort of power incident. <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> was blown in half with a minor hole in the board (just that top ground plane, easy to isolate and repair). I got the <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>/<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> issue all worked out. They were all taken out, and had to be replaced. Once replaced, I get green light (no light before) and fan spin. I noticed someone had fucked with the BIOS chip at some point, so I loaded up a clean dump (clean ME region, one that I've used 10+ times before), and still no chime, video/BL, etc., just continuous fan. Tried dump on another board to be sure, and it works well.\n\nBoard heats up as it should and my vcore is present (light on mouse present). I didn't find any other missing rails (<SIGNAL>3V3_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>5V_S0</SIGNAL>, ppbus, 3v42, vrtc, all present and steady). Any direction from here would be much appreciated.\n\nI'll go through all my pgood signals tomorrow, but am I correct in thinking that if vcore is present and fans spin, that my pgood signals (p1v8s0, 1v5s0, etc) are all present and not waste time there, or should I check elsewhere?"
