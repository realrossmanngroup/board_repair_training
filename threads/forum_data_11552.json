            "message": "Board has very weird behavior.\nIt did not had green light initially. Changed the IO board. That fixed it.\nAfter some days of sitting I could not get green light again so got out the board then I could have green light.\nSo I checked the flex cables and came to the conclusion that there is something with the battery led flex. When it is not connected everything is okay.\nTried with another one. It works but if I try the old one and then change it to the new one it will not get green light always.\nSo I was thinking could it be something else on the board?\nChecked connector with microscope. Visually looks fine."
