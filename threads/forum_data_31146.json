Why you say \"wont go above 5.39kohm\" is a mystery to me as it needs to be lower not higher.\n\nBut I hope you realize that in the end when you fixed this issue and this board still has its original 2011 GPU it will be a matter of time before that dies. Unless you intend to replace the GPU this board can never be considered reliable in any way. With a new GPU they are good for about 2-3 years and it WILL die again."
