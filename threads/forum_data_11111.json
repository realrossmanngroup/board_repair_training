        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP.",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal.."

Board does not have a single discolored pad or spot of corrosion or any indication of liquid at all. Testing board in one of my known-good assemblies with a genuine charger, of course.\n\n- Nothing gets warm\n- No shorts detected on 3v42 or ppbus\n- <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is low (8.16v)\n- <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is 3.34v at <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>\n- <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> is 4.36v at <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>\n- <SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> is 3.42v at pin 19 of J9500\n\nPretty stumped on this one. I thought for sure there would be a short on ppbus when I saw it only measured 8.16v, but there isn't. Thought maybe <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> was bad, but it doesn't get warm and is putting out proper <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> (<SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> is 4.36v).\n\nAll help appreciated, duke."

The last 2 of these I replaced the SMC on (those 2 had 3v42 shorts that ended up being the SMC), the CPU ended up being dead. I hope that's not the case for this one, but will report back. I haven't gone through everything yet, but wanted to update that replacing SMC (not reflow--replaced with new chip since the other one was perfectly clean underneath, probably dead completely) did bring back green light.\n\nStay tuned. If anyone has anything to chime in with (common fault to check on this model board, etc), that would be great. From my experience with this board, it seems to be a colossal piece of shit compared to the 3437 boards."
