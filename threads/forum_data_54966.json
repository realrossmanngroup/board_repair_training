My 3V3 and 5V rails that U7501 is responsible for were good!  However the machine did pull about 200mA too much power.  \nThermal imaging showed U7501 was getting too hot.   I could not find any shorts around this IC so I decided to replace it even though I was shaking my head how.   Over heating of U7501 was now fixed and power rails as before were still good but the board was not booting.\n\nPresently all rails are up and we have S0 good.  \nCPU loads bios and starts RAM activity.  \nBoard does not cycle three times like normal and never enables the screen.\n\nWe are currently brain dead.  This is a very old board and I am going to total it.  but OMG what the hell is this?"}
