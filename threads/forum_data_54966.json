My 3V3 and 5V rails that <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> is responsible for were good!  However the machine did pull about 200mA too much power.  \nThermal imaging showed <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> was getting too hot.   I could not find any shorts around this IC so I decided to replace it even though I was shaking my head how.   Over heating of <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> was now fixed and power rails as before were still good but the board was not booting.\n\nPresently all rails are up and we have S0 good.  \nCPU loads bios and starts RAM activity.  \nBoard does not cycle three times like normal and never enables the screen.\n\nWe are currently brain dead.  This is a very old board and I am going to total it.  but OMG what the hell is this?"
