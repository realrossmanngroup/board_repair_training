            "message": "Got a 00840 trolling me. Came in no liquid with a history of a dog biting it. First thing I checked was output on external. Nothing, Unplugged the screen and tried again. Nothing. This was with a genuine apple usb c to vga dongle. Checked CPU vcore... 0.94 volts. GPU vcore - 0v. Missing <SIGNAL>GTVR_FCCM</SIGNAL>. I thought it was <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, replaced it with no change. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> drops to 0v every 30 secs then goes back up only near the GPU fets.  I cant find a 00840 schematic so im using a 00875 schematic which is close. GPU is not shorted. \n\nAt this point, i dont know what more it can be. I'm guessing fets, but I dont want to put heat to that area if I dont have to. Anything else I can check before replacing the FETs and <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> again?"

Now to what FCCM means I have no idea. Im going to look around at similar intersil/renesas chips and see if I can figure out what that pin does. I know its suppose to be 5v. Maybe the FETs are messed up. I dont know, but if the fets are messed up, the GPU could have gotten killed. Hard to say on this one. Ill keep digging."
