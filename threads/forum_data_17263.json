When using older 85w charger green light shows solid but still won't power on.  After disconnecting the battery for 30 seconds and reconnecting the battery, the machine automatically boots (with dong).  Once machine boots (normal and quickly) battery shows X inside battery icon on menu bar.  Ghosting of display brightness being dimmed to black screen happens intermittently.  No signs of liquid damage.  Also customer reported a recent drop and HDMI port and USB port on right side now working.  \n\nAny ideas?"}

And the only way I can get it to power on is plugging in the charger or (without the charger connected)  I can disconnect and then reconnect the battery and it will power on.  When it does boot up I can verify that the keyboard is working.  But when it is powered down the power button on the keyboard will not power it on."}
