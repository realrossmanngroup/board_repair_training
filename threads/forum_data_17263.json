            "message": "Got a <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> when it came in it would not power on and no light on charger (brand new charger 85w).  When using older 85w charger green light shows solid but still won't power on.  After disconnecting the battery for 30 seconds and reconnecting the battery, the machine automatically boots (with dong).  Once machine boots (normal and quickly) battery shows X inside battery icon on menu bar.  Ghosting of display brightness being dimmed to black screen happens intermittently.  No signs of liquid damage.  Also customer reported a recent drop and HDMI port and USB port on right side now working.  \n\nAny ideas?"
