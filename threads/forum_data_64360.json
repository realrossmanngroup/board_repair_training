(diode mode: 0.406, it seems good as well) \nI took off U9300 suspecting maybe its pulling 5V S2 down.. but still 5V S2 was fluctuating..\nTo save time I changed UC260 ([B]5V S2 VR[\/B]) directly.. and still 5V S2 was fluctuating..\n\nI measured the enable signal ([B]P5VS2_PWR_EN[\/B]) and it was low (0.550v) and unstable as well.. and it comes from MPMU U8100..\nI measured [B]IPD_PWR_EN_PMU[\/B] and it was absent.. [B]IPD_PWR_HOLD[\/B] was absent too.\n\n[B]5VS2_PWR_EN[\/B] diode 0.714\n[B]IPD_PWR_EN_PMU [\/B]diode 0.714\n[B]IPD_PWR_HOLD [\/B]diode 0.692\n\nI don't want to blame U8100 directly and since I need to order these chips and it requires a lot of time.. is there anything else I need to checkup? something I looked over?"}
