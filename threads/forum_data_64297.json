        "message":"hello,\n\nthis board came in for liquid mainly on the trackpad connector \/ battery.. PPBUS was shorted to ground until I removed the trackpad connector on MLB and it was gone.. I noticed that the backlight IC had minor corrosions around it.. I ordered a bunch of ICs online and replaced it.. \n\nthe computer switches to 20V and shows Apple logo (no BL) and shuts off then restarts and does the whole thing again; 5V > 20V > Apple logo > restart\n\nNo voltage on PPVOUT LUXE \n\nPPBUS is there \nPPBUS LUXE is there \n3v8 AON is there \nBL PWR EN is there \n5V S2 is there"
