Made a visual inspection of the board, and oddly enough there where no sign og water damage at all.\nThe <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> had a small crater on it so it got replaced. After replacing the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> I got green light and the fan started. Mounted the board back in the machine and found the machine running quite slow and not recognizing the battery. Tried with a well known battery, but still nothing. The BIL doesn't show anything when pressing the button either (tried two different ones as well).\nThe board does run on a charged battery but does not show up in OS. Ran ASD with noe errors.\n\nStarted measuring around the board:\n- Current sensing resistors <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR>-52 seems fine\n- <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> Pin 5 is only 5-7V when battery is not connected\n- <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR> both measures good, and is receiving 3,42V\n- The J6955 looks great\n\nWhile sitting here writing I just realized that I haven't checked <DIODE>D6950</DIODE> or <RESISTOR>R6950</RESISTOR> yet. I will do this ASAP.\n\nI do fear a bad SMC, but if anyone has any suggestion to other things I should check I would appreciate if you shared with me :)"

Do I need to re-ball the SMC or is it possible to do this only by adding solder to the pads?"
