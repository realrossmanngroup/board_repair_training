    "definitions": {
        "820-3787": "What is 820-3787? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "SYSCLK_CLK32K_RTC": "What is SYSCLK_CLK32K_RTC? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVOUT_S0_PCH_DCPRTC": "What is PPVOUT_S0_PCH_DCPRTC? a SIGNAL."

No cycling. No shorts on CPU, which is rare with this model. No other shorts that I can find. <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is fine. Not sure where to go next. Any thoughts?"
