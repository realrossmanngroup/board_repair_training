PPBUS_G3H at F7700 pin 1 = 8.57v\n3. PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS at R5450 pin 1 = 8.57v\n4. PP3V3_S5 at U3560 pin 5 = 3.325v\n5. PP15V_TBT at D3095 pin 2 = 0.00v\n6. PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS at Q7560 pin 1 = 8.57v\n\nso seems like there is problem with 15V boost is it?\n\n1. PPBUS_G3H at C3080 pin 1 showing 8.57v\n2. before i change Q3080 from scrap board,i get only 0.0v at L3095 pin 1,but after change from another scrap board,i get 7.90v at L3095 pin 1 and slowly decreasing.\n\nwhat should i do next?"}

Replaced Q7130,now PPDCIN_G3H stable at 16.5v and charger LED show green and turn orange,and fan spin for 2 second and gone."}
