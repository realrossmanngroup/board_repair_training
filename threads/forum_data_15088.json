I ran the efi diagnostics and it told me the trackpad cable was the issue so I replaced that and the machine was working fine a couple hours ago. I decided to clean the corrosion from the liquid damage which was only around the following areas.\n<TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q1930</TRANSISTOR> (attached image)\n<RESISTOR>R8158</RESISTOR>/59\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7310</TRANSISTOR> (very light and only on pin 1 side)\n\nI just put some flux and heated the area to remove corrosion. I replaced <RESISTOR>R8152</RESISTOR>&<RESISTOR>R8158</RESISTOR> because they looked burned on one side. After doing those repairs the board no longer turns on even though <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> are present.\n\nI measured <RESISTOR>R8167</RESISTOR> and on Pin 1(<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_BUF_L</SIGNAL>) there was 3.32v and Pin 2(<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>) there was 0.11v. I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U1930</CHIP> since they were connected to <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> but that didn't change anything.\n\n\nUpdate: I see a little corrosion on the <CAPACITOR>C1924</CAPACITOR> side of the <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> clock chip and <CAPACITOR>C1924</CAPACITOR> looks slightly black on one side. Could that be causing this and should I go ahead and replace this?\n\nAlso I see <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> has some corrosion on pin 1 but 3.4v was present on all pins except for pin 2. Pin 4 (<SIGNAL>SMC_MANUAL_RST_L</SIGNAL>) - 2.78v"
