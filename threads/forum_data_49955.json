No sign of water damage or corrosion.\n\nHere are the measurements taken:\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.6v\nPPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H - 20.09v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS - 8.7v\nPPVBUS_LIO - 20.11v\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.32v\nPP3V3R3V0_AON - 33v\nPPVRTC_G3H - 0v\nPP5V_G3H - 4.92v\nPP5V_S5 - 5.02v\nPP5V_S0SW_LCD - 0v\nPP5V_S4 - 0v\n\nAlso CPU is warm.\nResistance of PPVRTC_G3H 1.2ohms. Pulled all 3 (C0900, C0901 and C7880) caps to confirm none were shorted and the short remained. I'm assuming U7800 is specific to the board? Also the fact that the CPU is warm, is it possible that's it's the cause of the short, since PPVRTC_G3H runs to the CPU as well?\n\nAny suggestions?"}
