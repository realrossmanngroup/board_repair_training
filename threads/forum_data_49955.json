        "A1534": "What is A1534? A1534 is a model number for a 12 inch size Macbook  from years 2015, 2016 with EMC 2746, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00045, 820-00244..",
        "U7800": "What is U7800? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",

        "PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS? This power rail is PPBUS_G3H after going through a current sense resistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H & the input of PPBUS_G3H to circuitry that provides power for the CPU..",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H? This is the input from the USB-C charger or the battery that is the input voltage for the chip responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H. It can be missing when capacitors on this line are shorted to ground, or when the diode in front of it leading to the chip that creates PP3V3_G3H is blown. .",
        "PP3V3R3V0_AON": "What is PP3V3R3V0_AON? PP3V3R3V0_AON is the first power rail you need to get a USB-C charger to go from 5v to 20v on an A1534 Macbook with an 820-00045 board..",

Pulled all 3 (<CAPACITOR>C0900</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C0901</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7880</CAPACITOR>) caps to confirm none were shorted and the short remained. I'm assuming <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> is specific to the board? Also the fact that the CPU is warm, is it possible that's it's the cause of the short, since <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> runs to the CPU as well?\n\nAny suggestions?"
