            "message": "Hey folks!\n\nThis is mostly a double-check before I call something prematurely.\n\nSystem is fully functional except for its internal display which has no image / no backlight.  Both.\n\n<SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is at 0V.  All supplies to <CHIP>U8500</CHIP>, <CHIP>U8501</CHIP>, and <CHIP>U8510</CHIP> are present.  \n\nSo either that signal is being shorted to ground by <CHIP>U8510</CHIP> - OR - after reading other posts it seems like the system may simply not be able to detect the internal display because I have 0.172V for all <SIGNAL>EDP_INT</SIGNAL> lines EXCEPT <SIGNAL>EDP_INT_AUX_N</SIGNAL>, which reads 0.001V.\n\nFrom [URL='https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00923</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-no-internal-video.62246/post-85930']this response by the great 2informaticos[/URL] I see someone with similar diode mode readings on a 2017 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, where with that low diode mode reading on <SIGNAL>EDP_INT_AUX_N</SIGNAL>, he calls time of death, saying that the CPU's eDP output is damaged because there are no series capacitors to protect data lines on that board, which is also the case on this one.\n\nThat's all there is to it, right? This is a desktop with a battery backup now?\n\nAgain, I'm pretty sure that that's all the case and I SUPER value your time, but I figure I owe my customer to double check in the interest of due diligence before failing to resolve something obvious, or offering a silly workaround for the customer if one might exist.\n\nI threw in as many keywords as I could so others can save everyone's time by not asking this in the future, eeeven just to double-check like me.  ;)  Hope that makes up for the potentially silly inquiry.\n\nThank you so much for your time!"

Besides the design flaw of a lack of a coupling cap to block DC from getting in there, that is.  \n\nIt really just has to have been some transient moisture or something that... maybe bridged the 3.3V line into the CPU across the <RESISTOR>R8503</RESISTOR> nostuff gap one, but then left no corrosion or residue to suggest such a thing?  Or a manufacturing defect in the CPU?\n\nWild speculation is wholly welcome.  ;)"
