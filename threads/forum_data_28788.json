        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U6901": "What is U6901? a CHIP.",
        "Q7035": "What is Q7035? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

        "C6990": "What is C6990? Capacitor to ground on input to PP3V42_G3H power supply. PP3V42_G3H power supply turns 18.5v from charger or 8.5v-12.5v PPBUS_G3H from the battery into PP3V42_G3H. This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger.",
        "R6905": "What is R6905? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on older Macbooks, pre-2011 models. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on.."
