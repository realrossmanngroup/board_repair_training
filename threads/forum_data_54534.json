Same happends with everything disconnected (bare motherboard only). Power board and flex cable are working ok with other boards, trackpad and keyboard are ok as well. Also it restarts if I try to open launchpad( tried with battery only, with unplugged battery or battery and charger connected). Fan starts to spin full speed after 1 min, facetime says that temperature is too high but HW monitor shows all temperatures are normal"
