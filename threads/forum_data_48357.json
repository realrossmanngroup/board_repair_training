Not sure if the battery is drained or something else.\nI don't have a spare battery to test with.\n\n20.4v going into the board from the genuine charger.\nPPBUS_G3H is boosting to 12.93v and then dropping to 3.4v repeatedly\ns5_pwrgd is boosting to 5.1v then drops to 3.2v and then drops to 0v.. it then starts over again.\n\nI get a fan twitch and the CPU is getting warm\n\nApologies if I should have given some basic info that I've missed in this initial post.\n\nAny help would be appreciated"
