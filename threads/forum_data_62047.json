Then suddenly stop charging and drained to 0%.\n\nWith the replaced battery still similar slow charging issues.\nGenuine 85W Charger, \"Genuine\"ish battery\n\niStats shows only 411mA charging current.\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"20211206_142313.jpg\"]60300[/ATTACH]\n\nLooking at DC-IN sensors seems to be pulling consistently 2-3.5A (adapter is capable of 4.6A and is getting noticeably hot)\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60301[/ATTACH]"
