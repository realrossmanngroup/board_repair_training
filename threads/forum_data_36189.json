Board came in badly liquid damaged replaced many components too this point. Original corrosion definitely around SMC reset IC and SMC as well as many other things. Board has now been ultrasoniced to rule out flux under SMC. PPBUS is 8.18 volts with a U5110 on the board and SMC Reset goes low. When I take it off, PPBUS goes back to 8.58, I get a light on the charger, and I get a quarter spin for the IC missing. So I thought ok bad IC from donor board. I have now tried 5 different ICs and I get the same issue 8.18 with the chip on and 8.58 with chip off. Is the SMC pulling it low with the IC on or do I seriously just have tons of bad SMC reset ICs from donors? Or could this be an internal board issue? I'm completely confused at this point for sure known good DC in board and flat cable and pullup for SMC_RESET_L measures 100K like it should. Any ideas?"}

Pin 4 should always come up to about 2.75V. \n\nOne way to bypass U5110 is to take it off the board. Then power up the board and manually short SMC_RESET to GND. This will give the SMC a known good start. PPBUS should then come up at 8.6V and board should start. Once that works we can worry about U5110 further."}
