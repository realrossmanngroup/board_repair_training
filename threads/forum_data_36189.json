        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",

            "message": "Ok so this one has me confused unless the SMC is causing this. Board came in badly liquid damaged replaced many components too this point. Original corrosion definitely around SMC reset IC and SMC as well as many other things. Board has now been ultrasoniced to rule out flux under SMC. PPBUS is 8.18 volts with a <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> on the board and SMC Reset goes low. When I take it off, PPBUS goes back to 8.58, I get a light on the charger, and I get a quarter spin for the IC missing. So I thought ok bad IC from donor board. I have now tried 5 different ICs and I get the same issue 8.18 with the chip on and 8.58 with chip off. Is the SMC pulling it low with the IC on or do I seriously just have tons of bad SMC reset ICs from donors? Or could this be an internal board issue? I'm completely confused at this point for sure known good DC in board and flat cable and pullup for <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> measures 100K like it should. Any ideas?"
