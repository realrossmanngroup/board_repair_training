I noticed because when i took out F3010,C3404,3201 and D3400, i still had short to ground. i write it jst in case it matters...i replaced U3200 with a brand new one. now i get 5v on both ports. top port, gets 5v and marks 0.07A and keeps ampmeter turned on. bottom port, marks 5v volts too, but draws 0.3A, but ampmeters keeps on resetting. when i tested with the top port i dont get PP3V3_G3H and PPBUS_G3H is 1.5v. with bottom port, i get a pulses on PP3V3_G3H and  5v pulses on PPBUS_G3H...moreover, bottom port works only on one side, if i turn the plug around it doesnt work. i guess the usb c port itself is corroded?"}
