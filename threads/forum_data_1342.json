Raise voltage 0.5v and keep it going until you figure it out.\n\nIs there no short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL>? If <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> dies, it can screw up <TRANSISTOR>Q7320</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7321</TRANSISTOR>. <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> tells <TRANSISTOR>Q7320</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7321</TRANSISTOR> when to turn on. If <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> is destroyed, it might just tell <TRANSISTOR>Q7320</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7321</TRANSISTOR> to always stay on, which burns them so they are always stuck on..which means they are always feeding <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> 8v.\n\nAND THE CYCLE CONTINUES! :(\n\nI would inject 1v and go from there. Pouring a layer of alcohol over the board makes this easier, wherever it fizzes, look there."
