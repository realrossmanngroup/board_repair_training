All I get is the blinking folder.\n\nThe SSD is fine, if I plug it in to my <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> MBP Retina it boots up no trouble (unfortunately I do not have access to the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> any more, as I traded off my last one)."

If SSD has High Sierra and the 3437 doesn't have the APFS (boot ROM ending in .B00) update, and the 00165 does, the 3437 won't \"see\" it.\n\nCheck pin out of SSD for 3437 vs. 00165; I feel like someone has asked this before and it did not work."

I should answer my own question and try it.\n\nI did ask a few weeks ago about a SSD from a system that -was- from a 3437 and showed up as a no-valid-partition crossed out circle on boot; that at least was a simple case of reinstall macOS and it was fine to use."
