        "message":"I got this A2159 820-01598, which have looping 5V 0.3A on the charger.\nU3200 shows a pulsing heat signature on both charging ports. While PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO is shorting. PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO shows 0.5Vdc.\n\nI don't see any liquid damage on the board itself, only the bottom of the battery sensors flipped red.\nI just got the chips today. Shall I replace U3200 first? If there is something else, I should check first to prevent shorting the replaced chip. Avoiding wasting chips, ubelievable how expensive these chips are for new macs?\n\nI can't detect any shorts on the major coils, CDxxx fuses, or bigger filtering caps.\n\nThanks"
