I crossed it using ebay to a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01598</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and found a copy of that but that was wrong.\n\nThe fault I think is a common one.   The 5v filter near the display plug melted down.   The 5v rail is now down and the camera no longer works.   I dug through the bone box \"not mine\" and found two more boards with this exact same problem.   \n\nI really need to trouble shoot this rail as it is down now.   So when  I fix the damage on the board there will be no power to that FET and passaves in the area anyway.  Also what is causing this on these boards?  What is the fix?  I am sure someone else as seen this!"

I am going to run a jumper.  I cannot find any reason for the failure.  There are no shorts.   So I am thinking it must be in the camera assembly not sure.\n\nIf anyone has some guidance that would be awesome."
