        "message":"Hi,\n\nI have that board which has the quarter fan spin. It has the normal sign of corrosion on the top edge of the board but looks quite good though.\nI have measured the voltage drop to ground on the S3 and S0 rails and have found a 0.115v drop ground on PP5V_S3 compared to a 0.425v drop to ground on a known working board.\nCan someone confirm this measurement?\n\nAlso, since it is not a complete short circuit, I have tried removing a few chips, like all the audio amps (U6610, U6620, U6630, U6201), some USB chips (U4800, U4600) but no cigar.\nI do not believe it has to be a caps, am I right to think that?\n\nHave anyone experienced that and could give me a hint?"
