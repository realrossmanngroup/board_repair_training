It will load mojave and big sur but has issues loaading monterey and ventura. I can boot them if drive is preloaded with ventura but it won't update and when trying to install monterey or  ventura it fails loading the update. I have it plugged into ethernet and connected to wifi.\n\nCan you do a clean ME on my bin file on google drive link below and\/or provide known good bios? It was too big to attach. \n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1HAjtoWvKu0ppXkb7kT4HIWq4BtozUKA5\/view?usp=sharing[\/URL]"}
