Was not starting. After UC starts when plugin in power supply.\n\nNow when I push pwr on keyboard it immediately resets smc (charger goes green and machine reboots). Also as soon as I put the test-probe on SMC_RESET_L it initiates the smc reset (goes green and reboots). SMC_RESET_L is 3.12V\n\nI changed U5110 and R5100 but still the same issue.\n\nWhat to do now ?"}

Pin 18 on J4800 is SMC reset line combined with the power switch. I say probably corrosion on the cable\/connector\/trackpad. In a rare case it could be the keyboard but then the left CRTL,ALT,SHIFT would also not function."}
