After UC starts when plugin in power supply.\n\nNow when I push pwr on keyboard it immediately resets smc (charger goes green and machine reboots). Also as soon as I put the test-probe on <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> it initiates the smc reset (goes green and reboots). <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is 3.12V\n\nI changed <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R5100</RESISTOR> but still the same issue.\n\nWhat to do now ?"
