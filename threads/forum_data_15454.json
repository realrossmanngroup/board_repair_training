Also checked all rails from and to the sensors, but as it shows errors from 9 sensors that are controlled by different parts, we are assuming it is something more central.\n\nSo we pulled the SMC, reballed it and soldered it back in. Still the same.\nSo we replaced the SMC from a donor board. Still the same.\n\nWe checked all rails between the SMC and around the sensors but still nothing.\n\nNow we had to return the board to the customer but he is really angry, as now the fans run on full speed all the time. Rest of the machine works flawlessly.\n\nAny ideas what we might have missed?\n\nThanks!"
