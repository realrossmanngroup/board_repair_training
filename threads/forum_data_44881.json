Older machine, very faint corrosion around the board, nothing major anywhere, especially along LCDBKLT circuit.\nJ9000\nPins 2,3=3.3V\nPins 38,39,40 (<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>) reads 25V. I believe this is supposed to be 50v for the 15\" \nAny idea what could cause the bklt to read low?\n\nThis is a mid 2012 model."
