            "message": "I've just had one of the above in.  bits of stray metal wire all over the motherboard (abortive hookup wires?) and many of the probe points are bright blue; some are purplish.  It looks like a huge current has passed through the board.\n\nno orange light, no green light no PPBUS.  \n\n<CHIP>U7100</CHIP> gets very hot.  When I removed it, many of the pads came with it (pin 9,10,11 and 15 - some others are dodgy too).  \n\nbut even with <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> removed there is still very low resistance on the pp1v05 circuit and the pp1v2 circuit\n\nno evident liquid damage on the board itself.  one component show arcing (<RESISTOR>R1270</RESISTOR>).  the backlight fuse has gone and <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> looked like all the balls on the edge side had fused.\n\nthe IO board does have signs of liquid damage but the components look ok if skanky; and it is sending the 15+V to the logic board.\n\nthis feels like it's going to be beyond profitable repair.  hooking up <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> is feasible (ish) but my concern is that with the liquid damage on the IO board and the arcing on the 1v+ lines, there could be much more that is dead.\n\nAnyone seen anything similar?  Feelings on being worth repair?\n\nthanks\nJustin"
