        "message":"Hi guys,\n\nA friend tried to upgrade to SSD and he did something that killed this mbp,\n\nI noticed that PP3V3_S5 was missing and that U7200 gets really hot. I replaced u7200 and it gets hot again. There seems to be no short on that line and diode mode at L7220 measures 0.089.\n\nIf I connect the magsafe and after U7200 gets hot (10-15 secs) this line gives a zero diode mode reading (magsafe disconnected of course).\n\nSince there is no apparent short injecting voltage would be pointless?? Any ideas?\n\nbr,\ngeorge"
