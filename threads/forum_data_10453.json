I replaced <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> and it gets hot again. There seems to be no short on that line and diode mode at L7220 measures 0.089.\n\nIf I connect the magsafe and after <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> gets hot (10-15 secs) this line gives a zero diode mode reading (magsafe disconnected of course).\n\nSince there is no apparent short injecting voltage would be pointless?? Any ideas?\n\nbr,\ngeorge"
