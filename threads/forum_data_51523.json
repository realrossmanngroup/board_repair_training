    "definitions": {
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL is another way to say SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL, look at the definition provided for SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL as it applies to .",
        "R6950": "What is R6950? a RESISTOR.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "R5280": "What is R5280? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. ."

No liquid damage and no one touch before me! \n\nAlready replace <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> for a new one but without changes! \n\nin osx i can see the icon of battery change some time. Some times i have a X and some times i get he thunder as it was charging! \n\nAnd in \"system report > Energy\" i have the message: Error on getting information. \n\nalready try a good Battery no hanges. \n\nIn diode mode on <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL</SIGNAL> - 0.461v \n                             <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA</SIGNAL>  - 0.461v\n\nany help with tis one? \n\nthanks"
