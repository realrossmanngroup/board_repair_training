Cleaned and still can't get <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. So no light on charger. After repairing <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> the charger is very dim for a second only. \nSo I tested for shorts on ppbus g3h. Can't find any. \nHave traced it back to <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, <SIGNAL>CHGR_CSO_P</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>CHGR_CSO_N</SIGNAL> are non existent.\n\nSo I have come to the conclusion that <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> is dead.

Really really wish I was in the states and could go sit with Louis or Jessa for however bloody long it takes..\n\nAnyway can I ask this then. At L7095 or even <CAPACITOR>C7095</CAPACITOR> I should be able to find me PP3V42. But I can't. I see 1.2v only.\n\n<CHIP>U7090</CHIP> is getting 16v on pin 6 VIN.\n<DIODE>D7005</DIODE> is showing 16v pin 2 and pin 3. Pin 1 is under 1v but that's because there is no battery??? (Praying I read that right)..\n\nso what im asking is could <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> be the culprit then?\n\nThanks duke. Any other subtle pointers you have would be highly appreciated!\nThanks."
