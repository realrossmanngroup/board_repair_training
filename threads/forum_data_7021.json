        "message":"[PLAIN][SOLVED]a1278 2012 820-3115 only runs with charger plugged in ,quarter fan spins with battery[\/PLAIN]\n\nHi guys,\nI have a liquid spilled 820-3115 board. the area around SMC got some spills, not severe though. ultrasonic cleaned then replace the cracking looking components.\nMachine can power on now and everything runs.\n\nHere is the probelm:\nThe machine only power on with charger is plugged in, it can't turn on when charger is disconnected. with battery fully charge and connected, when you try to turn on,it will be quarter fan spin.\nthe system can detect the battery and charges it.R5280 ,R5281 both have 3.3v on 2 pins of theirs.\nRan ADT got one error:4SNS\/1\/40000000:VC0C-3.196\nDid some research and say's it's CPU voltage sensor.\n\nnot sure if the CPU is related so I just point my finger to other signals. I checked SMC_BATLOW_L, when only battery plugged in, SMC_BATLOW_L is 0,so PM_BATLOW_L is 0 too.SMC_BATLOW_L comes from the SMC. and that means the SMC is bad? (I did a reflow on it but no change)\nwhen I press power button, both of the signal jumps to 3.3v then back to 0 along with the quarter fan\n\nmy thought is just kind of massive now and dont know where to go.any advice would be appreciaited!"

        "message":"check 17 18 of 7000,unfortunately,they are all good. damn, it's the POS SMC again, really a nightmare.\nthe thing is that all these SMC takes long time to replace and have no clues if the replacement IC is good until the whole process. 5 out of 10 of the donor boards won't work....that gotta be hours of works..\n\nis there any way we can modify the circuit and \"lie\" to the PCH and let it think there is battery plugged in? let's say jump a 3.3v from s5 rail to PM_BATLOW_L? so the PCH thinks it has battery plugged in?\nthen cut off the original SMC_BATLOW_L to PM_BATLOW_L trace?"
