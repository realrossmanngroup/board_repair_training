            "message": "Hi !\n\nI hate to work on this board, no fan spin = no fun. The board was liquid damaged, came here with no image. I refurbished the LCD connector that had minor corrosion and replaced the flex, LCD came back. When LCD went back, I discovered there was no KB no TP, the TP flex was damaged so I changed it too and now I have KB and TP, access to session and battery detection & charging.\n\nThe last problem is that the Mac is running really slow, I ultrasonic cleaned the board, no change. I tried with another battery and an other LCD, same thing. I found that <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is a bit higher as expected at 8.75V and it's probably a clue but I don't know how to interpret this.\n\nThank you for you help and ask me anything that I forgot on this description."

I don't have any SMC for this board to try right now, but if there is crap under the SMC maybe a reballing would be enough. Before, do you have a good board like this to compare some values on SMC and Power IC in diode mode ?"
