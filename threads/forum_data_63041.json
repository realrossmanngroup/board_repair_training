When we plug the DC cable with all connectors unplugged main board starts with 5V 0.200A then turns to 12.15V 0.00A and this jumps always between 0.000A and 0.100A. \n\nI have read all articles about this main board and checked J6100 rails to T2 chip on diode mode and found out no short but when I check the board under thermal camera while its starting i can see T2 chip flashes out but the temperature stays around 40C degrees \n\nI dont know where to start, could you please show me a way for this?"

When it flashes it went down to 0 and back to 0.1A again.  It starts with 5V then goes up to 12V but on 12V stays but it jumps down to 0.00 from 0.100A I ralised that on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> line it goes up to 3.3V but then jumps down to 0-1V then back to 3.3 again. And it loops like this. Nothing connected to the mainboard.\nAny suggestions?"
