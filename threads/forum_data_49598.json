Not posted for a while as I seem to be getting on OK with the logic board repairs. However, I think I am not seeing the wood for the tree's. I am searching around and losing track of what, where, why and when.\nMBA A1466 820-00165\nMagsafe- Green to Orange- no power on- no fan spin\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.597v\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.428v\nPP5V_S5 = 0V\nPP5V_S4RS3 = 0V\nPP5V_S0 = 0V\nPP3V3_S5 = 0.307V\nPP3V3_S4 = 0V\n\nBasically, all the 3v3 rails are 0v\n\nI have seen this issue addressed a few times on the forum and by our \"leader\" but for the life of me I can't seem to locate any of the videos or posts. I am probably not putting in the right search terms but being thick.. who knows.\n\nMy deduction, I believe there is an IC that produces both the 5v and the 3.3v.\n\nSearched over the board and so far, there was corrosion around pins 18 to 21 on U7501 so I removed and replaced it with another.\nCorrosion around pin 1 of R4411 and all 6 pins on Q4410. Q4410 was replaced. Pad on pin 1 of R4411 was gone so jumped to pin 1 on R4410.\nchecked rest of the board.... no corrosion. I don't think the board has been looked at before as even though it is cleaner that I would have thought as there was a little corrosion, there are loads of fibres on the board giving me reason to believe it has not been ultrasonic cleaned.\n\nPrior to disassembly, I did do a SMC reset and a PRAM reset. I have also tested SMC_RESET_L which gives 3.384v and SMC_MANUAL_RST_L gives 2.754v\n\nWhen the magsafe i connected the CPU does get warm. And even though I do not believe for one second it is a contributing factor, I have \"carefully\" removed J6100. I don't know why but Louis seems to have good results removing this.\n\nIs there anything else I should be checking, please?\nThank you in advance."}

I felt this was easier to locate than R1410. However, when I tested at Pin 2 of R1410 I was getting the same 0.036v but pin 1 is showing 3.334v. I removed this resistor and replaced it with another 10 kOhm resistor and now getting 3.330v on pin 2 and fan spin using both my 60w and 85w Magsafe 2 adapters.... no Magsafe 1 to 2 convertor as this sometimes gives problems. I am going to reassemble to see what happens from here and will report back\n\n[USER=\"1153\"]JohnB8812[\/USER] All of my adapters are genuine adapters. With exception of my 60w and 85w Magsafe 1's, which came from units that I brought in, my 45\/60\/85w Magsafe 2 and 30w USB C all came from my local Apple store at Lakeside Thurrock in Essex, UK.
