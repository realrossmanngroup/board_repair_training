I am searching around and losing track of what, where, why and when.\nMBA <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>\nMagsafe- Green to Orange- no power on- no fan spin\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 8.597v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.428v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> = 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> = 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> = 0.307V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> = 0V\n\nBasically, all the 3v3 rails are 0v\n\nI have seen this issue addressed a few times on the forum and by our \"leader\" but for the life of me I can't seem to locate any of the videos or posts. I am probably not putting in the right search terms but being thick.. who knows.\n\nMy deduction, I believe there is an IC that produces both the 5v and the 3.3v.\n\nSearched over the board and so far, there was corrosion around pins 18 to 21 on <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> so I removed and replaced it with another.\nCorrosion around pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R4411</RESISTOR> and all 6 pins on <TRANSISTOR>Q4410</TRANSISTOR>. <TRANSISTOR>Q4410</TRANSISTOR> was replaced. Pad on pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R4411</RESISTOR> was gone so jumped to pin 1 on <RESISTOR>R4410</RESISTOR>.\nchecked rest of the board.... no corrosion. I don't think the board has been looked at before as even though it is cleaner that I would have thought as there was a little corrosion, there are loads of fibres on the board giving me reason to believe it has not been ultrasonic cleaned.\n\nPrior to disassembly, I did do a SMC reset and a PRAM reset. I have also tested <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> which gives 3.384v and <SIGNAL>SMC_MANUAL_RST_L</SIGNAL> gives 2.754v\n\nWhen the magsafe i connected the CPU does get warm. And even though I do not believe for one second it is a contributing factor, I have \"carefully\" removed J6100. I don't know why but Louis seems to have good results removing this.\n\nIs there anything else I should be checking, please?\nThank you in advance."

For the record parts swapped were <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q4410</TRANSISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R4411</RESISTOR>. Pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R4411</RESISTOR> was also jumped to pin 1 on <RESISTOR>R4410</RESISTOR>. Finally <RESISTOR>R1410</RESISTOR> was replaced. I am going to soak test it for a couple of hours to make sure all is good. Thank you both for your assistance in helping me see the problems and resolving then. Kudos to you both."
