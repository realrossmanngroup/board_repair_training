        "message":"Hi there,\ngot a 820-01598 - did get it with some corrosion around U6903 (see picture) and at the Touch ID. After restoring it with Apple Configurator 2 it stucks (after the internet recovery screen) at this state. Already tried to restore it again - same result. Tried another touch ID, but still the same behavior? Fan behaves normally.\nAny ideas what could be the problem here? Faulty CPU?\nI'm not able to boot into the boot options menu or performing NVRAM reset - always directly boots into internet recovery mode. Keyboard is working since I'm able to type in my wifi password for internet connection.\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59876[\/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59877[\/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]59878[\/ATTACH]"
