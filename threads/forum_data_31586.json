        "message":"Hello guys! I have a water-damaged 820-3476 which only can work when the battery IS attached.\n\nHistory: All it could do before was a loud fan spin, nothing more. I cleaned the board, replaced some SMD's and ISL as well around that area. I found corrosion under U8030 and jumped pin2 to C8010. The board turning on and chime as well. Has no backlight and only working on battery. The main thing I want to repair on it is the power issue first.\n\nHere is the problem with:\n\nIt does NOT charging the battery, can read the cycle count, show proper percentage. I have green then orange led on the charger. If the battery is disconnected from the board, all it can do with original 60w\/85w adapter is turning on, chime then shut off. turning on again .. ... same cycle. I tried with other battery, charging port, have the same symptom.\n\nI'm not expert in board repair but I was able to solve some backlight, isl and other kind of problems before on other board but I'm stuck with this one.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any suggestion, help.\n\nSorry for the grammatical errors. :)"
