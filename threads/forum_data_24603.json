            "message": "This board had liquid damage only in one spot that I could find. <CAPACITOR>C7425</CAPACITOR> was the only component I could fine where there was any liquid damage. I removed that cap and I saw that the pad on Pin 2 was completely gone so I had to put the cap on pin 1 and put some solder onto the probe point next to it. Now the fan spins and the cpu gets warm but for some reason when I have the screen or something plugged in I will see the screen flash as if it turns on but then it will shut off and the fan stops spinning then it repeats over and over.\n\nWhen I have no external components plugged in the fan will spin for about 10 seconds then shut off and repeat again.\n\n<CAPACITOR>C7425</CAPACITOR> was surprisingly the only component that had any signs of liquid damage. I ultrasonic'd the board but still the issue remains.\n\nWhen I first received the board the fan would spin for 1 second then shut off and it does that also when I remove <CAPACITOR>C7425</CAPACITOR> from the board."
