        "message":"I have a 820-3662 that suffered liquid damage. The unit was badly liquid damaged in the eDP connector area, audio and thunderbolt. I removed the damaged components and soldered a new connector. The unit powers on a works fine except the fans always spin at max RPM but only after the OS is booted. (I tried known good OS as well) Ran ASD OS and the unit passes all test. I can't figure out what is causing the fans to ramp up. Any ideas ?"
