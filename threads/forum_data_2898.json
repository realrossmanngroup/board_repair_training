        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "R7100": "What is R7100? a RESISTOR.",
        "A1278": "What is A1278? A1278 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook or Macbook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2254, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2327, 820-2530, 820-2879, 820-2936, 820-3115..",

        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",

If it is stable on ONE part of the board, why is it not on another? If a signal that is present on one part of the board is not present on another, figure out why. You may have to run a jumper wire to make it present on another.\n\nMy guess is that your lack of green light is most likely fucked up flex cable to dc in board. if the flex cable was causing the short to ground it only makes sense that the dc in board is fucked. so, your homework IS\n\na) try a known good dc in board and flex cable\nb) check the pins on the dc in board connector ON THE LOGIC BOARD(not the dc in board) on the <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL>, and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> pins. Don't just look, poke them with a tweezer. If the pin moves, fix it.\nc) Tell me what <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> measures on the main logic board.\n\nand, for extra credit,\n\nd) Tell me what <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> measures on the known good DC in board you just plugged in.\ne) Tell me what <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> measures on the known good dc in board you just plugged in.\n\nNow I know what you might be thinking. There is no schematic or boardview for the dc in board. so how will I do this? Look at <CHIP>U6901</CHIP> & <CHIP>U6900</CHIP> on any <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> from 2009-2012... then look really hard on the DC in board of the air. Do you see anything that looks familiar ;)\n\nSometimes if I am dealing with an absolute doucherag that will not wait for me to buy the proper dc in board for an older air, I'll just fix their old one and run a bunch of wires from the main logic board to the dc in board. It works!\n\nHappy hunting"
