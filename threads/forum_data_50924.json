It appears to be working normally and passed ASD but when it starts up it doesn't do the fan up and down 3 times, it just spins up and works like a 2015. Any idea what might be happening?"

I'll just sell it as-is rather than spend the time swapping an SMC. For the record, it didn't have a lock. I had done a PRAM reset with no change. Once I have someone assemble it I'll have them do an SMC reset. Maybe that will help. Either way, thanks for the tips."
