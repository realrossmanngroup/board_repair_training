            "message": "Hi, having some Problems with this mid 09 board. It was at a different shop before as the backlight didn't work and they told the customer they couldn't fix it. I actually had a talk with that other place and they said they used freeze spray to find the issue causing the backlight issue and and that killed the board. Incredibly shady...\n\nWell anyway, the board did have some corrosion which could either be liquid damage or maybe from the freeze spray they used....\n\nThe board has a green light, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> but the S5 rails appear to already be missing. The main thing I noticed was <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> getting very hot. Already replaced it with another one thinking it might be bad but that didn't help...\n\n\nAnyone got a clue? I know these older boards aren't all that common for repair nowadays but maybe someone had an issue like this before..."
