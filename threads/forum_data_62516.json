Otherwise, it tries to power on, reaches 0.545 A, fan spin for a few seconds, but then powers off and stays at 0.030 A.\n\nIs this a known issue? Can you help?"}

After the replacement of R5177, the board started to power on, but on the first boot, it died on the Apple logo (the screen turned black), and now it seams that it powers on, but I have no image (internal or external).\n\nI have fan spin, voltages on all big coils, CPU gets hot, but I have no USB activity.\n\nI think that it might be a BIOS problem. Is there any way for me to confirm that, before desoldering it?"}
