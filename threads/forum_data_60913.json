            "message": "Hello to all,\n\nI have an old problem, but starting a new thread in order to present all relevant information for this particular macbook in one place.\n\nI have repaired the board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A, by replacing <CHIP>U8030</CHIP>. The laptop worked normally for a few hours and then fan just ramp to full speed.\nAt first I didn't notice any performance issue (YouTube, Netflix etc worked without glitches). Later I have found out that CPU speed is limited to max 1.0 GHz, but according to the specifications it is 1.6 GHz I5-5250U with Turbo boost up to 2.7 GHz, 4 GB RAM , 128 GB SSD.\n\nHWMonitor shows that 4 sensors are failed (actually 5, but \"meomory proximity doesn't exist in reality). Below keyboard cable is liquid presence indicator and it is white, meaning water wasn't there.\n\nWhat I have tried so far:\n1. disconnected web cam connector and issue is still there\n2. I have obtained new trackpad with new flex cable (actually used, but disassembled from working computer). I have connected the new trackpad, and issue still exists. This comes as a big surprise, because I expected problem would be solved with a new trackpad.\n\nSo, I need further advices. I believe that issue may be with <CHIP>U5810</CHIP>, if all those 4 sensors are connected to the same chip. According to the schematics (page nr. 44, this chip is for TBT, MLBBOT and TBD Temp Sensor)\n\nSo, I kindly somebody here, who have the same MBA with the same motherboard, is it possible to disconenct the trackpad. then starts laptop and post HWMonitor readings?\n\nHow to proceed further? Should I check if supply voltage is present on <CHIP>U5810</CHIP>? This chip is on the other side of the board and is not easy accessible.\n\nAny help is welcome, this problem is really a puzzle for me."

It was very unexected for me. Except for lack of audio, there were no other signs of additional slowdown. I expected very slow laptop. Since everything was the same (except audio and of course USB) this is indication to me that problem is more likely with flex and/or LIO board.\n\nAfter close examination of flex cable, I have found something, shown in the attachment. So my next suspect is flex cable. I have used alcohol and a toothbrush to clean connecter, but problem still exists. I have ordered and waiting for a new flex cable to check.\n\nSo it is possible that Palmrest sensor (and others) share the same interface as LIO board. I would never expected this based on the values from HWMonitor. But it is obvious there is some dirt on the flex cable. I never examine this before, since audio, USB and power was working fine. This cable is connected to J9500 connector on the mainboard."

Now, I examined the area around <CHIP>U5810</CHIP> more closely and found nothing suspicious, but when I measured the resistor <RESISTOR>R5811</RESISTOR>, which is 22 K according to the schematics the multimeter showed 4.5 kOhm in one direction and 3.5 kOhm in another (reverse MM plugs). I measured while component is still on the board, so it is not a 100% reliable measurement. Anyway, when connected to the charger, pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R5811</RESISTOR> (<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_TBTMLB_ISNS_R</SIGNAL>) was 3.28V, but pin 2 (<SIGNAL>TBT_INLET_THM_L</SIGNAL>) was 0.12V.\nNow, I know that _L means that signal is present when voltage is low, so I ask for your opinion whether this is OK. But on the other hand, maybe because this signal is low, this means that chip will consider this as a thermal issue present. Not sure how to interpret this. I would expect after 22 kOhm resistor to have voltage but don't know how big load <CHIP>U5810</CHIP> chip is."
