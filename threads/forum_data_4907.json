No screen on laptop and no trackpad but keyboard does smc resets. \nStarted measuring power rails, found <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> is only 1.5v wherever I measured. Obviously. \nEnded up at <RESISTOR>R7811</RESISTOR>, looked shit. Changed it. Laptop worked screen came on trackpad worked. Turned it off to put back together.\nThen upon reboot, same symptoms came back. Measured <RESISTOR>R7811</RESISTOR>, pin 1 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3_FET_R</SIGNAL> is 3.3v\nPin 2, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> is 1.5v instead of 3.3v\n\nI replace <RESISTOR>R7811</RESISTOR> again and still only 1.5v pin 2.\n\nWhat is it that I'm missing here, feel like it's blazingly obvious..\nThank you."

After looking at the schematic though and having fixed another one recently the same way I came to the conclusion to change the lcd cable on this one too. Low and behold problem solved. Second time an lcd cable has fixed something. \nReally confused still though how it kept burning <RESISTOR>R7811</RESISTOR>, I just don't get it. \nAnyway, I am thankful to you!"
