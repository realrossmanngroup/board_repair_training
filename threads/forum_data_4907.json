        "message":"Laptop would power on and got a screen on external monitor. No screen on laptop and no trackpad but keyboard does smc resets. \nStarted measuring power rails, found pp3v3_s3 is only 1.5v wherever I measured. Obviously. \nEnded up at R7811, looked shit. Changed it. Laptop worked screen came on trackpad worked. Turned it off to put back together.\nThen upon reboot, same symptoms came back. Measured R7811, pin 1 pp3v3_s3_fet_r is 3.3v\nPin 2, pp3v3_s3 is 1.5v instead of 3.3v\n\nI replace R7811 again and still only 1.5v pin 2.\n\nWhat is it that I'm missing here, feel like it's blazingly obvious..\nThank you."

After looking at the schematic though and having fixed another one recently the same way I came to the conclusion to change the lcd cable on this one too. Low and behold problem solved. Second time an lcd cable has fixed something. \nReally confused still though how it kept burning R7811, I just don't get it. \nAnyway, I am thankful to you!"
