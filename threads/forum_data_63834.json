        "message":"Hey guys,\n\nthe lid angle sensor is corroded. Disconnected the sensor - everything\u00b4s starting up and fine.\n\nIs there a fix without Apple? Can i move the chip (when its alive) to a new cable and everything\u00b4s works fine? Or it needs to be calibrated by Apple\u00b4s Software?\n\nThis awesome rocket-science sensor is paired to the board, right?\n\nWhat functionality is lost, when i just disconnect the cable? Can it be wake up and sleep manually?"
