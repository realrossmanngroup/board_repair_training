Can i move the chip (when its alive) to a new cable and everything´s works fine? Or it needs to be calibrated by Apple´s Software?\n\nThis awesome rocket-science sensor is paired to the board, right?\n\nWhat functionality is lost, when i just disconnect the cable? Can it be wake up and sleep manually?"
