So I injected 4.0V into G3H and see that <TRANSISTOR>Q7560</TRANSISTOR> go hot. Changed it and only got 0.5V on G3H. Found F7140 was no good. Changed it and when I plugged in DC power <TRANSISTOR>Q7560</TRANSISTOR> started to smoke. I see <TRANSISTOR>Q7560</TRANSISTOR> does go to ground, so it is shorting to ground. When it was removed I did a continuity check on the pins with ground and none of them beeped. Like standing in a crossroad and saying DF?!"
