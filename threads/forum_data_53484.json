        "message":"I have a weird one. This one shows a full short on PPbus_g3h while simultaneously showing 8.6V. How is that possible?\nI've triple checked this, am I going crazy?\n\nSigns of water on the underside of the board. there was corrosion around u3210, u3220 and u7101. I've rebuilt those areas and they look great now. Also has backlight when it does power on. When it's on it recognises and charges the battery\n\nWhen the machine decides to play dead, SMC bypass will just turn on the fan, then back off and it'll repeat this over and over. This indicates ISL 6259 to me but I have checked resistance on pins 17\/18 = 4 ohms and 27\/28 = 20ohms.\n\nWhen the macbook is fully funnctional, everything works. no loud fan spin etc so good sensors"
