The original board was so bad that I decided to replace it with one from a cracked screen MBP. This new board seems all fine but boots into a folder icon. The mac passes the hardware test with no isssues. When booting into recovery the SSD shows up along with one partition in gray that will not mount. Any ideas what this is about? Below is a picture."}

Install Mojave on another SSD and it will update, then put back the original SSD."}
