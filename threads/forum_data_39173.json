I took this to be the graphics chip problem,\nsince I am new and need practice I took the heat shield off, cleaned all the old paste off both the cpu and gpu, practiced\nusing my quick on the amd chip, I can't think I did it long enough to melt any solder but let cool, re-pasted the two\nchips, put the heat sink back on and it boots fine, lines in screen are gone and no longer hot, has been running about\nan hour..\n\nSo my question is, is this only temporary and the issues will return?"}
