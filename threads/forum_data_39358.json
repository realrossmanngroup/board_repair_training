No I have a green which now turns to orange light but still not powering on and nothing warms up either.\n[TABLE=\"border: 0, cellpadding: 0, cellspacing: 0\"]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"width: 220\"]<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"width: 147\"]12.56V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]16.41V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]3.42V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3J</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]3.42V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]1.7001V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]3.29V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nI'm basically getting no 5V (besides 1.7 on S5) and no 3V3 RailsThese are some of my readings and I have checked all the rails but nothing else looks damaged and not sure where to go from here.\n\nMany thanks for any help.\nSam"
