            "message": "Hello. Got this board here and it was not turning on, shorted <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> line, which I traced to bad <CHIP>U7330</CHIP>, which I replaced. Board worked perfectly yesterday after the replacement of that chip, I turned off the machine and left it sitting on the bench to finish assembling today. Today, when I arrived at my workshop the machine was turning on but giving no POST. After some inspection I detected CPU VCORE was not present and I have now a full short on L7330/20/10. I thought maybe <CHIP>U7330</CHIP> was bad again and removed it, short persisted. So I removed <RESISTOR>R7330</RESISTOR>/20/10 to see on what side the short is, and for my bad luck, it's on CPU side. Tried injecting voltage, it sucks 5A from my bench PSU(maximum it can provide) but nothing gets even a little warm to touch. Any ideas?"
