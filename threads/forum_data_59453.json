    "definitions": {
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the backlight on the LCD screen, this is necessary to get the screen to light up..",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_DIV_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_DIV_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "LCDBKLT_BOOST": "What is LCDBKLT_BOOST? LCDBKLT_BOOST is connected to the SWITCH(SW) pin of the LED driver and is switched to ground quickly after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit that boosts PPBUS_G3H to backlight voltage for the screen. .",
        "5V_S0": "What is 5V_S0? 5V_S5 is an abbreviation for “PP5V_S0”."
