After the progress bar gets about 1\/2 way the system will automatically go into hibernate.\n\nAfter it\u2019s turned back on from hibernate it will stay on for only a few minutes before going into hibernate again. Also even with the battery disconnected at times it will show 100% in the progress bar and in the power section show about 14,000 cycles??\n\nThe glass is cracked on the screen but the LCD is still good. Any ideas on this one?"}
