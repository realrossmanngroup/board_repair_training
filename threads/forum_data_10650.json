        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "PP5V_SUS": "What is PP5V_SUS? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
        "ALL_SYS": "What is ALL_SYS? This is a typo of ALL_SYS_PWRGD When you see ALL_SYS, assume they meant to type ALL_SYS_PWRGD.",
        "U7200": "What is U7200? a CHIP.",
        "C7860": "What is C7860? a CAPACITOR.",
        "P3V3S5_EN_L": "What is P3V3S5_EN_L? P3V3S5_EN_L is a signal that enables the power chip responsible for creating PP3V3_S5 when it is low. .",
        "P3V3S5_ENTRIP": "What is P3V3S5_ENTRIP? a SIGNAL.",

        "820-2327": "What is 820-2327? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "TPS51125": "What is TPS51125? This is a power chip responsible for the PP3V3_S5,  PP5V_S5,  and PP5V_S3 power rails on many A1278 model Macbooks."

A short to ground is extremely low resistance to ground so all power gets shunned to ground. Does 14.67 kiloohms sound like a short to ground, or a high resistance? There is nothing wrong with <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>.\n\n[QUOTE=\"menatwork, post: 10825\"]Just replaced <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> and i dont get FAN.[/QUOTE]\n\nThis was turning on and off - <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> was working. You replaced it, and it doesn't work. This means <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> was fine before, but is not fine now. The only logical conclusion we can come to is that you took a board that was most likely not fixable and made it even more broken - which means we are getting nowhere.\n\n\n[QUOTE=\"menatwork, post: 10913\"]We are here for what?\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\nThe idea with this forum is that we give you ideas when we can, and you run with it. Most will run with it, learn as they go, and get things working again. Some will not. Pattern recognition and learning from mistakes as we go is the most important thing in this business.\n\nWe're over eight months into this and you're calling 14,000+ ohms a short to ground. So we think to ourselves, [I]\"if we keep providing help, will he learn?\" [/I]and the answer becomes [I]\"probably not - he still doesn't understand the idea of a short circuit to ground or resistance measurements.\"[/I] Then the question is asked, [I]\"have you explained this to him before?\" [/I]and the answer is \"yes\". Then we have posts like [URL=\"https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/6067-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-works-but\"]here[/URL] where you say you have backlight, then post a value for pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> that makes it impossible for backlight to exist. We have posts where you've [URL=\"https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/7003-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-b-no-pp5v\"]told us you were troubleshooting one board when you were troubleshooting another[/URL], when the boards in question share no physical likeness. We [URL=\"https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/6648-solved-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-f6905\"]ask you if there is a short to ground and you replace a resistor instead[/URL]. Here you told us [URL=\"https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/7350-%E2%80%8B-solved-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2327</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-old-board\"]you didn't have 3v when you did have 3v.[/URL]. Here you [URL=\"https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/6067-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-works-but/page3\"]proposed an impossible scenario where there was 16v on the pp3v42 input, no pp3v42, but pp3v42 from a battery on a board that was turning on and booting earlier in the thread.[/URL]\n\nIf we can't trust your measurements, can't trust your soldering, can't trust that you're learning from our posts, and can't trust that you'll answer the question asked, this all becomes completely hopeless. We aren't hiding magical solutions from you because we're miserable pricks. We need to work with you to make these work again. We can't do the soldering and measuring for you, and we can't see the boards. That part we must trust you do properly on your end. Time and time again this is something that we can't trust you with, and if we can't trust you to do your part, then there's no help we can provide.\n\nDuke is the best you'll ever find at blind troubleshooting these boards blind over the internet, and this is him at the end of his rope at realizing that you aren't getting it. Honestly, at this point, this forum is probably not the best place for you to continue with troubleshooting, but I don't know where else you'll receive anything close to what he's offering.\n\nAt this point, you can either choose to try and improve in the areas you're not excelling at, or give up, but given the current course there really isn't anything else we can do to help you here. Ask questions like is 14kohms a short to ground, or high resistance? If this is not a short to ground, why am I replacing a working chip? Why is the chip that worked before dead now?"

            "message": "Hey Menatwork,\nI rarely fix MacBooks but I'll give you some advice anyway.\n1.) Not all boards are repairable. Accept that.\n\n2.) You can't make a hard board easy. Just because you are familiar with one problem doesn't make the board in front of you have that problem.\n\n3.) When a mentor tells you that a hard board is not repairable there is no amount of \"what do I test next?\" That will turn it into a repairable board.\n\n4). It is entirely possible to inspire a mentor to become personally invested in your success. This does not happen by paying a few bucks for forum membership a month. It happens by asking thoughtful questions that show you are learning. It happens when you show what you learned from a stupid mistake. It happens when you ask questions that the mentor can see themselves asking when they were in your shoes. Mentors are people, and can get frustrated when they do invest in helping someone and see that their words fell on deaf ears, or entitled ears, or the ears of someone with not enough core analytical reasoning to succeed. Learn how to inspire mentors to help you.\n\nWith the relatively small amount of Macbook knowledge that I have, this is what your repair looks like to me.\n\nIt sounds like you had ppbusg3h, which means you would have to have pp3v42. Your problem here is beyond this.\n\nYou provided a few measurements and were told that the board is not repairable but you didn't accept that.\n\nYou tried to make a hard board easy by blindly applying irrelevant solutions that will solve easy boards. <CHIP>TPS51125</CHIP> chip problems are common on easy boards so you changed the <CHIP>TPS51125</CHIP> chip. And the minimal function the board did have was lost--meaning that you must have replaced it not only in vain but poorly.\n\nThen it seems like you went on to misdiagnose a short. Then you showed a fundamental lack of understanding what a short is by trying to solve your \"short\" by replacing s component that has no path to ground.\n\nhow maddening it must be to watch you make these fundamental mistakes for anyone with even the most modest investment in your success.\n\nSo what to do now?\n\nYou need some redemption, son! Your next step is to redeem yourself in the eyes of your mentors by doing the following:\n\nTell them exactly why there was zero chance that the <CHIP>TPS51125</CHIP> chip had anything to do with the problem this board has.\n\nTell them what a short is, how you would measure it, and if a line is short--what kinds of components could potentially be the cause of the short to ground and which ones could never be the cause of a short to ground.\n\nI'll get you started. When I have a line with a short to ground, and there is an inductor coil on that line, the coil is:\nA) sometimes the cause of a short to ground or\nB) it's never the coil\n\ngood luck!"
