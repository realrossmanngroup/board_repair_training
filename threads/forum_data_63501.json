Board was clean. <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2159</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01598</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that has no wifi for no known/visible reasons. 1.8V and 3v3 are present so I believed it was the wifi chip itself. I tried reballing it but no change. I tried pulling same part number wifi chip from other board with associated ROM chips and no change. I then ordered a <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2159</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> donor board to see if it was related to prior attempt being from a different model. Pulled Wifi and WLAN and BT roms from 01598 donor and no change. I tried restoring from DFU to see if maybe T2 needed reflash and no change.\n\nBroken trace wouldn't make sense to me. I'm thinking there's a weak link. Suggestions?"
