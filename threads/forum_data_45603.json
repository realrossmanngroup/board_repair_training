        "message":"Hi,\nI have this 820-2879-B that comes on macbook pro initially seems to freeze randomly. i thought was a RAM problem: changed with (2x8GB) DDR3 PC3-8500 1066MHz and started to work normally since, during a firmware upgrade, the macbook freeze. EFI Chip damaged: SOS Beeps. Changed Chip and now sometimes it beeps single one with 5sec pause, sometimes boot on system freezing after few seconds, sometimes -when i try to attempt to boot in recovery- it freeze on Wifi selection and the screen goes in semi-dim complete gray. I have also rebend two ethernet pins were shorted together. I hope in some help, and I hope is not GPU or CPU related.\nThanks!"
