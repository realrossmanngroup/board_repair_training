        "820-00165A": "What is 820-00165A? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CPU_THRMTRIP_3V3": "What is CPU_THRMTRIP_3V3? a SIGNAL.",
        "R5117": "What is R5117? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q5158": "What is Q5158? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "R7789": "What is R7789? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7788": "What is R7788? a RESISTOR.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
