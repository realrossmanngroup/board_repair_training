I replaced one of the CD32 chips as nothing was coming up on amp meter on that one port. then i got the 5V back on that port. Just in case replaced both of them in case one was causing the no 20V\n\nscanned the board and saw that <CHIP>U8210</CHIP> was fried, replaced that\nthen i did some more checking and realised f6700 was blown too so replaced that as well. still no difference \n\nI then saw that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3S</SIGNAL> was only 10ohms from to ground. I injected 3V and saw that <CHIP>U8210</CHIP> was lit up on thermal. removed that but still had 500ma short on that line. I then saw that there's a small amount of heat coming from under WIFI chip \n\nthis board is a nightmare..."
