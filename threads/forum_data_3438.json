I have also tested it with different batteries, same result.\n\nThe board looks very good, has no burnt part, it went through a light water damage. \n\nThanks."}

There is no reason this shouldn't work. If you power on with AC+BATT and then remove AC it shuts down? The system should remain under power through the diode in Q7155 even if Q7155 is not switched on."}
