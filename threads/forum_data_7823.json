        "message":"So I'm back with weird mbp. So when i got this machine the lvds connector pins were smashed and the solder was touching, other than that everything seemed to work except the screen had a green tint to it. I tried 3 different and known good screens and lvds cables all of which do something different with the video out. was thinking this was a bad lvds connector, so i changed it out to only discover the issue is still the same. Ive ran ASD 3S144 it passes everything. on external the video is perfect.\n\nNot really sure where to go on this now. Any ideas?"
