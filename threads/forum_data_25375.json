Here is the link to it \n[url]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/25072-solved-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2530</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-no-green-light-or-s3-s0-rails[/url]\n\nIts been a few days because I had to order another dc-in board for this since my test one doesn't look that great even though it works fine. I put 2 different dc-in boards and put the board in the housing plugged in the battery and everything. When I hit the power button the fans spin but I got no video or chime.\n\nI checked and there was 0v on Pin 1 of <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> so no screen is detected.  I even plugged in another known working screen and that didn't work either. \nHere are some measurments I got and things I've tried doing to fix this.\nCPU Vcore - 1.15v\n<CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR> voltage - 1.06v\nResistance to ground on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 5.4kohms (Dead MCP??? What could cause it to die so soon after working - I tried heating MCP then turning on but that didn't work.)\nSMC/PRAM reset\nRemoved Ram sticks and got beeps\nUSB Mouse lights up\nThe DC-IN connector didn't look to great on the <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> pin. I've tried removing Dc-in board and plugging battery in and turning on with keyboard but that still didn't work."
