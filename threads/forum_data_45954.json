There was a short on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, which was a short internally in the ISL. Replaced the ISL and the system booted.\nBut now it doesn't run on battery, and the system doesn't recognized a battery. The battery that was present was at 0V, so completely dead. Replaced with a known working battery, but still doen't see the battery.\n\nWith just the battery connected I am getting <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, but nothing else. \n\nOn the battery connector (J6950) I am getting 3.42V on <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SCL</SIGNAL> (pin 4) and <SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_L</SIGNAL> (pin 5), but 0V on <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA</SIGNAL> (pin 6).\nSo the clock for communication is likely present, but doesn't want to talk. Not sure what <SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_L</SIGNAL> does, since is just seem to be a dud.\n\nSince the ISL was shorted and likely drained the battery completely there might have been 10.5V on the <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA</SIGNAL>, and damaging the SMC. I measured the <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA</SIGNAL> line form <CHIP>U6950</CHIP> to the ISL, which is not broken. <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA</SIGNAL> measures 0.480V to ground in diode mode, so seems there is no short.\n\nJust to be sure I had a good ISL, I replaced it by another new one, same issue.\n\nAre there anymore things I can try before concluding the SMC is \"dead\"?"
