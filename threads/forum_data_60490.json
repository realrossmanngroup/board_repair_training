        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN": "What is SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "U5000": "What is U5000? This is the System Management Controller(SMC) in macbooks from 2013-2015.",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC": "What is PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC? PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC Is a reference voltage for the SMCâ€™s voltage sensors & other sensors..",
