        "message":"I have this board, customer said it wasn't getting image to the display but did get image on external display. Once i started working on it, i noticed there was no usb-c activity on any of the port, which also meant no external display image. Started probing and noticed L7410 and L7421 (PPVCCGT_S0_CPU) were reading 0v. \n\nSignals to U7410\/U7420\nPP5V_S0 - 5v\nPPBUS_HS_CPU - 12.6\nCPUGT_FCCM - 0.015\nCPUGT_PWM1 - 2.57\nCPUGT_PWM2 - 2.58\n\ncurrent pull by the board swings inconsistently between 1.20 and .91A\n\nAny suggestions?"
