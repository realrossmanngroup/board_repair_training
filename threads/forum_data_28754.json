            "message": "Hey \n\nDuke can you explain what (rail) got fucked up here?\n\nComputer came in with mouse and keyboard freezing 2 seconds after OS loads (but working fine in boot manager)\n\nIt came form an AASP who had told the customer it was a Logic Board issue. I then put a known good Logic Board into the casing to test. Error remains... So it is a \"casing issue\". Fine I then replace the top case as I think it is probably the trackpad/cable. Error remains... I then tested with another display assembly and the freezing stops. I ended up just replacing the LCD-cable.\n\nBut I keep wondering what could make this issue - I have never seen a defective LCD-cable make the trackpad and keyboard unresponsive.\n\nThanks"
