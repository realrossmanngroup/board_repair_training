The data is not important for the customer. I can order  a second-hand on ebay for 150usd."

Underfill combined with no schematics is making is really hard to figure out what's wrong.\n\nPretty sure the moment schematics for this ever end up online the market is going to be flooded with refurbished/fixed SSDs :D"
