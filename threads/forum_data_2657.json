        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",

I have Green Light, S5 state, <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>RSMRST_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL> all in their correct voltages, and I've tried going in with refit and smcflasher in an efi shell, but it won't let me '-reset 1' or flash firmware on, also says it's in U mode not AppCode mode. Should I just conclude that the SMC is fucked and move on with my life? Or am I missing something.\n\nFun fact, I got a donor board hoping to use the SMC off of that, and it has the exact same issue.
