I have Green Light, S5 state, SMC_ONOFF_L, RSMRST_PWRGD, PM_PWRBTN_L, PM_SLP_S4_L, PM_SLP_S5_L and PM_RSMRST_L all in their correct voltages, and I've tried going in with refit and smcflasher in an efi shell, but it won't let me '-reset 1' or flash firmware on, also says it's in U mode not AppCode mode. Should I just conclude that the SMC is fucked and move on with my life? Or am I missing something.\n\nFun fact, I got a donor board hoping to use the SMC off of that, and it has the exact same issue. FML :confused:"
