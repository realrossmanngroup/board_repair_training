Believe prior person may have cleaned because I cannot find any corrosion.\n\nMacBook powers up to flashing folder and within 10 seconds it reboots. Using genuine charger. Any suggestions on where to start?"}

I'm well aware what a flashing folder means. I do not have a drive installed. The issue is the computer will power down by itself and then back on every 10 seconds or so.\n\nIm led to believe it may be an issue with the u7100 area. Specifically the sense resistors.\n\nI did find that R7110 is reading out at 53k and according to schematics it should be 68.1k. Would this create this issue?"}
