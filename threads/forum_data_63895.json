I cleaned the liquid damage and replaced a bunch of corroded caps and resistors. I get 20v and the board turns on and boots to the OS when using any of the ports on the left side of the mac, but the port on the right side for UG400 only gives me 5v 20ma. I checked diode mode values on all the resistors and caps around UG400 and they all seem to match with a good board. Not sure where to look next.\n\nWith charger connected to UG400:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVBUS_USBC2</SIGNAL> - 5v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_LDO</SIGNAL> - 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_UPC2_LDO_CORE</SIGNAL> - 1.5v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> - 0.748v\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_AON</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL> - 0v"
