        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",

        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the backlight on the LCD screen, this is necessary to get the screen to light up..",
        "LCDBKLT_BOOST": "What is LCDBKLT_BOOST? LCDBKLT_BOOST is connected to the SWITCH(SW) pin of the LED driver and is switched to ground quickly after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit that boosts PPBUS_G3H to backlight voltage for the screen. .",

        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

It got 3 pads (Pin2 NC, Pin3/4 <SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>) missing on the lcd connector. I already [/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR][COLOR=#333333][FONT=Verdana][SIZE=13px]ran a wire from pin 3&4 of the LVDS connector to pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C8317</CAPACITOR> but i still don't have a backlight. My output voltage at <SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> is 8.42v. According to Louis sticky post this might be related to <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> not boosting the backlight. I proceeded with troubleshooting this area since the problem is most likely on this circuitry. My readings on <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> are the following: <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> 1.46v, <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> 1.38v, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> 5.09v, <SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_BOOST</SIGNAL> 8.55v, <SIGNAL>PPHVS0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> 8.40v. Should my voltages on <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> & <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> be higher? Do you think my <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> is no good?\n\nThanks![/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR]"

I just had a few questions.  I didn't know the 2010 model connector wasn't compatible with this model. I thought they were all the same. Maybe thats my issue. I guess Im better off answerign my own questions. Thanks for the answer lool"

I had to reinstall the correct LVDS connector and make a jumper from the bottom of the board to the top to fix the blown trace. This was a awesome repair. It taught me a lot of things.
