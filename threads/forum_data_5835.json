        "message":"[COLOR=#333333][FONT=Verdana][SIZE=13px]Hello everyone, [\/SIZE][\/FONT][\/COLOR][COLOR=#333333][FONT=Verdana][SIZE=13px]I'm working on a liquid damage macbook air 820-3437b. It got 3 pads (Pin2 NC, Pin3\/4 PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT) missing on the lcd connector. I already [\/SIZE][\/FONT][\/COLOR][COLOR=#333333][FONT=Verdana][SIZE=13px]ran a wire from pin 3&4 of the LVDS connector to pin 1 of c8317 but i still don't have a backlight. My output voltage at PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is 8.42v. According to Louis sticky post this might be related to U7701 not boosting the backlight. I proceeded with troubleshooting this area since the problem is most likely on this circuitry. My readings on u7701 are the following: BKL_PWM 1.46v, BKL_EN 1.38v, PP5V_S0 5.09v, LCDBKLT_BOOST 8.55v, PPHVS0SW_LCDBKLT 8.40v. Should my voltages on BKL_PWM & BKL_EN be higher? Do you think my U7701 is no good?\n\nThanks![\/SIZE][\/FONT][\/COLOR]"

I didn't know the 2010 model connector wasn't compatible with this model. I thought they were all the same. Maybe thats my issue. I guess Im better off answerign my own questions. Thanks for the answer lool"

I had to reinstall the correct LVDS connector and make a jumper from the bottom of the board to the top to fix the blown trace. This was a awesome repair. It taught me a lot of things. Thanks for all the help!!"
