No water damage as far as I can see. <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> measures 0.007V in diode mode or 18 Ohms. \n\nI've removed L6995 to see which side is shorted - system side it is. \n\nI've injected 1V into the <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and the current draw was around 600mA, pointing at <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, which was removed after. \n\nNow with 1V injected the current draw is around 65mA and SMC gets barely warm. I don't see anything else on camera. \n\nWhat should be my next step?"
