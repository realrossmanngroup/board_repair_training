This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

            "message": "A water damaged logic board. Cleaned up and replaced quite a few parts. However, eventually hit this issue.\n\nUpon applying power to the board, after about 1 second, <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> gets extremely hot. There is no short to ground on either side of the resistor and each side reads 60-70K to the ground. Resistor itself is fine at 47ohm. <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> are fine, so does <CAPACITOR>C7092</CAPACITOR>, 91, 90. \n\nThe part I get confused is that ping 2 of the resistor reads 16.5V, and pin 1 ready 3.3v ! Pin 1 connects to DCIN ISOL BLEEDER circuit on the upper part of page 51. What does this circuit do ? Mosfet <TRANSISTOR>Q7010</TRANSISTOR> was warming up a bit (with no shorts), replaced it just in case but made no difference. <TRANSISTOR>Q7020</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> are not installed, adding more to the confusion. \n\nHow can I figure out the source of the over current going through <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> ?\n\nThanks"
