        "R7050": "What is R7050? Current sense shunt resistor for the battery, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 17/18 on ISL6259 should give you 2.02 ohms. .",
        "R7052": "What is R7052? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging.."

Found that a trace was missing from <RESISTOR>R7052</RESISTOR> (2) to <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> (4) so I put a jumper in it, did that, but still not turning on, when I turn it on with my PSU sometimes I get <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> at 12.6v  @.020A and sometimes I get <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> at 4.99V @.080A. Have replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, same behavior.\nThere is a weird thing, on <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> pin 6, I get .850v and I think I am supposed to get 3.3v there am I right? Anyway, when the board is at .080A there is no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. but when it is at .020A I do get the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> line.\n<CHIP>U7941</CHIP>\nPIN 1-3 = 3.3V\nPIN 4 = 0V\nPIN 5 = 0V\nPIN 6 = 3.3V\nPIN 7 = 0V\nPIN 8 = 3.3V\n\nANOTHER WEIRD THING, WHEN I TURN OFF MY PSU IF I MEASURE PIN 2 OF F7040 VOLTAGE IS NOT 0V IT IS AROUND 3V AND DROPPING..."
