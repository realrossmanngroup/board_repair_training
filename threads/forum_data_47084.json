The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

            "message": "Hi, This touchbar macbook originally had liquid damage only around the <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> area. I had to run a couple wires on a resistor and capacitor due to the pads being gone on them. After that the machine turned on and everything worked fine. I sent it back to the customer and now they sent it back to me since it is showing a questionmark folder and now I don't feel the trackpad clicking and even if I hold the option key on startup nothing happens.\nThis isn't the first time I've fixed a machine that had liquid damage around a USB-C controller chip only to have it return back a few weeks later for a questionmark folder appearing but this one doesn't make sense to me because the only liquid damage was on the opposite side of where the SSD controller chip is.\n\nHere are some measurements around the TPAD area that I took to find out why it's not clicking.\nF4500 - 13v on both sides.\nL4500 - 5v on both sides\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4_TPAD</SIGNAL> - 0.08v"
