            "message": "Got this board that had heavy corrosion damage on and around the backlight circuit. Found blow cap <CAPACITOR>C8467</CAPACITOR> and also had to replace <RESISTOR>R8446</RESISTOR> as pin 2 of the resistor along with the pad was corroded. Due to <RESISTOR>R8446</RESISTOR> solder pads being damaged, i soldered it to <CAPACITOR>C8457</CAPACITOR> and ran a line from pin 2 of the resistor to J8401, pins 1 and 2. The laptop powers up and works except when powered down, the keyboard backlight goes off as expected, but then after about a second or two, the keyboard backlight comes back on and stays on. \n\nWhen OS is loaded, the keyboard backlight doesn't respond when i attempt to increase or decrease, it remains on at full intensity. \n\nAny suggestions"

But i still don't have control of the keyboard backlight once powered up. it remains at full brightness. Took the measurement as requested and here's the values\n\npins 1 goes from 1.15 to 1.3 when i increase the backlight intensity from 0 to max. Pin 4 never changes, remains at 3.3v. Should the output of this chip modulate as the input or is it a fixed 0 or 3.3v gate output."
