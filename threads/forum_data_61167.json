Found blow cap C8467 and also had to replace R8446 as pin 2 of the resistor along with the pad was corroded. Due to R8446 solder pads being damaged, i soldered it to C8457 and ran a line from pin 2 of the resistor to J8401, pins 1 and 2. The laptop powers up and works except when powered down, the keyboard backlight goes off as expected, but then after about a second or two, the keyboard backlight comes back on and stays on. \n\nWhen OS is loaded, the keyboard backlight doesn't respond when i attempt to increase or decrease, it remains on at full intensity. \n\nAny suggestions"}

But i still don't have control of the keyboard backlight once powered up. it remains at full brightness. Took the measurement as requested and here's the values\n\npins 1 goes from 1.15 to 1.3 when i increase the backlight intensity from 0 to max. Pin 4 never changes, remains at 3.3v. Should the output of this chip modulate as the input or is it a fixed 0 or 3.3v gate output."}
