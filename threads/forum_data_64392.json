I found oxidation in the oxidation on R1663\/62\/66\/26. I replaced them all and it didn't work. Checking the voltages, I noticed problems with the SMC. Replaced it and the mac turned on, worked perfect for two days and stopped.\n\nSMC bypass did not work.\n\nPPBus is 8.6v\nSMC_reset - 3.3v\nSMC_onoff - 3.3v\nPLT_reset - 0v\nSMC_PM_G2_EN - 3.3v\nSMC_adapter_en - 0v\n\nWill there be a problem with the SMC again?"}
