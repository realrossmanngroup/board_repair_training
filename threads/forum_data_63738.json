Client bought new display and mounted it, internal still doesnt work.\n\nComponent im pointing to in image has been ripped off and 2 pins in cpu socket were bent. The pins have been bent back.\n\nWondering if the component in question is vital or the cause would be something else, im suspecting the display issue is not because of this.\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]61085[\/ATTACH]"
