I've got 5 in test cases that I've been trying to force to fail, and of course now that I need them to do so, they won't. :( I don't have time to use each one for an hour or two and get them to crash, far too much work that needs to be done. If anyone can come up with a good way to force them to crash, let us know. So far the easiest way I've found is to run the boards hard, then put them to sleep overnight. About half the time they'll crash during sleep. I'm not 100% sure if it's the same issue, as Duke mentioned that if they crash during sleep, they technically may not be going into full sleep. No clue at this point."}

My prediction is that 2015 models will also start getting the same issues as the 2014.\n\nI have ordered some CPU FETs to see if that will make any difference. Pulling them from dead boards has not been a good idea to eliminate them as those could also have been flaky."}

I've replaced them on 3 boards so far and no issues, but again, I'm not sure how best to test them. Maybe just sell them and let the customers be the testers, lol. \n\nI've had the 3 units running for 4 days now; I've tested them in spurts, but they've all passed my \"sleep\" test, where they don't crash overnight or during long sleep durations anymore. I might just go ahead and sell them and see if they come back...small price to pay to have someone test them in real-world settings."}
