I suspect some component in the circuit is confusing me. :)\n\nWith all three removed now, I measured the resistance to ground on Pad 2 of those coils, and all measure 1.6 \u03a9 .\nAll three pads seem to be directly connected to each other, as their resistance to each other is 0.2 \u03a9 - actually, looking at the schematic, they are all connected by the very low value (0.00075 \u03a9) resistors R7410, R7420 and R7430, so that would make sense.\n\nPad 2 of F7000 (PPBUS_G3H) shows a short to Pad 1 of L7420 (GTVR_SW2)\nThe only thing the board view says should be connected to Pad 2 F7000 is Pins 21 & 24 of U7420 and to Pin 1 of R7424 (which isn't populated on this board).\n\nSo I assume U7420 is the issue here???"}
