I suspect some component in the circuit is confusing me. :)\n\nWith all three removed now, I measured the resistance to ground on Pad 2 of those coils, and all measure 1.6 Ω .\nAll three pads seem to be directly connected to each other, as their resistance to each other is 0.2 Ω - actually, looking at the schematic, they are all connected by the very low value (0.00075 Ω) resistors <RESISTOR>R7410</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7420</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7430</RESISTOR>, so that would make sense.\n\nPad 2 of F7000 (<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>) shows a short to Pad 1 of L7420 (<SIGNAL>GTVR_SW2</SIGNAL>)\nThe only thing the board view says should be connected to Pad 2 F7000 is Pins 21 & 24 of <CHIP>U7420</CHIP> and to Pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R7424</RESISTOR> (which isn't populated on this board).\n\nSo I assume <CHIP>U7420</CHIP> is the issue here???"
