I do get a green light. so im down to the 3v3\/5v_sus not being enabled which comes from U1800. Not getting P5v_3v3_SUS_EN on Q7822. Q7820 gives me no voltage on pin 1 q7840 gives 0.001v on pin 1.\n\nnow i have 0.400v on pp3v3_s4\n\npp3v3_s5 = 3.3v\nppvrtc_g3h = 3.3v\npp3v3_SUS = 0v\nPP5v_SUS = 0v"}
