Occasionally have green \/ orange light when good charger is plugged in. Board has no visible signs of liquid damage, but customer did admit to using a generic charger.\nPPBUS G3H is 8.64 as measured at F7140.\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.32 measured at C5126\nPP3V3_S4 is .4 measured at C5460, resistance to ground measures 495\n\nWhere to go from here?"}
