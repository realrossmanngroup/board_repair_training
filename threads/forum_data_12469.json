I have a 820-3476 with no backlight (can see the apple logo with flashlight). The board seems not to have liquid damage looks very clean also the area round U7700 and LCD Connector. I get 12.61v on pin 9\/10. I did notice I have no voltage on the backlight Enable pin 17, what should this be? R7742 = 0 ohm. Any suggestions?\n\nEDIT: Some extra messure i did:\n\nC7717 pin 1 = 5.17v\nQ7700 pin 3 = 12.51v\nQ7700 pin 4 = 12.61v\nQ7700 Pin 1\/2\/3\/4 = 0v\nR7701 = 80.3k ohm\nR7702 = 63.5k ohm\n\nSo i figure the enable signal is not working for the backlight, please correct me if im wrong in my assumption"}
