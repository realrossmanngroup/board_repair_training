The board seems not to have liquid damage looks very clean also the area round <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> and LCD Connector. I get 12.61v on pin 9/10. I did notice I have no voltage on the backlight Enable pin 17, what should this be? <RESISTOR>R7742</RESISTOR> = 0 ohm. Any suggestions?\n\nEDIT: Some extra messure i did:\n\n<CAPACITOR>C7717</CAPACITOR> pin 1 = 5.17v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> pin 3 = 12.51v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> pin 4 = 12.61v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> Pin 1/2/3/4 = 0v\n<RESISTOR>R7701</RESISTOR> = 80.3k ohm\n<RESISTOR>R7702</RESISTOR> = 63.5k ohm\n\nSo i figure the enable signal is not working for the backlight, please correct me if im wrong in my assumption"
