The client told me that first, the cam stopped working, and them it just starts to rebooting.\nAlready replace the disk, but with the same results. I've notice a bit of corrosion on the U1900 and I've lift it up and soldered back again , but with the same result.\n\nBooting without the cam doesn't solved the problem.\n\nCan you help?"}

Thanks!\nDo I need to leave it without the resistor, or can I check some components to make sure if the cam can be saved?"}

You can also try to replace U1900.\nIf there are some instabilities on the clock it can cause the camera IC to crash, and in turn crash the camera driver and cause macOS to reboot when it tries to load it.\nBy removing R2030, the camera IC is turned off so camera won't work but at least it doesn't crash."}
