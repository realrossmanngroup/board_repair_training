The client told me that first, the cam stopped working, and them it just starts to rebooting.\nAlready replace the disk, but with the same results. I've notice a bit of corrosion on the <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> and I've lift it up and soldered back again , but with the same result.\n\nBooting without the cam doesn't solved the problem.\n\nCan you help?"

You can also try to replace <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>.\nIf there are some instabilities on the clock it can cause the camera IC to crash, and in turn crash the camera driver and cause macOS to reboot when it tries to load it.\nBy removing <RESISTOR>R2030</RESISTOR>, the camera IC is turned off so camera won't work but at least it doesn't crash."
