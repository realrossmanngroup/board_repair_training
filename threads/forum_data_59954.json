    "definitions": {
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PCH_INTRUDER_L": "What is PCH_INTRUDER_L? PCH_INTRUDER_L is a signal that tells the machine the case has been opened by an intruder when it is low, the _L means it is present when it is low. This signal should always be high in a Macbook since it doesn’t use intrusion detection. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",
        "PCH_INTVRMEN": "What is PCH_INTVRMEN? PCH_INTVRMEN is an Internal Voltage Regulator Enable: When pulled high, this signal enables\nthe internal 1.05 V regulators for the Suspend well in the PCH. This signal must\nremain asserted for the VRMs to behave properly (no glitches allowed).\nThis signal must be pulled-up to VCCRTC on desktop platforms and may\noptionally be pulled low on mobile platforms if using an external VR for the\nVCCSUS rail.",
        "C0895": "What is C0895? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present."
