You're making my eyes bleed reading that.\n\nIt seems like there is a short circuit on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>. This will be difficult to find because at 124 ohms it will only use up something like 0.1 watts which will produce virtually no heat at all. Your job here is to inject 3.42v into <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and find what gets hot, but without some sort of expensive thermal camera or freeze spray that will be very difficult to do."

You said earlier that <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> had 124 ohms to ground, and that makes far more sense when combined with the rest of the available information. This is supported by the fact that the SMC gets hot.\n\nHowever, you have also said that replacing the SMC does not fix the issue of the SMC getting hot. This makes absolutely no sense and brings us back to square one, unless you are replacing it with other bad SMCs, or soldering it very improperly, which is possible.\n\nI would remove the SMC and see how many amps <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is using without the SMC. Wick the pads so no residual solder is causing a short. With the SMC removed, how many amps are pulled injecting 3.42v into <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>?"
