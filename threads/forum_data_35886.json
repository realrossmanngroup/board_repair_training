        "message":"hi i have got a macbook air 820-3437-B with liquid damage when you connect it to the charger green\/orange light turns on but fan doesn't spin there was some corrosion around U6100 and SMC so i cleaned it up, on L7140 i got 1.8V that meant so i removed L7140 and pin number 2 is shorted to ground when i send 4V to pin number 2 the only thing that heats up is the CPU, on the schematic PPBUS_G3H doesn't go to CPU (PCH) also i checked for more shorted lines and i found all of the bellow rails are shorted to ground\n\nPPBUS_G3H\nPPBUS_G3H_R\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS\nPP1V05_S0_PCH_VCCACLKPLL_R\n\nwith diode mode it shows 0010 on both sides\n\ni tried to remove some caps around the CPU but the short is still there, the problem can't find the short by detecting the heat because the only part that gets hot is the PCH\n\nthanks"
