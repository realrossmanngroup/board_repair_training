        "820-3330": "What is 820-3330? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",

        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

It still woudn't boot since <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was way below 12V so I was under the impression that maybe it wasn't solidly soldered on. I heated it up again but this time while gently pressing down to make sure all the pins make good contact. This actually made the system boot again properly, but was rather unstable (Would power off after a few minutes of using).\n\nAfter this I decided to get <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> from another donor board because these boards come from who knows were. With this chip soldered on the system wouldn't boot and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was once again too low. \n\nSo I just bought a spool of these chips because they're not that expensive, however a new chip didn't resolve the issue either, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was still at 1.18V. The issue is probably with the circuit around it, not with the chip itself.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is also not shorted to ground, removing the fuses still keeps <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> on almost the same voltage of 1.18V\n\nVoltages:\n(Using a original apple 85W charger.)\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.43V (Pin 12/VHST on <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>)\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 1.18V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V1_CHGR_VDD</SIGNAL> = 5.4V (VDD & VDDP on <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>)\n\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_S5_CHOP</SIGNAL> = 18.42V\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> = 4.46V (Pin 3/ACIN on <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>)\n\n\nThanks in advance for the help again"
