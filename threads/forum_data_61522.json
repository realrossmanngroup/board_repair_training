I soldered then the chip back\n\ndiagnostic was the smc had no clock signal, i pulled it from the board gave a reballing and soldered back.\nthe machine was like \"brain dead\" but already got a fan spin\n\nso i got from another formum vinafxx a clear me bios, flashed the u6100 and solder it back.\n\nnow the machine is working very good but camera is not installed problem, als is working, dimms the kb after closing the cam\n\ni tryed from a new display connected to j4200 but still the same\ni checked the clock CLK25M_CAM_CLKP  for u3900 is there,\n\n i2c lines from j4200 to u3900\nMIPI_CLK_P and \/N\nMIPI_DATA_P and \/N\nPCIE_CAMERA_R2D_P and \/N\nPCIE_CLK100M_CAMERA_C_P and \/N\nPCIE_CAMERA_D2R_C_P and \/N\n\n have the same diode mode values like from a working board\n\nI found in the forum that can a problem with the bios, so i found here a clear me bios for my 2017 8G 1.8 machine\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https:\/\/boards.rossmanngroup.com\/threads\/820-00165-a-no-image.60948\/[\/URL]\n[SIZE=5][B][URL='https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1i5bqpxaR8b9qrkJspJSwV_sarnmctwZN\/view?usp=sharing']2017 - J1WK clean ME - working - 1.8Ghz_8GB.rar[\/URL][\/B][\/SIZE]\n\nbut with this bios still no camera working, tryed with both displays.\n\nL3901 1.2V\nL3902 1.38V\n\nis it worth to replace u3900 in this diagnostic state?"
