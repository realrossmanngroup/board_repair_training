It\u2019s a laptop I bought in November, as a repair project.\nThere were quite a few problems with it.\nI struggled with it but I replaced the connector and the receptacle on the logic board. \n\nThere was also corrosion on the tcon board, replaced that but I didn\u2019t know if new tcon was working, it arrived from eBay not secured properly and slightly bent. I\u2019m currently thinking about buying whole new lcd assembly and replacing that.\nSo there\u2019s my question to be sure that I\u2019m doing the right thing at the moment\nI also replaced components around touchbar connector and touchbar connector itself."}

It might be possible that I haven\u2019t soldered the gmux properly. Is there a way to check for signals with a multimeter to see if the multiplexer is doing what it\u2019s supposed to?"}
