It’s a laptop I bought in November, as a repair project.\nThere were quite a few problems with it.\nI struggled with it but I replaced the connector and the receptacle on the logic board. \n\nThere was also corrosion on the tcon board, replaced that but I didn’t know if new tcon was working, it arrived from eBay not secured properly and slightly bent. I’m currently thinking about buying whole new lcd assembly and replacing that.\nSo there’s my question to be sure that I’m doing the right thing at the moment\nI also replaced components around touchbar connector and touchbar connector itself."
