Watched video about similar problem in MacBook air board [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u14u1q_GjRg[/URL], but in MBP 17\" this switching power supply works a bit different, board is clean, checked data lines and pull up resistors - they are fine (so system can see and charge the battery) - but I do not quite understand how switching into battery power works in this MacBook. checked F7040 & F7041 8A FUSES, they are fine <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> - seems to be fine too , maybe <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> - LT3470A is bad or some components around it? If somebody can give me some advices it would be great. Board is not liquid damaged, works perfect but system does not run on battery (all reset done before testing so it is hardware issue - also tested on two different batteries).\n\nTIA Sebastian"
