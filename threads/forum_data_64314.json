        "message":"This 2020 MacBook Air (820-01958) shows no signs of damage other than a bad battery, which I replaced. It loads Internet Recovery very slowly and, after 20 minutes, always ends with error -2003F. It fails to enter DFU mode (both keyboard method and using FORCE_DFU pins). So I removed and reflashed the SoC ROM chip (U4770), which allowed me to do a successful DFU Restore. \n\nHowever, it still won't load Internet Recovery. It does load Apple Hardware Test which ends with \"no issues found\". \n\nAnything recommended to try before I give up on this board?"
