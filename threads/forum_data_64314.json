            "message": "This 2020 MacBook Air (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01958</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) shows no signs of damage other than a bad battery, which I replaced. It loads Internet Recovery very slowly and, after 20 minutes, always ends with error -2003F. It fails to enter DFU mode (both keyboard method and using <SIGNAL>FORCE_DFU</SIGNAL> pins). So I removed and reflashed the SoC ROM chip (<CHIP>U4770</CHIP>), which allowed me to do a successful DFU Restore. \n\nHowever, it still won't load Internet Recovery. It does load Apple Hardware Test which ends with \"no issues found\". \n\nAnything recommended to try before I give up on this board?"
