Boots, detects battery and will charge it, but after a certain amount of time, the magsafe LED will just turn off and the machine won't take charge. Unplugging and plugging the magsafe back in from an outlet will cause the light to reappear and the computer to receive magsafe power again, and anywhere from a few mins\/an hour the cycle will repeat. The magsafe will stay dark until you unplug\/replug from wall, regardless of battery being connected or not.\n\nWtf is up? Tried two good magsafes and multiple outlets. Haven't tried another DC-IN board yet, wanted 2 get opinions first."}
