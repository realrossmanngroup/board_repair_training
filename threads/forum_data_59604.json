I am trying to power <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_GPU</SIGNAL> with my bench supply but not sure how to find the start of that circuit. I have the schematic and board view open but finding the start of each rail after 12v is beyond me.\n\nI won't ask for anyone to hold my hand but banging my head on the desk at this point isn't working out well.  Where do I start and should I even be trying to power this rail to start or do something else. I am getting shorts on 20 or so components and all are related to <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_GPU</SIGNAL> when I check them in board view. I am also getting 0.8v on this rail when I believe I should be getting around 1.1-1.2 if I am not mistaken.\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit:  <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_GFX_PH1</SIGNAL> also shorted which I am assuming comes before <SIGNAL>SO_GPU</SIGNAL>.\n\nEdit2: Ok I'm stupid CPU rail also has a short. I am working backwards here when I think I need to work forwards. Not sure where the hell to look to find trace down where it all begins."
