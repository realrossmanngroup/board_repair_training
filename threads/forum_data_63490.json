It will detect hard drive fine, but if pluged with mouse or wireless mouse receiver, or any small powered usb,it doesnt work.\nThe other usb port is working fine. \nThere's 5v on each side of L4600.\n<SIGNAL>USB_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is 3.3v\n\nI have tried replacing <CHIP>U4650</CHIP> and <CHIP>U4600</CHIP>, but still the same, any idea ?"

I thought diode only died by shorting itself, but it can interfere like this..\nReplaced with donor's, and usb 2 is now working, Thank you very much sir!!"
