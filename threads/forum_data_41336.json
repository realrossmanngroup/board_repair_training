Came without HDD, HDD cable, ODD, ODD cable. Trackpad cable ripped, many screws missing :confused:\n\nScreen has signs of liquid damage, most likely dead. All 3 Backlight connector pads corroded, backlight fuse blown. Removed screen connector from board and waiting for new one to arrive.\n\nThe board:\n- Q7055 corroded, replaced.\n- U7000 getting hot when charger plugged in, U7000 + surrounding SMD replaced.\n- power rails from U7201 missing, U7201 replaced, rails present.\n- minor corrosion at R7120. R7120, C7126, C7131, C7133, C7196 replaced.\n\nNow I got high RPM fan spin and chime. Really happy I managed to get fan spin.\nI don't have a known good screen, so I'm working with mini DP out and external monitor.\nGot question mark folder. Wanted to know why fan spins at high RPM, so I tried ASD EFI 3S132 on USB port, getting stuck at graphics while loading. With ASD OS I get Apple logo, circle animation, then kernel panic. I don't know how to continue at this point so I'm hoping for your help.\n\nThis is my first board I'm working on so I really hope I get it fixed. [SIZE=8px]Please don't tell me it's the GPU :([\/SIZE]"}
