This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. ."

Trackpad cable ripped, many screws missing :confused:\n\nScreen has signs of liquid damage, most likely dead. All 3 Backlight connector pads corroded, backlight fuse blown. Removed screen connector from board and waiting for new one to arrive.\n\nThe board:\n- <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> corroded, replaced.\n- <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> getting hot when charger plugged in, <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> + surrounding SMD replaced.\n- power rails from <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> missing, <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> replaced, rails present.\n- minor corrosion at <RESISTOR>R7120</RESISTOR>. <RESISTOR>R7120</RESISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7126</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7131</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7133</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7196</CAPACITOR> replaced.\n\nNow I got high RPM fan spin and chime. Really happy I managed to get fan spin.\nI don't have a known good screen, so I'm working with mini DP out and external monitor.\nGot question mark folder. Wanted to know why fan spins at high RPM, so I tried ASD EFI 3S132 on USB port, getting stuck at graphics while loading. With ASD OS I get Apple logo, circle animation, then kernel panic. I don't know how to continue at this point so I'm hoping for your help.\n\nThis is my first board I'm working on so I really hope I get it fixed. [SIZE=8px]Please don't tell me it's the GPU :([/SIZE]"
