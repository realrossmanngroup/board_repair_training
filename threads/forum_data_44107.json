My mission is to take out user data. \n\nI have same configuration working logic board, what is i would transplant necessary ics? Which ics are married by software?"}

You may be better off trying to replace the CPU first before going the NAND route. But then you have the underfilled RAM next to the CPU too. Unless you can charge $600+ for this I would run away. Don't waste a working board on a low probability of getting data."}
