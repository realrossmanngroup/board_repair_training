            "message": "[B][U]Device History:[/U][/B]\nShip in repair, client stated this on his notes: \nThe unit was working fine, it came in for a broken screen. After we replaced the broken screen, we lost functionality of the touch bar. Our next step was to replace the entire top case, with a new touch bar included. After we did this, the computer no longer turned on at all. \n\n[B][U]What I have done: [/U][/B]\nThe first thing I did was plug in the unit, it was pulling 20v and about 30mA. I disconnected all the flexes, and plugged the board in, and it started pulling 20v - 400mA. Noticed a damaged touch bar connector (on flex, not on board) (if I connect battery, it will draw 20v-2.5amps)\nI do have trackpad feedback,\n no caps lock light. \nNo image (internal or external)\nAlso No USB activity\nCPU does get hot(normal operating temp), fans do turn on when the CPU is hot enough. \n\n[B][U]What measurements I've taken: [/U][/B]\n<SIGNAL>VCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>: 1.06 then drops to about .640v after a few seconds. \n<SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL>: steady 3v3\n\nI am not sure exactly where to go from here. Never faced an issue like this."
