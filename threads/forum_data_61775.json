For what they said this machine got liquid damaged some months ago, their client brought the machine to them, they cleaned the board and it worked for some months. Now the machine came back not working. They sent it to me and the symptom is that trackpad clicks, so it's in S0 state. I have 0.980V on L7210\/20, so there's VCORE, but I have no POST. No chime, no USB activity. R7842 had bad solder, so I replaced it, still same. What else could I look, since as they cleaned it before there's no signs of corrosion anymore on the board."}
