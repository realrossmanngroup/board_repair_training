After which the fan panic begun (Full Speed, Full Noise), and we are uncertain what triggered the fan panic. \n\nWhile furthur diagnosing the Mac, we swapped the Mac logic board into another MacBook Air 2017, and the fan continues... We also have inspected the board, under a microscope and thermal cam and nothing looks unusual not overheats. \n\nO Mac experts, I seek your advice...\n\nGod bless, \nMalik."
