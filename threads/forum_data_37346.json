Progress bar stuck at the end.\n\nI am providing the original Bios that I could dump but I  guess it is messed up for some reasons so if someone could provide a nice clean Bios for that board model, that would help.\nThanks.\n[url]https://www.dropbox.com/s/46s2wsm206bbpju/ST1857_2.8Ghz_8GB_2014_read1.BIN?dl=0[/url]"

In this case some windows boot file."
