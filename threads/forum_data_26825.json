            "message": "Hey Guys working on this 15in <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3662</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> does not turn on has green light on charger, has a short to ground on ppbus G3h circut So i removed fuses 7040 and 7041 put meter in diode mode short shows up on pin2 going to system. Then i injected voltage and nothing really gets hot but i used a flair inferred and only saw <CHIP>U7310</CHIP> getting warm so i removed chip from board, tested for short and short was gone I replaced <CHIP>U7310</CHIP> chip tested for short again and it was back any ideas on what component is causing this short?"
