Although it does seem to be running hot and the fans are kicking in hard from time to time. \n\nI've had it running a full screen 1080 video for over an hour and it's still OK, should I consider this fixed or should I disable the AMD graphics? (if yes what is now the preferred method?) Or is there a better way of stress testing this before giving it back?\nAgain thanks for your help on this. \n\n[ATTACH]60633[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH width=\"150px\"]60629[/ATTACH][ATTACH]60630[/ATTACH][ATTACH]60631[/ATTACH][ATTACH]60632[/ATTACH]"
