There is no green light. Fans spin with SMC BYPASS but no image no sound not booting. \n\n\nGetting this values on main rails: \n\n\nPPBUS_G3H  8.41V \n\nPPBUS_CPU_IMVP_ISNS 8.41V\n\nPPDCIN_G3H 17.04V\n\nPP3V42_G3H 3.42V \n\nPP3V3_S5 3.3V\n\n\n\nThe only thing i noticed it that on U7000  the resistance between 27\/28 is 21.9 and 17\/18 is 21.5 too. I know for ISL 6529 second value mst be about 3ohm but seems that this one (ISL6258...) is 21 both. ANyway changed it and same things happening. \n\n\nAny suggestion?"}
