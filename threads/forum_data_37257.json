Traces of liquid near SMC, U7701 and U3210. \n\nUltrasonic cleaned, jump wire from C3286 pin 1 to pin 18 of U3210 as the test point between them had nearly vanished.\n\nU7701 removed and replaced as it looked bad and I couldn't guarantee there wasn't crap under it.\n\nSMC had a bit of a reflow to see if it changed anything.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.59v\nPP5V_S5 = 5.04v\nPP3v3_S5 = 3.33v\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0v\nSMC_PM_G2_EN = 3.42v\n\nAny ideas before I remove the SMC to take a look under there?"

PP3v3_S4 drops to 0.45v and sits there.\n\nThe damage was in the U3210 area, so I swapped out U3210 to see if it made a difference.\n\nI now get PP3v3_S4 and it seems like its on because the CPU is getting hot after a min or so and VCORE is a constant 1.8v\n\nStill no fan spin though."
