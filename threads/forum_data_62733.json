I also made a typo error, the first board was 820-3435-B.\n \nFor the macbook air 820-3435-B\n-With Charger plugged in fan spins temporarily and stops.\n-Triggered SMC_ONOFF_L , charger light changed from amber to green and back to amber, got a fan spin temporarily and PM_SLP_S4 went high temporarily. Both fan spin and PM_SLP_S4 occured simultaneously. \n-As for the coils, I'm not sure what coils to check, pls can you specify for me what coils to check.\n\n\nFor the macbook air 820-00164-A\n- With charger plugged in nothing happened \n- Triggered SMC_ONOFF_L,  there was no reaction at all\n- I rechecked the those signals that will bring about PM_SLP_S4 \nPCH_INTVRMEN is 2.3V\nPCH_DSWVRMEN was alsi 2.3V\nPM_RSMRST_L  was 3V they were not up to 3.3V\nAll other voltages was present and they were 3.3V"}
