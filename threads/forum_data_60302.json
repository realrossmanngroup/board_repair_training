            "message": "Hi!\nI'm an electronics student from Austria trying to fix a Macbook Pro <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> from a friend of mine. He took it to an Apple store and they said it is a liquid damage and wanted to charge him 1300€ for a new logic board. Thus, he asked me if I could fix it. I have watched numerous videos from Louis on the \"stuck at 5V\" topic and started investiagting the issue\nHere is a short summary of what I've done so far. \n\nA visual inspection did not gave any obivous hints to a damaged part.\nFirst I've checked the USB port and noticed that it got stuck at 5V and draws approx. 20mA. As suggested in multiple videos, I've measured the voltage rails around the <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP>.\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> = 5V and is present at <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>,\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = ~0V \n\nThen I've checked the supply rail of the USB-C port controllers, which was 0V.\n--> <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> = ~0V\nbut the enable signal from <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> was present. Thus, I've checked if <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is shorted, which it was. As suggested in a video by Louis, it is very likely, that a <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> is responsible for this short, UB300. Thus, I've supplied 3.3V into the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> rail and identified the faulty <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> with the \"alcohol on chip\" method. Then I desoldered this chip and the short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> was gone. I ordered a replacement and soldered it in. \nHowever, the issue remained. The two ports, including the one I've fixed, stayed at constant 5V/20mA, but the other two ports did power cycle like in this video.\n[MEDIA=youtube]vXAK2l1oMZM[/MEDIA]\nLouis replaced the TB SPI Flash chip in this video and resolved the issue. I was not sure if a fresh chip from Mouser will do the job or if it needs some pre flashed data. Anyway, I ordered fresh SPI Flash chips and gave it a shot. After I've desoldered <CHIP>U2890</CHIP>, these two USB-C ports did not power cycle any longer and this behavior persited after I soldered the fresh chip from mouser.\n\nHowever, I've got stuck at this point and would need some further advice. First I've thought that the <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP> could be the problem, as <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is not present, I've replaced it but it did not change anything. Could there be another faulty <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> or could it be a faulty SMC chip?\n\nBoard Rev.: <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A\n\nThanks in advance!\nKind regards\nMichael"

The <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> are fine, they power cycle and I've measured 1.1V on each 1V1 LDO rail. However, the 1V1 LDO rail is missing on the other two <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> (UB300, UB400). So I guess they are both faulty. Even the one I've replaced. Do you have any suggestions on where to buy good CD3215C00 chips? Shipping costs from the US (store.rossmanngroup.com) are fairly high, but if there aren't any alternatives, I would go for it."
