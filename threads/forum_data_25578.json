No noticeable liquid. One cap on PP3v42 had a mark. Replaced cap and U7090 area. Now have green light\n\n\nDoes not get hot, does not spin fan or turn on.\n\npp3v42 - 3.4v\ngreen light present\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.15v = SMC not turning on ?\nTried a light SMC reflow, no difference.\n\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0v\nSMC_PM_G2_EN = 0v\nSMC_RESET_L = 3.4v\nPP3v3_s5= 3.3v\n\nPP5v_s5= 0.003v - is this important with PPBUS_G3H being low ? i assume that U7501 will only turn on with 8.5v and hence won't generate the 5v rail\nDiode mode to ground on PP5v_S5 = 0.417v so does not appear to be shorted\n\n\nJust wondering if anything else to try before replace SMC please. (i struggle with SMCs, sorry)"}
