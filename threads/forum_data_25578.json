        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

Now have green light\n\n\nDoes not get hot, does not spin fan or turn on.\n\npp3v42 - 3.4v\ngreen light present\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 8.15v = SMC not turning on ?\nTried a light SMC reflow, no difference.\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> = 0v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> = 0v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> = 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>= 3.3v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>= 0.003v - is this important with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> being low ? i assume that <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> will only turn on with 8.5v and hence won't generate the 5v rail\nDiode mode to ground on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 0.417v so does not appear to be shorted\n\n\nJust wondering if anything else to try before replace SMC please. (i struggle with SMCs, sorry)"
