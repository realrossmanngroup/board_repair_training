I forgot to reply last time...\nJust to share my experience with the forum, maybe can help someone in the future.\n\nIssue was simple.\nFake/not working CD321500C chips.\nBought them from a thrusted seller, i've already bought those in the past from this guy. Never had issues before. \n\nAfter spending days wondering why <SIGNAL>LDO_BMC</SIGNAL> stays 0v even with charger connected.... I replaced both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> left side from donor board and voilà... \nmotherboard now works flawlessy.\n\nWith the crappy chips all others LDO voltage were fine, and also diode mode readings ... That's why I get caught up.\nI tried 5 of them , same problem. Throw directly to the bin.\n\nThanks anyway for your time."
