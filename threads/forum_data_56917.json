The left side USB ports don't work. I replaced the USB connector and it's still the same. The front one shows absolutely nothing on the USB meter. The back one shows 5V but no current. The right ports work fine. But just now, after trying the left rear port again, it said 20V (and no current) and the right ones didn't work. I did an SMC reset and they worked again. Any ideas? No visible signs of damage."}

PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO is at .035 and PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO is at .085. Not sure what's pulling them down."}
