            "message": "Have a 000165 with widespread liquid damage. The wierd thing is when i use a new I/O board, it shows the \"battery voltage low\" screen (battery with red and the lightning bolt). I tried two other known good ones and same thing. I change back to the damaged original and it doesnt happen.  Obviously this is not right. I have been probing around the <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> area and see that on pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C7090</CAPACITOR>, or also pin 3 of <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>, it reads 7.02 volts... this seems like an odd voltage given it is <SIGNAL>P3V42G3H_BOOST</SIGNAL>. also, DCIN reads 20V. the resistors in that area really check out fine. Ideas?"
