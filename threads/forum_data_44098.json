But on the other hand it doesn't pull any current when I check my little usb power meter: 20.3V  0A\nThe thing as this board is relatively new, I don't have yet the brd and schematics files to correctly diagnose it.\nI will attempt to clean it.\nQuestion what would be the closer board regarding the schematics to be able to work on it.\n\nThanks"
