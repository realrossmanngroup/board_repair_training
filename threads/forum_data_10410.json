        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "CPU_VR_EN": "What is CPU_VR_EN? CPU_VR_EN is an enable signal for CPU VCORE that is present when it is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. ALL_SYS_PWRGD, PM_RSMRST_L, PM_SLP_SUS_L, and PM_SLP_S3_L are necessary prerequisites for CPU_VR_EN to be present. .",
