I found that <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4</SIGNAL> is missing so I traced that back to the CPU. Found that <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL> is missing. Checked for <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is missing as well. Based on schematic, this signal is generated by <CHIP>U8160</CHIP> but on the board its NC. Now I am lost. Any ideas ?"
