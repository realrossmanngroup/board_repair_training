        "820-3462": "What is 820-3462? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "A1425": "What is A1425? A1425 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Early 2013, Late 2012 with EMC 2672, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3190, 820-3462..",

        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "R6905": "What is R6905? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on older Macbooks, pre-2011 models. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",
