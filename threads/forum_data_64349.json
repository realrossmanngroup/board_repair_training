    "definitions": {
        "A2141": "What is A2141? A2141 is a model number for a 16 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2019 with EMC 3347, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01700..",
        "820-01700": "What is 820-01700? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP1V8_S5": "What is PP1V8_S5? PP1V8_S5 is a 1.8v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. .",
        "PMU_ACTIVE_READY": "What is PMU_ACTIVE_READY? a SIGNAL.",
        "PMU_CLK32K_PCH": "What is PMU_CLK32K_PCH? a SIGNAL.",
        "PMU_ONOF_L": "What is PMU_ONOF_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "R8013": "What is R8013? a RESISTOR.",
        "PP1V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V8_SLPS2R? PP1V8_SLPS2R is a 1.8v power rail present when the system is in a SLPS2R state. .",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V1_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V1_SLPS2R? The PP1V1_SLPS2R power rail in the MacBook schematic provides a 1.1-volt supply in a specific low-power state indicated by the \"_SLPS2R\" suffix and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP1V2_AWAKE": "What is PP1V2_AWAKE? The PP1V2_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides 1.2 volts and is associated with the machine's awake state and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP3V3_AWAKE": "What is PP3V3_AWAKE? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP0V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP0V8_SLPS2R? a SIGNAL."
