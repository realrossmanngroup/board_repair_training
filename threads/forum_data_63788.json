If we disconnect the battery and reconnect, it then starts charging as normal.\n\nThe board looks pristine. \n\nWe've tested another with another battery and it still faults in the same way. We've also tested in another housing and still the same. \n\nAny advice on what would be causing this or what we can do to resolve this?"
