Both had some power issues, not working from battery... so i replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and after replacement there was no <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> any more. Chips are new and soldered with hot air. I get green and orange light. There is power on pins 1 and 3 of <DIODE>D7005</DIODE>, but nothing on pin 2, also there is no power on output pins of <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>. I wonder if there is possible damage that i could have done with the heat, replacing <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>? because same thing happened with two boards.
