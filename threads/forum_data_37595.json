Both had some power issues, not working from battery... so i replaced U7100 and after replacement there was no PPBUS_G3H any more. Chips are new and soldered with hot air. I get green and orange light. There is power on pins 1 and 3 of D7005, but nothing on pin 2, also there is no power on output pins of Q7180. I wonder if there is possible damage that i could have done with the heat, replacing u7100? because same thing happened with two boards. I dont know what to look for anymore, everything looks ok.\n\nThank you for any help!"}
