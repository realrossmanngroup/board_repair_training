        "U1800": "What is U1800? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

When this is missing on a device that has an integrated GPU and no discrete GPU, it usually means either no screen is detected, or the GPU integrated into the CPU is dead..",

Fan spins and i get a green light (no battery connected), mouse cursor lights up. 0V on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>. I had no <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>, some liquid going on in that area. Replaced <RESISTOR>R5071</RESISTOR> and now have 3.4v here. Still have 0v on <RESISTOR>R1981</RESISTOR> <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> which comes straight out of <CHIP>U1800</CHIP>?

I found I have no power on <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL>, I guess I need this for the display to work.\n\nEDIT: I figured no AXG is normal when booting, so will check the rest. I connected a speaker and I do not get a chime and pram also doesnt seem to have any affect. Could it be an SMC issue as it seems it is not booting. WIth an external drive connected usually the blue light blinks when it boots but in this case it stays solidblue so it doesnt look like the board is trying to read the ssd drive."
