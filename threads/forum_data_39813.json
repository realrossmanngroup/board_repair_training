Fan spins and i get a green light (no battery connected), mouse cursor lights up. 0V on PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT. I had no SMC_LID, some liquid going on in that area. Replaced R5071 and now have 3.4v here. Still have 0v on R1981 LCD_BKLT_EN which comes straight out of U1800? Maybe liquid bellow U1800 or is there something else I need to have in order for LCD_BKLT_EN to get high? Tested witk known working display, connected."}

I found I have no power on PPVCORE_S0_AXG, I guess I need this for the display to work.\n\nEDIT: I figured no AXG is normal when booting, so will check the rest. I connected a speaker and I do not get a chime and pram also doesnt seem to have any affect. Could it be an SMC issue as it seems it is not booting. WIth an external drive connected usually the blue light blinks when it boots but in this case it stays solidblue so it doesnt look like the board is trying to read the ssd drive."}
