My strategy was to look in the schematics and search for a chip it was the output on. I have gone through the schematics many times and must be missing it. The closest chip I found was <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> on page 54 of the schematic, but that does not seem to clearly indicate that is the source. I see lots lines with <SIGNAL>PP3V2_S5</SIGNAL> as the prefix. But none with just <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> by its self. Could you help me understand what all of the other versions of pp3v3_s5_**** mean? I am just looking for a basic understanding in general. Also, where exactly is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> come from?"
