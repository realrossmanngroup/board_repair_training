The water is the stuff that leaves the white residue.\nAfter ultrasonic, i clean with fresh isopropyl and a soft brush. sometimes i use compressed air to blow it dry, gives me nice clean results."}

Usually the white residue appears in very small areas between contacts on chips.\n\nWhat have you found is the best way to avoid this?"}
