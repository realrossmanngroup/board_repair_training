The screen stays black, but when I put in external monitor it will show logo and load about 1\/3 and hang. So far I disconnected  the internal HDD and tried to boot of external HDD, same result, boot and hang. I disconnected keyboard and booted with external keyboard, same. Did the SMC reset with no response, PRAM reset same, no change. Battery I disconnected and reconnected, still same.Disconnected machine's display, to eliminate possible short in there. Now I suppose I must go in, my hunch is SMC. Any more things to try before I take out the board, and if not, where do I look first, once the board is out, please? I felt heat over the GPU just using my finger. Could it be a similar cap issue supplying the GPU as in the 2010 15\" machines?"}
