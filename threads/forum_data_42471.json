The screen stays black, but when I put in external monitor it will show logo and load about 1/3 and hang. So far I disconnected  the internal HDD and tried to boot of external HDD, same result, boot and hang. I disconnected keyboard and booted with external keyboard, same. Did the SMC reset with no response, PRAM reset same, no change. Battery I disconnected and reconnected, still same.Disconnected machine's display, to eliminate possible short in there. Now I suppose I must go in, my hunch is SMC. Any more things to try before I take out the board, and if not, where do I look first, once the board is out, please? I felt heat over the GPU just using my finger. Could it be a similar cap issue supplying the GPU as in the 2010 15\" machines?"

[B]Now, just reprogram your clean ME Bios Bin[/B].\" Sounds scary, since I do not know how to reprogram my clean ME Bios ...yet. So I cannot pursue this...unless I have more info.\nRegarding the EFI ASD, I found out that I need ASD3S150, but so far cannot find a reliable link, nor any link really, for this utility,\nCould you please clue me know how to get into this aspect of fixing the board?\nFinally, Regarding Linux Live versus Windows Live, I assume that it is Linux, and not Windows. It is a friends machine, who is allowing me to try and fix it, to learn about board repair, and it had MAC OSX running on it, which is more like Linux, right?\nI am a junior member, heavy on the junior part, I suppose.."
