Since someone removed j6700 I figured I’d check <CHIP>U6201</CHIP> and it was shorting the 5v rail I changed it and now I’m booting fine. Fans spin It chimes But has no audio In OS X. the same issues as before but in reverse as Homer Simpson would say “d’oh“ :( I replaced j6700 and I found 3 Through hole traces were Burned. ( J6700 : pin 9, GND ‘I tied in to ground‘, pin 8 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SO</SIGNAL> ‘Also repaired’, pin 7 <SIGNAL>AUD_SPDIF_OUT</SIGNAL> ‘which I tried grounding and it did nothing’ So I left it without connecting it to anything’)Head phones do work but built in speakers don’t. How can I disable spdif Out. I have no red light inside port. :( I need like a jumper solution I’ve removed a few resistors and what I believe are filter capacitors still have gotten it right yet. <RESISTOR>R6805</RESISTOR> ? I don’t have the whole machine Todo a software disable\nI’m sorry I took this weekend to work on the bottom of the barrel\nThank you for your help"
