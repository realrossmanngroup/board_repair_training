Green light on charger and I can short the pins to turn it on. No chime, high fan spin & no video to LCD or external.  Q9806 was not looking nice and had very low readings on pins. Checked around and R9808, C9802 & R9809 are within spec.I replaced and now I have 0 volts on pins 1,2 & 6. 9.70v on pin 3, 12.6v on pin 4 & .03v on pin 5\n\nBefore chasing the no video issue what else should I be looking for with no chime and the high fan spin? Thanks!"}

Red probe on 3.42v Rail, black probe on ground.\n\nIt may be 30 secs before your multimeter will give an accurate resistance reading.\n\nDepending on this reading, we can determine if your boards MCP is faulty. Then you can throw this board in the donor pile."}
