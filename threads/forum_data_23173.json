No chime, high fan spin & no video to LCD or external.  <TRANSISTOR>Q9806</TRANSISTOR> was not looking nice and had very low readings on pins. Checked around and <RESISTOR>R9808</RESISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C9802</CAPACITOR> & <RESISTOR>R9809</RESISTOR> are within spec.I replaced and now I have 0 volts on pins 1,2 & 6. 9.70v on pin 3, 12.6v on pin 4 & .03v on pin 5\n\nBefore chasing the no video issue what else should I be looking for with no chime and the high fan spin?
