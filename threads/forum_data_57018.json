History as follows:\nCame In dead - customer claims tried to change battery to fix macbook - still dead.\nI open it and find a ton of flux on the bios chip, also notice <CHIP>U3990</CHIP> has been removed and <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> is not soldered on straight. I go ahead and replace <CHIP>U3990</CHIP> from a donor board, realign <TRANSISTOR>Q7085</TRANSISTOR> and then proceed to try and power up - no power still, I checked PPBUS which was at 0.8v, replaced the ISL which brought PPBUS back and board was powering up but no display so having known the BIOS chip has been messed around with before I pulled it to reprogram, found BIOS chip itself completely dead wouldnt even read in my programmer so i've programmed a new BIOS chip and soldered onto the board. \nBoard is now powering up but fans running on full speed - have done both SMC and PRAM resets but same, now loaded ASD which told me there is a problem with sensor TN1D - all other sensors pass. Out the board comes again and I put it in the ultrasonic and then try it again - now Apple ASD passes so I think great it's all fixed now, 1 minute later fans on it are running at full speed again and ASD (which was still booted up) reporting a problem with TN1D sensor again which I believe is for the nVidia Chipset. \nWould like some pointers as to where to check now - it was working fine immediately after ultrasonic and board looks clean - no obvious signs of liquid damage other than the previous repairer had put thermal paste all over the place which i've cleaned off."
