When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

High fan spin and no brain.\n\ni inspected the board and i dont see any other missing components\n\nsome of the capacitors near <TRANSISTOR>Q7550</TRANSISTOR> were corroded so i replaced those as well (<CAPACITOR>C7516</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7517</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7555</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7558</CAPACITOR>)\n\ncould bad <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> components being bad be the issue although the board is powering on because there are a couple corroded components i didnt replace for <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> only because they didnt look that bad and they were receiving their correct voltages.\n\n\ncpu vcore is only 0.800v from my understanding it has to be around 1.25v\n\ncpu and pch get hot so they are powering on.\n\nany ideas?"
