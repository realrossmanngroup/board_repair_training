        "message":"board came in with high fan spin no brain. once i got to work on it the board started working again it chimed and booted so since it had prior water damage i placed it into the ultrasonic to get rid of any lingering corrosion. upon putting it back together it wouldnt power on. after inspecting i could see r7141, c7105, r7151 and r7152 were gone. replaced all of those chips and now im back where i started. High fan spin and no brain.\n\ni inspected the board and i dont see any other missing components\n\nsome of the capacitors near q7550 were corroded so i replaced those as well (c7516,c7517,c7555,c7558)\n\ncould bad PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS components being bad be the issue although the board is powering on because there are a couple corroded components i didnt replace for PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS only because they didnt look that bad and they were receiving their correct voltages.\n\n\ncpu vcore is only 0.800v from my understanding it has to be around 1.25v\n\ncpu and pch get hot so they are powering on.\n\nany ideas?"
