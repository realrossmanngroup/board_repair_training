In the power pad I don't have 3.3v.\n\nthe history is it worked fine but from one day to the next it did not turn on again (this was a week ago)\n\nAny help to know what measures to take and diagnose? I would like to know if it has a short or the CPU is dead.\n\nthx u\n\nedit: Sorry I was testing a new connector, in case it helps, the original usb-c connector doesn't work in case this damage could have caused a short on the board"
