Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

After sometime display came back - and then started flickering on and off pretty fast for about 10-20 seconds. So i guess whatever the issue was on its way out. Now black screen when i shine a torch can see visual.\n\nI measured\n\n12.67v on ppbus\n3.42v present <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>\n\ni get 0v on both sides of <DIODE>D7701</DIODE> AND L7710\nhowever <DIODE>D7720</DIODE> and l7720 have 5v on both sides\n\nis this faulty <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>?"
