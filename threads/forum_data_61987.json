I am out of options (that I know of). What I did so far:\n\n- Tested different charger and battery\n- Checked every resistor around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and battery connector\n- Replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and re-balled and then replaced SMS (both at least twice)\n- Checked the battery data pullup resistors, proper ohm value and resistance\n\nAnything else that could cause this symptom and I am overlooking?\n\nThanks!"
