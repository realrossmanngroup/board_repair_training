All other values seem ok and are recognized like total mah and cycle. Has orange light on the charger. I am out of options (that I know of). What I did so far:\n\n- Tested different charger and battery\n- Checked every resistor around U7100 and battery connector\n- Replaced U7100 and re-balled and then replaced SMS (both at least twice)\n- Checked the battery data pullup resistors, proper ohm value and resistance\n\nAnything else that could cause this symptom and I am overlooking?\n\nThanks!"}
