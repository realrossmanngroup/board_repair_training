            "message": "Liquid damaged <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2914</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board where three pins on the LVDS connector were blown and the LVDS cable was also burned. The LVDS connector was replaced and now the screen gets picture but no backlight. Traced it back to the backlight driver, replaced the chip with a L8545SQ chip and the board gets and green light and fans spin but no post. With the old chip originally and after re-soldering the old chip back on to make sure the board wasn't further damaged the fans spin up, stop, then spin up again and after a few seconds chimes and posts. Is this considered \"quarter fan spin\" or most likely a short that is now happening after the power has been restored to the LCD Backlight traces with the new chip?"
