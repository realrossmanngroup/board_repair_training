Ive also had a couple of kernal panics during boot\n\nIm struggling to believe its the GPU itself as i have heated the Die of the chip and it made negligible difference.\nI have also resolsdered the GPU power regulator as you would on the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>'s\nI have replace a poly tant on the pp1v05 GPU rail.\n\nNothing has seemed to change much, im wondering if its something cold solder related somewhere as it seems to boot far less often when the heatsink is clamped down.\n\nI really dont know what my next step is? Change the caps on the GPU phases? fully reflow the GPU and see if the fault persists,ect\n\nmy main question is has anyone seen it before and fif they ever resolve it? \n\nThanks guys."
