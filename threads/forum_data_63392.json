        "message":"Hi everyone, \nI have an issue with this machine, laptop was after liquid damage and it was fixed works fine for over year no issues. \ntwo days ago Touch Bar stopped working, first touch didn't respond and after reboot display was gone too.\nTried Pram reset no luck.  \nthe liquid damage was around backlight IC u8400 also around the PPVout caps this all works fine since repair. \ntried 2 new Touch Bars also didn't resolve issue \nreplace both J5100 J5110 hoping this will help no luck \nchecked the voltages \nPP1V8_DFR present \nPP3V3_G3HSW_DFR present \nJ5100 SPI resistance \nspi_dfr_cs_l 5,15Mohm\nspi_dfr_mosi 5.15Mohm\nspi_dfr_miso_r 121.2 Kohm\nspi_dfr_clk 3.91Kohm\nSome voltage is coming up on this lines too. \nI've also checked relevant resistors they are also seams to be okay.\nAny ideas what should I look for more? \nThanks"
