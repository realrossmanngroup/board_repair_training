        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",

Stayed on the shelf for a while, until I started to watch Youtube repair videos. I thought it must have been the TI USBC mux, so I got a USBC power meter, but that showed 5V -> 20V transition, and 0A current draw.\n\nFurther diagnostics showed a good <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR</SIGNAL>, but everything else was missing (<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>- well, no battery connected.) SMC was suspect, but <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is present (3.4V).\n\nI doubt that all the rails are short to ground, so is the SMC suspect? How does one tell if the SMC is active and doing its job/jobs?\n\nAny next step debug suggestions much appreciated.\n\nNo water damage, clean board."
