        "820-00239": "What is 820-00239? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "CPU_VCORE": "What is CPU_VCORE? Power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. .",
        "Q3100": "What is Q3100? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "Q7065": "What is Q7065? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "HALL_SENSOR_LEFT": "What is HALL_SENSOR_LEFT? HALL_SENSOR_LEFT is a signal from the hall sensor on the left side of the machine that indicates that the lid has been closed. This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen.",
        "SMC_LID_RIGHT": "What is SMC_LID_RIGHT? SMC_LID_RIGHT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the right LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_RIGHT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

            "message": "Hello. I got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00239</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that was heavily liquid damaged on the U32/3100 side of the board. The board would turn on to flashing folder icon still even with this damage. I had to replace J3300, J4402, J6200 and <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> due to corrosion. The board now boots fine on all 4 ports and the touch bar is working. I can boot into the OS with out the battery flex cable connected and the computer works fine, except for the power button was not working. If I connect the battery and charger, I hear the charger dong sound and <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> is at 1v, but then it drops to 0v a few seconds after the dong sound and the board does not turn on. It seems to try to start and then shuts down and gets stuck in S5 state for some reason. Its taking 2.2 amps when in this state so the battery appears to still be charging. I tried the board in another topcase, which has a good battery and power button, but I still have the same issue with the battery and power button. When I press the power button, <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> does drop to 0v, but <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> stays at 3.3v. I know this usually means its an SMC issue, so I replaced the SMC with one from a donor but still have the same issues, so I don't think its an SMC issue."

I tried to start it in SMC bypass mode by holding down the power button and then connecting the charger, and it actually turns on with both the screen and battery connected, but its not actually in SMC bypass mode. The fans are not running and HWmonitor is still reporting all the system temps, which it normally does not in SMC bypass mode. The power button is still not working when booted in this mode, so I'm sure that's why it does not go into SMC bypass mode, by yet it still boots. If I turn if off and try and turn it back on, it does the same thing again where it boots, and then shuts down. I noticed also that it will not turn on automatically when you open the lid. It will only start when connecting the charger. It will also shut down when trying to start in Safe mode with battery and LCD connected."

I tried installing Mojave, Catalina, and Big Sur on it, and it corrupts the BIOS every time and I have to re flash it. I was able to do a fresh install of High Sierra though without it corrupting the BIOS. I can clone Big Sur onto the drive and boot to it, but if you try to do any kind of system update, the BIOS will get corrupted and the computer wont turn on. I cloned Big Sur v11.1 and tried to do an update from the OS to v11.2.1 and it corrupted the BIOS again. I found something online that mentions the computer needed to be on the right firmware version in order to access recovery mode and update. If I go to System information > Hardware, it says the System firmware version was like 139 or something like that, which seems very low. The two other Macbooks I have (<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>) that are on Big Sur have System Firmware version 429.80.1.0.0. I found another BIOS file online for this model and installed it and it updated the System Firmware to 267.0.0.0.0, and now I can boot into recovery mode without the -5101 error like I was getting before, but it still corrupts the BIOS when trying to install Big Sur. I think what I need is a working BIOS from the same model, that has already been updated to the 429.80.1.0.0 system firmware. You wouldn't happen to have a recent BIOS backup from a 2016 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with Big Sur already installed on it?"
