What on the trackpad line would hold down the Hdd from loading? i know the HDD gets power but it doesn't pull the data. ( I Have tried over 5 Hdd cables so i have factored out the cable and confirmed it is the Trackpad holding it down).  Needed this out of the shop on friday so any help will be a major help.  I also tried sonic cleaning it as that entire area had green on tabs."}

Trackpad is connected to the SMBUS data lines so can definitely cause issues with boot\/sensors etc."}
