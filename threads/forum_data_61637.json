It came in with 3 damaged\/exploded Caps on the Daughterboard\/Audioboard. The heat was burning a hole in the keyboard-backlight-sheet near the power-button. I changed the daughterboard an flex - the machine is running. Only the power-button don't work. A test with a known good keyboard shows the same problem. So i think it's not the keyboard.  \n\nWith a button on R5116 overething works fine.\nsmc_onoff_l = 3,429v"}
