The heat was burning a hole in the keyboard-backlight-sheet near the power-button. I changed the daughterboard an flex - the machine is running. Only the power-button don't work. A test with a known good keyboard shows the same problem. So i think it's not the keyboard.  \n\nWith a button on <RESISTOR>R5116</RESISTOR> overething works fine.\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> = 3,429v"
