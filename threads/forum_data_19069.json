            "message": "Hello,\non this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> (waterdamage) replacing some stuff (especially around the SMC) i get a green light for a second and than only a orange light in the charger even there is no battery connected. Before i cleaned it the cpu was getting warm (with orange light ; i did not recognize warm ram) and now after i cleaned it in a ultrasonic just the ram is getting warm. Not the cpu any longer. i think it is only <CHIP>U2600</CHIP> getting hot. The other 3 chips are warm too but not as warm as <CHIP>U2600</CHIP>. Also <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is only 1,6V and shorted (0,002V to GND on F7140). If i inject 1V in <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> <CHIP>U2600</CHIP> is also getting warm a bit and its drawing aroung 1A from my supply. I have no idea what to check now.\nThanks for any help!"
