Before i cleaned it the cpu was getting warm (with orange light ; i did not recognize warm ram) and now after i cleaned it in a ultrasonic just the ram is getting warm. Not the cpu any longer. i think it is only U2600 getting hot. The other 3 chips are warm too but not as warm as U2600. Also PPbus_G3H is only 1,6V and shorted (0,002V to GND on F7140). If i inject 1V in PPBUS_g3H U2600 is also getting warm a bit and its drawing aroung 1A from my supply. I have no idea what to check now.\nThanks for any help!"}

Sorry for the dumb question. Have you any idea how this could happen? Because i\u00b4m pretty sure it was working (or at least had a warm cpu not hot ram) after i finished soldering \/ before the cleaner. I thought maybe a component fell of the board or something..."}

Most likely is a trace\/resistor that was hanging on by a thread got destroyed in the U\/S. This may have caused the RAM power supply to go high frying the RAM\/CPU."}
