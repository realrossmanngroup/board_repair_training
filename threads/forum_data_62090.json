    "definitions": {
        "A2179": "What is A2179? A2179 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2020 with EMC 3302, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01958..",
        "820-01958": "What is 820-01958? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP5V_G3S": "What is PP5V_G3S? PP5V_G3S is a 5v power rail present when the system is in a G3S standby state.",
        "PP3V3_G3H_RTC": "What is PP3V3_G3H_RTC? PP3V3_G3H_RTC Is one of the first rails that has to come on in order for the USB-C mux chip to be powered in the T2 chip Macbook Pros..",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H? This is the input from the USB-C charger or the battery that is the input voltage for the chip responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H. It can be missing when capacitors on this line are shorted to ground, or when the diode in front of it leading to the chip that creates PP3V3_G3H is blown. .",
        "PPBUS_HS_CPU": "What is PPBUS_HS_CPU? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP1V8_G3S": "What is PP1V8_G3S? a SIGNAL.",
        "CPU_VR_EN": "What is CPU_VR_EN? CPU_VR_EN is an enable signal for CPU VCORE that is present when it is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. Signals with EN on the end enable whatever came before the EN if the signal is high. ALL_SYS_PWRGD, PM_RSMRST_L, PM_SLP_SUS_L, and PM_SLP_S3_L are necessary prerequisites for CPU_VR_EN to be present. .",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P5VG3S": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P5VG3S? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP1V05_PCH_CPU": "What is PP1V05_PCH_CPU? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V2_AWAKE": "What is PP1V2_AWAKE? The PP1V2_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides 1.2 volts and is associated with the machine's awake state and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP3V3_AWAKE": "What is PP3V3_AWAKE? a SIGNAL."
