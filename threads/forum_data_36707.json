Same result.\n\nThanks. Have a good one."}

I forgot to mention that I have replaced the cable with 821-00184. Trackpad works. External KB works.\nMore concerned with booting issues.\nalso will not chime due to no audio.\n\nInternal KB shows in Sys Report. Only power button working. This with new KB and connector.\n\nThanks Duke!"}

I2C_IOXP_SCL and SDA. Keyboard should be an easy fix and maybe it is causing the slow boot issues.\n\n\"Without a drive attached it will turn on, fans spin but screen will stay black.\" Fan should not spin on a 4924 that is not hot. Crap under SMC suspected."}
