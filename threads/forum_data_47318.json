PPBUS is jumping between 10.X V and 12,6 V) This board should start from a 85W charger without battery if i am right. I tested with customer battery (just in case) but still the same. Just in case i tested a different battery and it seems to work from that battery most of the times but still not from the charger. Also sometimes it turms itshelf right back off after a few seconds (sometimes it chimes - sometimes is turns off earlier. This happens from battery and battery + charger). I traced this back and came to <DIODE>D6990</DIODE> that was leaking charger voltage to the battery (0.2 V in diode mode but it should read OL between pin 1&2) So i replaced <DIODE>D6990</DIODE> (now its reading is OL) And it seems to start and work with the new battery.\nStill sometimes pulsing and fan twitch without batterty sometimes working fine..."
