No backlight, definitely has image on LCD. Checked pins 1-4, 2-5 and 3-6 on BKL connector, no voltage at all. Can't find a schematic for this board anywhere. Replaced LCD cable and reset PRAM, no change. Grateful for any help on this."}

You are pretty much on your own figuring this out. There is a backlight fuse on the board. Check for shorts to GND on all LED lines first.\nYou should first make 100% sure it is a board problem, find a cracked test LCD."}
