        "820-2915": "What is 820-2915? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "R7085": "What is R7085? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7080": "What is R7080? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7086": "What is R7086? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7081": "What is R7081? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7080": "What is Q7080? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_BMON": "What is CHGR_BMON? CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",
        "CHGR_AMON": "What is CHGR_AMON? CHGR_AMON provides DC current sense information to the SMC(System management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip). It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",
        "CHGR_BGATE": "What is CHGR_BGATE? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_AGATE": "What is CHGR_AGATE? a SIGNAL.",

        "PP5V1_CHGR_VDD": "What is PP5V1_CHGR_VDD? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_CSO_N": "What is CHGR_CSO_N? CHGR_CSO_N is one of the current sense lines for the battery. Resistance between CHGR_CSO_N and CHGR_CSO_P should be the resistance should be the total series resistance of the current sense resistors in the circuit, usually about 2.2 ohms.",
        "PP5V1_CHGR_VDDP": "What is PP5V1_CHGR_VDDP? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_CSI_N": "What is CHGR_CSI_N? CHGR_CSI_N is one of the current sense lines for the charger. Resistance between CHGR_CSI_N and CHGR_CSI_P should be the resistance should be the total series resistance of the current sense resistors in the circuit, usually about 20.02 ohms.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_DCIN": "What is SMC_DCIN? a SIGNAL.",
        "PBUS_VSENSE": "What is PBUS_VSENSE? a SIGNAL."
