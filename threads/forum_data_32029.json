        "message":"I started a thread for this one last week, but the information I had on it wasn't solid at the time. I started a new thread to keep things clean from the start:\n\n1. Board gets warm as normal, but there's no chime\/boot\/life, aside from the board having all primary rails--ppbus_g3h, 3v3r3v0_aon, 3v3_g3h, 5v_g3h, vrtc_g3h, 3v3_s0, 5v_s0, etc.\n2. CPU gets very warm, but I measured cpu vcore at .79v. Should this be closer to 1.0v like on other boards? Schematic says 1.8v, but I know that's the highest, not average.\n\nI don't have high hopes for this board, but wanted to ask before breaking the news to the customer. I don't even know what else to check on these, but I can provide any other measurements requested. Thanks so much, as usual, the help is tremendously appreciated."
