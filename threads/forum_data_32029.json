Board gets warm as normal, but there's no chime/boot/life, aside from the board having all primary rails--<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>5V_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>VRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>3V3_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>5V_S0</SIGNAL>, etc.\n2. CPU gets very warm, but I measured cpu vcore at .79v. Should this be closer to 1.0v like on other boards? Schematic says 1.8v, but I know that's the highest, not average.\n\nI don't have high hopes for this board, but wanted to ask before breaking the news to the customer. I don't even know what else to check on these, but I can provide any other measurements requested. Thanks so much, as usual, the help is tremendously appreciated."
