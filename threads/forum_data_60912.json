I am not sure whether this would stop the logic board from powering on though.  I put 1V into it and it takes 1 amp however i cannot find any components heating up.  Should i just start pulling capacitors on this rail?  Look forward to your insights as to why this board might not be turning on.  Please let me know if i have missed anything obvious...\nthanks from Scotland,\nWill"
