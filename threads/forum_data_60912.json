I changed out the blade SSD for an M2 and encountered this problem.  Swapped back and the problem persisted.  The Imac was working up to this point.  Have since successfully installed that drive in another Imac.  Tried reseating the processor in its socket but no improvement.  S5 rails are good but all power rails after are pulsing on power button press.\nI am using the 820-3478 schematic and boardview as 820-3481-A is not available.\n\nVoltages and drop to ground (positive multimeter probe on ground):\n\nRail                                Voltage                    Drop \n\nAlways on:\nPP3V_G3                       3.3V                          *\nPP12V_ACDC               12.04V                      540\nPP12V_G3H                 12.04V                      540\nPP3V42_G3H               3.43V                        319\n\nS5:\nPP12V_S5                     12.04V                       513\nPP5V_S5                       4.97V                         463\nPP3V3_S5                     3.31V                         141\n\nS4:\nPP5V_S4                        5V (pulse)               154\nPP3V2_S4                     1.1-3.3V (pulse)      322\nPP3V3_S4_AP               1.1-3.3V (pulse)      322\n\nS3:\nPP3V3_ENET                1.1-3.3V (pulse)       375\nPPVDDQ_S3                 1.5V (pulse)             296\nPPVDDQ_S3_DDR       1.5V (pulse)             181\n\nS0:\nPP12V_S0                     12V (pulse)               443\nPP12V_S0_GPUCORE  12V (pulse)               446\nPPHDD12_S0                12V (pulse)              612\nPP12V_S0_HDD           12V (pulse)               611\nPP12V_S0_BLC             12V (pulse)               501\nPP12V_S0_FBVDDQ     12V (pulse)              447\nPP5V_S0                         5V (pulse)               379\nPPHDD_S0                     not measured       379           - Only available on back of LB.     \nPP5V_S0_HDD               0V                            379          - Hard drive not plugged in.\nPP3V3_S0                       3.3V (pulse)           247\nPPSSD_S0                       3.3V (pulse)           246\nPP1V5_S0                        1.48V (pulse)        142\nPP1V5_S0_PCH              1.5V (pulse)           142\nPPDDRVTT_S0                700mV (pulse)      112\nPPCPUVCC_S0_CPU       1.76V (pulse)        020\n\nGPU:\nPPVCORE_S0_GPU         880mV (pulse)     010\nPPFBVDDQ_S0_GPU      1.54V (pulse)       046\nPP1V05_S0                      1V (pulse)             061\n\nThunderbolt:\nPP3V3_TBTLC                 3.3V                       397\nPP1V05_TBTLC               other side             001\nPP1V05_TBTCIO             other side            130\n\n\nI see there is what looks like a short on a thunderbolt rail PP1V05_TBTLC.  I am not sure whether this would stop the logic board from powering on though.  I put 1V into it and it takes 1 amp however i cannot find any components heating up.  Should i just start pulling capacitors on this rail?  Look forward to your insights as to why this board might not be turning on.  Please let me know if i have missed anything obvious...\nthanks from Scotland,\nWill"}
