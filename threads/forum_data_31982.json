This is also an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board.\n\nSymptoms:\n\n1. Board won't detect hard drive; doesn't show in EFI, and flashing folder appears.\n2. Drive gets power; I can hear the whine of the drive being powered, but no \"ticking\" (data). When I disconnect power, I can hear the typical click-off of drive.\n3. Pin 7 of <CHIP>U4510</CHIP> is 3.3v\n4. <CAPACITOR>C4510</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C4511</CAPACITOR> both look like they've seen significant heat/draw (not shorted, but darker-yellow on the end caps than others)\n5. Board boots to USB drive fine; WiFi, BT, Audio, etc., all work.\n6. Drive not detected in disk utility or System Info, of course.\n7. All resistors measure out fine around <CHIP>U4800</CHIP>/<CHIP>U4510</CHIP>, etc.\n\nSo I suspect some issue with the data connection. I replaced <CHIP>U4510</CHIP>, <CAPACITOR>C4510</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C4511</CAPACITOR>, but no dice. There are lots of data lines related to J4501, so unsure which others I should be looking at."

I might give up on this one, thinking maybe a PCH issue. If you have anything else I should check I will. Thanks so much for the help! This one kicked my ass."

However, maybe it was one of the rare moments some fuse was actually blown by a short circuit."
