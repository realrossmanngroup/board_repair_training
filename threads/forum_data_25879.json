            "message": "Hello, I have a water damage <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that doesn't turn on. Most of the corrosion occurred on J6955 (BIL) and <CHIP>U3280</CHIP> (t29 15v boost regulator). When I was checking the power rails I noticed that the S3 rails are missing. I also noticed that this line beeps to ground when I connect the magsafe. Is this normal? I'm assuming there is something wrong with this line rail is preventing this macbook from turning on. Can someone give me some input; not sure what else to do.\n\nMy voltages are the following:\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.52\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 16.88\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.46\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> 4.95\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 3.29\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> 0\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> 0\n\nThanks,"
