The machine had some liquid, but is not significantly damaged. It is shorted on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2</SIGNAL> and pp3v3_s2_WLBT__ISNS and gets a bit hot seen on thermal cam. Aprox. 40 celcius at UL000, CL022, CL023, RL005 and in the surrounding area. Could it be UL000 that is short-circuited (no cracks, burnings or anything)? I have applied 1v and 0.800 amp directly in <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2</SIGNAL> nothing gets hot. I apologize if I ask a stupid question but I am rookie"
