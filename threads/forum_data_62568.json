The machine had some liquid, but is not significantly damaged. It is shorted on pp3v3_s2 and pp3v3_s2_WLBT__ISNS and gets a bit hot seen on thermal cam. Aprox. 40 celcius at UL000, CL022, CL023, RL005 and in the surrounding area. Could it be UL000 that is short-circuited (no cracks, burnings or anything)? I have applied 1v and 0.800 amp directly in pp3v3_s2 nothing gets hot. I apologize if I ask a stupid question but I am rookie\uf04a"}

If I remove the RD810 I get 20 volt and stable 0.000 amp. I've searched for a similar problem here in forum and found this one - could it be the same issue - U8100 short? I will write the good guy..."}
