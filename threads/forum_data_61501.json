    "definitions": {
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "820_3115": "What is 820_3115? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U4900": "What is U4900? This is the System Management Controller(SMC) in older(pre-2013) macbooks.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",

        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. ."

            "message": "HI there. I have an intermittent issue with this board that I am able to replicate. Currently its pulling 130ma off the charger @18.5V. There was no liquid damage on this board. If I unplug and re-insert the magsafe (off the DC power supply set @19V) over and over, eventually this board will turn on. When it doesnt turn on, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> fluctuates 7-9V, and <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is 0v, all other voltages are within spec. It seems as though it will only turn on with a genuine 85W power supply, and not the 60W. IT will not stay powered on very long running off battery (too low voltage?)\n\nI have replaced:\n<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>\n<CHIP>U4900</CHIP>\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR>\n\nConnecting a genuine 60W magsafe - No boot\nConnecting a genuine 85W Magsafe - Boot\nDC Power supply set @ 16.5V - No boot\nDC Power supply set @ 19V - Boot (but sometimes not)\n\nWhat should I be checking next?"
