I am hoping someone can help me with an issue I'm having with a 2016 A1706. I bought this computer from a guy who turned it on one morning and said he heard a little pop, then a little puff of smoke and a burning smell came out of it and it stopped working. I opened it up to find that a inductor had cracked in half, so I replaced it with the exact component from another board. It still doesn't boot up. I get 20v @ 2.76a. I have track pad click, the fans kick on after it gets hot and it will power USB device, but no image and no start up chime. With power disconnected it seems like most of the components above the CPU Near back of the MacBook are shorted to ground. Also voltages seem off from the schematics. At least in that area. I have attached an image with a circle around the component I have replace. Maybe the CPU is cooked?"}

The reason I was wondering if it\u2019s the embedded GPUis because I found a video where the same MacBook has pretty much the same symptoms and the guy tests using an oscilloscope and shows that the board can\u2019t complete the start up process and gets stuck similar to this board. I also find it strange that nothing else seems to be broken, yet it won\u2019t boot. I will get back to you about getting  5V at C7607."}

Two things that might also be worth mentioning. 1. I only have 3 of the 4 USB post working, as one had a bad pad under it and even after running a jumper, that port is not working at all when you plug anything into it. I was planning on reworking that if the board would be worth the effort, but wasn't sure if it needed to be working right now to at least get the board running. I thought if it was an issue I would not get 20v. Am I wrong there? ... 2. I only have  1.074v on PPVCC_SO_CPU rather than 1.5.  .. It also has an ohms reading of 3.0"}
