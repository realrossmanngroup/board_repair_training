        "message":"Hi Guys.\nWorking on a 820-3115 with no power no green light. Liquid damaged in the U7000 and Q5480 area.\nI replaced both of those components and surrounding caps\/resistors. \nFound a short on PPBUS_G3H that I tracked down to CHGR_PHASE on Q7035, when I removed it the short went away. I also replaced Q7030 & Q7080 for good measure. \nConnected adapter and got green light but PPBUS_G3H was low 6.34V. It slowly went down to 0V and the short returned. \nI replaced U7000 again to rule out bad placement. Same symptoms. \nHere is what I am noticing now....if I test for a short at CHGR_PHASE on Q7035 the short shows for a few seconds then is gone. I also get these results if I test PPBUS_G3H on R5481 as well .It is like the short is \"moving\" from one end of the circuit to the other.\nPPBUS_G3H shows a short then CHGR_PHASE doesn't and vice versa.\nI am stumped. Any suggestions ?"

        "message":"Uhm this is a PPBUS short and has nothing to do with the sponge cap.....\n\nYou need to replace U7000, Q7035\/30 all together at once. But it does sound like the gate of Q7035\/30 has no continuity to U7000 so you can \"activate\" the FET with your multimeter and cause a short because you enabled the FET by measuring on the gate. I suspect corroded trace to U7000."
