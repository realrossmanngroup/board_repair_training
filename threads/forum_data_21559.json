When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

Liquid damaged in the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q5480</TRANSISTOR> area.\nI replaced both of those components and surrounding caps/resistors. \nFound a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> that I tracked down to <SIGNAL>CHGR_PHASE</SIGNAL> on <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>, when I removed it the short went away. I also replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> & <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> for good measure. \nConnected adapter and got green light but <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was low 6.34V. It slowly went down to 0V and the short returned. \nI replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> again to rule out bad placement. Same symptoms. \nHere is what I am noticing now....if I test for a short at <SIGNAL>CHGR_PHASE</SIGNAL> on <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> the short shows for a few seconds then is gone. I also get these results if I test <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> on <RESISTOR>R5481</RESISTOR> as well .It is like the short is \"moving\" from one end of the circuit to the other.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> shows a short then <SIGNAL>CHGR_PHASE</SIGNAL> doesn't and vice versa.\nI am stumped. Any suggestions ?"
