        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",

        "CPUVR_PGOOD_R": "What is CPUVR_PGOOD_R? CPUVR_PGOOD_R is a signal that comes from CPU_VR_EN that is necessary along with ALL_SYS_PWRGD to create PM_S0_PGOOD.",

        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",

        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "PP1V5_S0": "What is PP1V5_S0? PP1V5_S0 is a 1.5v power rail present when the machine is in an S0 working state.",

PP3v42 is present and I have charger light. I narrowed it down to something near <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> I believe which has 3.42v on pin 8 and 0.19v on pin 2 (<SIGNAL>CPUVR_PGOOD_R</SIGNAL>) but nothing on any of the other pins. Can't find any shorts anywhere, its just not getting power. So far I have replaced <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> from a chip off of a doner board but still has same symptoms.. am I missing something?
