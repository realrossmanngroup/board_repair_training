I have pp3v3_s5 and pp5v0_s5 rails but PM_SLP_S5_L is missing on u8170 causing it to be unable to enter into S4 state. PP3v42 is present and I have charger light. I narrowed it down to something near U1950 I believe which has 3.42v on pin 8 and 0.19v on pin 2 (CPUVR_PGOOD_R) but nothing on any of the other pins. Can't find any shorts anywhere, its just not getting power. So far I have replaced U7200 from a chip off of a doner board but still has same symptoms.. am I missing something? I feel like the answer is right in front of me somewhere[\/SIZE][\/FONT][\/COLOR]"}
