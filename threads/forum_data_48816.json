            "message": "Hello\nI recently got an asus x553ma laptop.at first it would boot, but then I found only sometimes it would actually turn on, post and start windows.\nother times it would just turn on as tho it was going to boot but won't.\nI have tried diffirent ran sticks, tried cleaning the ran socket, and looking for physical on water damage or corrosion.\n\nI have not found any signs of water damage.\n\nLast night after trying to get it to boot, it all of a sudden shows no signs of life.\nNo light, no noise from hard drive. Just dead.\n\nI check for shorts on up1589Q and founding was getting hot.\n\nI have another asus laptop much the same, it's a x453ma and it has the same power of, up1589q.\nTried replacing it and it still shows no signs of life\n\nI put the up1589q if inn the x453ma to see if it was dead, and i5s not. The laptop booted.\n\nI have not been able to find schematics for the x553ma only board view.\n\nWas wondering if I could please get some advice on what to try next.\n\nThanks"
