On my USB-C am meter it is showing 19.8V @ .01mA. I am getting P3V3_G3H but not PPBUS. PPBUS_G3H is reading 1.9 Ohms to GND. I take it that is not good. Also, the only signs of liquid is by the battery."}

I tried to run internet recovery and when I try to go to the name of my Wifi, the computer slows way down. one of the times I booted it I got some kind of kernal error but it diisappeared before I could see what it said. What I am wondering is even though I replaced U7430, the CPU might have gotten a small enough zap to render it useless but it still tries to work. I'm just not sure. I am going to keep attempting to either get it to boot from an external OS or get a different SSD."}
