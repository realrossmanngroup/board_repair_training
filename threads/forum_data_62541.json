When I bend the topcase of the laptop only a little bit, the artifacts disappear and black colors are normal. Very little pressure is necessary. When I release pressure, the artifacts appear again. So I guess it is a cold solder joint somewhere on the board. How can I proceed to identify the cold solder joint? Or would you just reflow the whole board?"

            "message": "Hi guys. Thank you for your answers!\n\nYes, I have reworked the LCD connector, with no effect. After that I've tried a reflow of the GPU, which in the beginning appeared to have solved the problem. But it instantly appeared again as soon as I've mounted back the heatsink. Because the heatsink is putting pressure on the board. The problem still disappeared when bending the board a little bit.\n\nI have tested the board outside of the macbook and I could spot an area that reacted to pressure. The image was turning normal only when pressing anywhere in that particular area. But I could not find the exact cold joint. So I decided not to waste too much more time and just to reflow that whole area.\n\nThe good news: I've repaired the artifacts. They are gone and also don't come back when I bend the board. But in one spot delamination appeared. It's called \"popcorn effect\" according to my research. A bubble appeared under one IC close to the battery connector. Now the board is not charging anymore, and I guess it is not repairable. I did this before piernovs answer, and unfortunately he was right, I've killed the board.  ðŸ˜ž \n\nI have read that this can appear because of moisture inside the board. But the macbook was stored in my heated apartment at 50% air moisture for over half a year. So I can not imagine how there could have been moisture inside. Would I still have had to dry the board in an oven before soldering? Probably the temperature I've used was too high. I have used 200Â°C bottom heat and 370Â°C hot air (Quick 861DW). Which is the maximum temperature that I should use on a board?\n\nI know it was stupid reflowing the whole area, I should at least have restricted only to chips related to the graphics circuit. Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn."
