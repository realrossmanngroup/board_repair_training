It's nice and clean now, but a handful of areas were affected I'm trying to work through.\nThe first problem was PP3V42_G3H was shorted. I injected to try and find it... and the board got very hot on the left side and then cleared the short on it's own. Still not sure what exactly caused it. I'm now reading 0.001v, but not shorted.\nGoing through the steps now:\n[URL='https:\/\/logi.wiki\/index.php\/G3_to_S3_State_for_Ivy_Bridge_Haswell_and_Broadwell?fbclid=IwAR2zcWd4iftGrbht-UNMhpTd-9Y8ECmzPHeN91IC4dAdDriSOuFaXspkuZg']https:\/\/logi.wiki\/...\/G3_to_S3_State_for_Ivy_Bridge...[\/URL]\n\nPPDCIN_G3H is 16.2v ... link says it should be 14.5. Is this concerning?\nDCIN_ISOL_GATE_R is 6.8v as it should be.\nCHGR_ACIN is 4.3v instead of 3.3v...\nCHGR_DCIN is also 16.4v, is that too high?"}

Replaced... and I have green light and fan spin. I'll report back if there are further issues. \n\nAs always, thanks :)"}
