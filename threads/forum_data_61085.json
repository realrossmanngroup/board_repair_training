        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",

It's nice and clean now, but a handful of areas were affected I'm trying to work through.\nThe first problem was <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> was shorted. I injected to try and find it... and the board got very hot on the left side and then cleared the short on it's own. Still not sure what exactly caused it. I'm now reading 0.001v, but not shorted.\nGoing through the steps now:\n[URL='https://logi.wiki/index.php/G3_to_S3_State_for_Ivy_Bridge_Haswell_and_Broadwell?fbclid=IwAR2zcWd4iftGrbht-UNMhpTd-9Y8ECmzPHeN91IC4dAdDriSOuFaXspkuZg']https://logi.wiki/.../G3_to_S3_State_for_Ivy_Bridge...[/URL]\n\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> is 16.2v ... link says it should be 14.5. Is this concerning?\n<SIGNAL>DCIN_ISOL_GATE_R</SIGNAL> is 6.8v as it should be.\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> is 4.3v instead of 3.3v...\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> is also 16.4v, is that too high?"
