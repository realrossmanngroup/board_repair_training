            "message": "Hello,\n\nI'm new to macbook repair but after spilling some water on my macbook I did an ultrasonic bath of the motherboard already.\nEverything works fine except after closing lid.\nFrom the schematic, I see that there is 2 hall sensors, but playing with magnets, I can put the mac to sleep only with 1 magnet triggering the sensor on the left.\n\nI've been wanting to dig in a bit by playing with TP for sensor and <SIGNAL>LID_OPEN</SIGNAL> but I'm not sure how to do that cause the test point are not visible when the MB is fixed to the case. Should I just try to plug the battery to the motherboard and nothing else so I can play with <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR</SIGNAL> TP and <SIGNAL>OPEN_LID</SIGNAL> TP?\n\nAlso just to make sure I'm on the right track, the way I understand it:\nCLAMSHELL should be detected as closed if I have LOW signal on both <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_LEFT</SIGNAL>, correct? Meaning if no magnet is applied, those <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSORS</SIGNAL> should yield \"high\" voltage?\nCLAMSHELL should be detected as OPEN if <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT</SIGNAL> OR <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_LEFT</SIGNAL> is HIGH so that <SIGNAL>LID_OPEN</SIGNAL> is high?\n\nThe fact that I can trigger sleep mode with 1 magnet on the left makes me think that somehow <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_RIGHT</SIGNAL> is already low... but what I don't get is, when I remove the magnet, <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_LEFT</SIGNAL> HIGH should be enough for the OR gate to yield <SIGNAL>LID_OPEN</SIGNAL>.\n(Just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly how this should work)\n\nAdditional information: I ran ioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState with an external monitor plugged in and it confirms.\nEverything starts with \"AppleClamshellState\" = No\nThen if I close the macbook \"AppleClamshellState\" = Yes\nThen if I re-open the lid, it stays \"AppleClamshellState\" = Yes\n\nFinal question, is it possible that the problem doesn't come at all from the <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSORS</SIGNAL> or the logics around it? (One repair store told me I needed to change my screen cause the video card might be faulty... But I fail to see how a faulty screen could explain what I'm experiencing with magnets, etc)\n\nThank you"

I still can put my mac to sleep only with left sensor… as if I haven’t changed anything.\n\nI did a few measure and I do have 3.3v on TP <SIGNAL>LID_OPEN</SIGNAL> and TP <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_LEFT</SIGNAL>.\nWith old and new audio flex (only the flex and the board connected with nothing else), I get 0.03v on TP <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT</SIGNAL>.\n\nThere is still a chance that the new audio flex is broken as well, but that led me to think I'm not sure I understand what voltage I'm supposed to get from this sensor.\nBasically when there is nothing connected but the board and the audio flex (+power of course), am I supposed to get high voltage on TP <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT</SIGNAL> (similar to what I'm getting from <SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_LEFT</SIGNAL>) if it's working properly?\n\nBy the way <RESISTOR>R5254</RESISTOR> is supposed to be 1M Ohm but I measure only  200 to 300k... weird.

What haven't I tested already?\n\nBy the way I tried with 2 other audio flex (so 3 new in total) and they hall yield the same problem. No voltage on TP <SIGNAL>SENSOR_RIGHT</SIGNAL>. But strangely if I bootup my computer mic is not working on any of the new audio flex but is working on the old supposedly broken one. \n\nSo either the 3 new audio flex are broken OR there is something weird happening with the Motherboard where with a working audio flex, nothing works..."
