            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> supposedly replaced with a new board a couple of weeks ago. Clear signs board has seen liquid damage and was ultrasonic'd and put back in to service as it probably booted \"then\".\n\nNow the unit will only green/orange light & fan spin. The fan spin runs for about 10 seconds, then stops, then starts again, and about 7~8 minutes later stops completely. LED on USB will flash once on initial power, and then when the fan spins up again after the 10 second lull point but never again.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 8.6V, 3V42 present too. All other rails present that I've bee able to test, including CPU at 1.8V\n\nBubbling corrosion on the tracks for <CHIP>U1930</CHIP> / <RESISTOR>R1931</RESISTOR>, as well as corrosion under <RESISTOR>R8152</RESISTOR>.\n\nProblem might be that <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is being pulled down slightly to 0.98V from 1.05V, I've removed <CHIP>U1930</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R1800</RESISTOR> and the slight pull down still occurs, leaving either the PCB or the CPU causing the slight pull down.\n\nBIOS, SMC, RTC Gen, PCH HSIO Switch ( <CHIP>U8005</CHIP> ) all checked/replaced and appear to be okay.\n\nFeel like I'm missing something blatently obvious."
