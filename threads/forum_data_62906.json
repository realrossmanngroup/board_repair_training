I would unplug the power cable, then plug back in without turning the iMac back on and the fan would spin at full speed again. The client took the iMac home over the weekend, but it powered off on her, and now there is no power.\nHere is what I found. Power supply is good (had known good power supply I swapped). \n\nBack to the motherboard:\nI used a thermal camera and found <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> appeared to be shorting, so I removed this chip and still had shorts on the following pins:\n4,3,21,20,48,46,42,32.\nBecause where these appear to go, <SIGNAL>REG_CPUCORE_VSEN</SIGNAL> being one, does this mean the CPU is fried?\nThank you!"
