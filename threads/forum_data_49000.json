        "820-3662": "What is 820-3662? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD.."

We do have a green and orange light and PPBUS and 3.42 measure OK. If we connect the battery and then plugin the charger, it works. Cannot find a short in the power circuit, kinda weird, any idea?"
