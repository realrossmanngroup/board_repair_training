After doing some testing we found out that the display connected to a working Mac also has the same issue, BUT when the screen was re-installed back on the dropped Mac that Mac now is stuck at 5V.\n\nClean board\nDoes not enter DFU\nNo light on charger\nPPBUS not shorted and 12.3V\n\nI don't know where to take it from here, please be patient."}
