        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
