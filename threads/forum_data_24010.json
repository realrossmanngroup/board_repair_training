Would it ruin christmas if a mid 2011 13\" air display were plugged in?\n\nCurrent status:\n\nI attempted to fire up asd but it hangs on \"loading videocontroller devices\" before fully initializing.\nTried booting into OSX on ext ssd, displays apple and spinning pinwheel loading indicator before hanging. Any ideas come to mind?"}
