        "U7400": "What is U7400? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PP5V_SO": "What is PP5V_SO? PP5V_SO is a typo of PP5V_S0, which is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S0 working state. The person who typed PP5V_SO thought that the S0 in PP5V_S0 was SO, if you see PP5V_SO assume the user made a typo and meant to type PP5V_S0.",

        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
