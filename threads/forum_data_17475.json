        "WS_KBD_ONOFF_L": "What is WS_KBD_ONOFF_L? WS_KBD_ONOFF_L is a signal that comes from the keyboard that tells the SMC that the power button has been pressed.  L means whatever before the L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. This signal directly affects SMC_ONOFF_L.",
