        "message":"Hi\n\nI got this MacBook Pro 15 late 2013 with integrated graphics only\n\nWas a lot dust inside but apart from that board is looking very clean. I cleaned all dust away. No liquid or corrosion or anything like that. \n\nThe problem is that it shuts down intermittently. Sometimes after 5 minutes usage sometimes longer up to 20 minutes. \n\nWhen it does the shut down the image disappears but backlight stays on for 5-10 seconds before it turns off. Then I can push the power button and it starts up again with no sign that it had just crashed. \n\nIt does not store anything in the log files and ASD EFI and OS runs through without failures. The owner claims that it never got hit or  dropped or something like it. \n\nI was wondering if anyone could lead me on the way especially because of the way it crashes with the backlight still on for a little while before shut down. \n\nThanks all"
