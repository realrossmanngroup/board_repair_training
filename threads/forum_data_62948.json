When I plugged it in I can see that it stays around 5.170V and amp goes up to between 0.27 and 0.388 and back to zero again. And it is on a loop like this. When I measured the \nCF505 on  <SIGNAL>PP1V5_UPC1_LDO_CORE</SIGNAL> = 1.5V Stable,\nCF508 on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC1_LDO</SIGNAL> = 3.5V Stable,\nCF500 on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_UPC</SIGNAL> = up and down between zero and 0.2V but it goes up partly and goes donw again partly (I mean partly every 1 second it goes down to zero then goes up 0.1 then zero and 0.11 and back same way down from 02.V)\nCF402 on <SIGNAL>PP1V25_S2</SIGNAL> = between zero and 0.5 (same as CF500)\n<RESISTOR>R8441</RESISTOR> on <SIGNAL>UPC_PMU_RESET_3V3</SIGNAL> = around zeroV\nCC337 on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S2</SIGNAL> = 0.001V\nRF235 on <SIGNAL>UPC1_5V_EN</SIGNAL> = 0.13V\nRF901 on <SIGNAL>USBC1_3V3LDO_EN</SIGNAL> = 0.0V\n\nJust because of these I thought the problem is UF500 but do I miss something else or am I right? Want to check with you guys anyway.\n\nThank you for you help in advance.\n\nEmre"

So Ä± took the board under thermal camera and gave 3.3V to that line and found shorted capacitor. Moved it away. Put the LC710 back measured it again and Yay no shorts anymore and back to live."
