The board only seemed to have liquid on the backlight decoupling caps. So shorted to ground. So I removed the caps to find a crater. Still had a short to ground on ppvout_lcdbcklt, so I injected voltage and internal short near cp601 and cp604. Then proceeded to dig the short out, lots of grinding and cutting later the short is gone. Yay! However, this was shorted lived as still no backlight. Now the confusing stuff.\n\nI have backlight output essentially 51 v on ppvout_lcdbcklt which to me seems like the lcd panel isn't being told to accept the backlight. The screen in question is fine, tested with another board.\n\nAlso don\u2019t have keyboard backlight if that helps.\n\nI have replaced up800 no change. one thing to note i only get about 19mv on up800 pin 4, while comparing with another machine it gets 0.8v. also the i2c data lines are 5.12v\n\nLet\u2019s solve this mystery together.\n\nI would have loved to show pictures but my old microscope gave out and the sd card failed with it. I will do my best to provide pictures going forward.[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE][\/CENTER]"}

I assumed it would be ok as its the same line when i last checked. \nI am about 90% the t-con is good but will check with another one later. \nI also thought ALS might be an issue so i had checked lp670 and have 5 volts on both sides. \nUP 700 seems good as well. \n\nRegarding the camera not working i am unsure however when i power the screen with a different board it has backlight. Also I tried a different screen to check but no change. \n\nWhat's next? \nalso lid open voltage is 1.8"}
