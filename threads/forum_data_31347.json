MagSafe LED green at first then orange.\n\nRe-attached 14 pins of the bottom RAM bay and set off to measuring.\n\nFound <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> to be 9V with the battery attached and 12.6V when the battery was disconnected. Even without battery the unit would not boot though. Fan spin, HDD spin, no chime and no display.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.6 without a battery, 9-9.6V with the battery and 11.4 with a KG battery (climbing to 11.95V or 12.04V)\n\nWhile measuring <CAPACITOR>C7005</CAPACITOR> the Mac shut off instantly and hasn't powered on at all since. Power draw on PSU is 0.005--0.007 amps now.\n\nReplaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, issue persists.\n\nCurrently:\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 0.520V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> = 5.5V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.4V\n<SIGNAL>PPCHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> = 15.85V\n\nResistance <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> pins 27/28 = 23ohm\n\nThis is where it becomes obvious I'm fairly new at this as there are now so many measurements and numbers in my head I am chasing my tail. Need to be put back on the right track, where should I look next?"

            "message": "You must wonder what happened and how you killed it.\n\nIs green light still present? 0.5V on PPBUS would pretty much indicate a short to GND. Check resistance to GND on PPBUS.\n\nThere was nothing wrong in this area to start with. 9V with a battery connected is totally normal if the battery is discharged. You always measure PPBUS without battery and then it should be 12.6. With battery connected it will be at whatever voltage the battery wants it to be for charging."

Could that have done it? Not sure if that's what actually happened but only thing I can think of.\n\nPPBUS resistance to ground is 9 mega ohm and dropping."
