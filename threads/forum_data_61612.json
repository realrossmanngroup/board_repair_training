I got an 820-2936 board here that was not turning on. I fixed it and now it turns on, but sometimes fans go high and machine gets extremely slow. I then decided to run ASD to see if there are any sensor errors. But, neither ASD EFI or ASD OS show me the option to test sensors. It simply won't show up sensors test option on the tests list. Never seen this happen before! Same ASD works ok on another machine, so not DMG problem. Any ideas on what it could be? I'm suspecting maybe BIOS is bad as I had to flash it because costumer had interrupted a system update and corrupted original BIOS."}

Anyway, I flashed mine again and now it shows up sensors on ASD. Palmrest sensor is reading wrong. I tried replacing Trackpad and cable, but same results... Full speed fan and laggy trackpad. I think it may be some communication dateline that's wrong. I'm trying to figure out how palmist temperature measuring works, but cannot find any clues on schematics."}
