This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger.",
