        "message":"Im having a 820-2330 logic board,a1286.\n\nthe problem of the machine is that, it can't charge the battery. it shows \"X\" sometimes and \"0%\" sometimes.\n\nwanted to check those two SMC to u7000 signal and see if they are 3.3v\n\nbut always before those, for this board,once you connect the charger and battery together, it will kill the mosfet q7055.\nI already replaced it twice, same result,once connected, 3 seconds later, you can smell something and it's killed and shorted from D to S.\n\nand yes, tried couple known good battery already.\n\nany advice?\nthank you"
