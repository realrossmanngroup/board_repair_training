SPI termination resistors OK as well. <SIGNAL>PMSLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> was missing, However I replaced the Clk chip and it was restored. ALLSYS Power Good present. \n\n**THIS BOARD HAS NO LIQUID DMG** \n\nThe CPU gets hot as well when it is turned on. \n\nThe board does not chime so I doubt it has a gfx chip issue. \n\nUsb mouse has no light. \n\nThanks for any help provided."
