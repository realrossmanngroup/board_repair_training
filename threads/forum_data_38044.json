            "message": "the macbook had gpu panic issue and some knocked off components i replaced all those components and replaced the polyT capacitor (<CAPACITOR>C9650</CAPACITOR>) with the better poly case cap. it runs fine but when i click on shutdown it will immediately shutdown and restart without me clicking shutdown a second time.\n\nseems to work fine sometimes other times it will shut down and restart randomly by the looks of the board it seems like it was water damaged and worked on before.\n\nupdate: one of the vram chips was chipped and i could see the internals. possibly that is the issue?\n\nupdate2: replaced bad vram and now it wont even get past the apple logo ill just give up on this one."
