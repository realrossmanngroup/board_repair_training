        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "R6905": "What is R6905? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on older Macbooks, pre-2011 models. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",

        "R7273": "What is R7273? a RESISTOR.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
