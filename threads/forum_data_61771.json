        "message":"Hi guys,\nI have a rather unusual question for you. My friend owns a late-2013 MBP which has been infected with some pretty sophisticated malware. We've replaced the SSD with a fresh one and reinstalled Catalina to no avail, so it seems the motherboard itself has been compromised. I've also tried resetting the firmware, NVRAM, and SMC but it still persists. I guess once malware has gotten in at the hardware level it's able to prevent it's own removal.\n\nSo my question - in which parts of the motherboard would something like this be able to hide? Is it technically\/economically feasible to swap out these parts in order to avoid buying a replacement motherboard? Is there anything else I should try before resorting to this?\n\nI've asked this question elsewhere and have been met with incredulity, but we're 100% sure of the presence of the malware. It's sort of an odd story... she has a friend who is a security researcher and he infected her machine as a sort of gag. Each time we've tried to remove it he's been able to prove that he can still monitor her activity. He thinks it's hilarious but it's really driving her crazy.\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!\n\n\nModel details:\n[LIST]\n[*]MacBook Pro 15-Inch \"Core i7\" 2.3 Late 2013 (DG)\n[*]MacBookPro11,3 \/ A1398\n[\/LIST]"

What websites she visits, the things she's working on in Illustrator (she's a graphic designer), etc.\n\nIs there a way to flash the BIOS on a Macbook? My understanding was that firmware updates are performed by the MacOS installer, so I reverted back to an old version of MacOS (Sierra, I believe) and then upgraded back to Catalina. The idea was to revert to an old firmware, and then the Catalina installer would flash it to the latest version. Is there a way to perform firmware updates manually?\n\nOtherwise, I guess what I was asking was whether it's possible to acquire a used firmware chip and have a local repair shop replace it directly on the board. Is that even feasible?"

She thinks it will only make things worse and we're not sure how to definitively prove it without a very expensive and lengthy forensics process. If she could afford that she'd just buy a new laptop.\n\nCan anyone recommend any openly available tools to flash a Macbook Pro firmware? Is any special equipment necessary to do this? Also, does Apple provide official firmware binaries somewhere? I can't seem to find any."
