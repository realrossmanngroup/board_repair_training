Not sure how many more attempts I can do before I rip at least one away.\n\nI am suspecting the Shorted Cap I measured. So I lifted up the NoMarking BGA IC and the short has gone. Measuring on the pads of that IC I get 27Ohm. Isn't that too low to be across a cap?\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60521[/ATTACH]\nI could not find any other schematic which is not in BVR format to try to identify this chip (Still can't justify buying flexbv).\nI have this unknown chip around all the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s, and the caps around do not have such low impedance. May be related? This part of the board had lots of corrosion around the UBS-C connector, while none was on this side of the board.\n\nMoved that Resistor to measure its value, and is measuring 0Ohm when not connected while pads don't measure short."

Not sure if anybody else experienced it.\n\nIt goes 0V->5V 0.2A->20 0.1A (for short time) and back to 0V again when board is not connected to battery. Repeats it multiple times and stops at 20V 0.05A.\n\nWonder if anybody else experienced this?\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong but most of the time blown elc180 for the SSDvoltage also blows NANDS. Check if there is any short on the board, NANDs should be in the 60Ohm spectrum.\nYou can probe around big coils first, then gradually move to smaller ones and cap lines. If you follow the power rails on the schematic could be clear, but more time-consuming."
