When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

It can run from battery but when attaching the charge cable no light. When removing the battery I get orange light and working fine. So it only doesnt work when both AC and battery are connected. No obvious liquid damage on the board. Also tried with another good battery same."
