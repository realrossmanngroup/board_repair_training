When I plug my chargers in I get no light at all and no fan spin even after plugging in a know good io board/cable.

A few of those discolored probe points were around the SMC and <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> and other places.\nThere is no voltage on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> or <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and no short to ground on either of those lines.
