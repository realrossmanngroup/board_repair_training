It has been to another repair shop who offered a logic board replacement. Only thing I noticed when taking apart was that the WiFi card was a little bit looser than normal when taking it out of socket connector. Probably because the other repair shop had taking the card in and out a thousand of times. I replaced the connector but problem is the same."
