        "message":"This board had some minor water damage by the lid sensor causing the computer to randomly sleep. That's repaired. The only issue with it now is that the webcam is not recognized. I installed a known-good board and the webcam itself works fine. Here are my diode measurements for the connector (with webcam attached) for the bad board.

L3507 has continuity through it on both sides. I replaced the connector on the board. I'm stuck with this. Any ideas for this would be appreciated.[\/FONT]"
