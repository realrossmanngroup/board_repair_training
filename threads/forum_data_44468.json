        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "R5280": "What is R5280? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",
