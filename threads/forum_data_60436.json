I was like what?! never heard that before. I checked it out and asked for history and he said his daughter was using it and it just stopped working. I powerd it on and the BL is not working but is will boot to Apple logo but gets stuck on an empty progress bar. I took the board out and U7701 definitely suffered liquid damage as well as the resistors to the right of it. U3210 has a tiny bit of dried stuff above it. My question is, neither one of these could cause the LB not to load the OS correct? I looked the whole board under MS and do not see liquid on the PCH side or by U6100."}
