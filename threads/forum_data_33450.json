            "message": "hello, got this machine as liquid spill around the battery connector\n\n\n\nthe board dont looked nasty or something like that , only on the battery connector on battery side the markers are red and that one on the left top corner of the board, on that side where battery connector is\n\n\nafter press power button comes the red battery on the sceen, hats all.\n\ni connected a good battery and it is working and charging , everything fine.\n\nso i cleaned the board only with alcohol and set it back in the unit. after that it dont turn on. i heated with 100 grad celsius the area of the battery connector, after that it turn on one time.\n\nnow it dont turn on. no green light\n\ni found 2 wholes in <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, replaced that,\n\nat first i found F7005 blown, after replaceing and blown again i found <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7135</TRANSISTOR> are bad, replaced now.\n\nnow i have almost back my green/orange light.\n\nbut only 12.20V on L7130\n\nso i checked the SDA and SCL lines of the smc, SDA line has 3.3V changing on oszyloscope it shows trafic\n\non the SCL line are only 1.7V, resistor ok and before resistor are 3.3V\n\n\nthe lines both have in diode mode somthing of .487\n\nso i replaced <DIODE>D7050</DIODE> ad have now on SCL 3.03 V but in oszyloscope only a flat line.\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is 3.3V\n\nreplacing SMC needfull? or some other ideas? need help please"
