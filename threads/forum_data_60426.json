        "message":"Hello,\nThis originally had liquid damage on and around the lvds backlight capacitors (C8469..)\nI first cleaned the board, it was dead prior, after cleaning it was turning on but no backlight.\nI replaced the bad looking capacitors and it showed backlight. I cleaned the board again to remove the flux but after cleaning it was back to no backlight.\n\nThere is no short on PPVOUT and i couldn't find broken traces.\n\nQ8400 \nPin3 - 12.59V\nPin4 - 12.49V\nRest - 0V\n\nBKLT_EN_R - 3.3V\n\nAm I understanding correctly that U8400 has to pull down LCDBKLT_EN_L in order to turn on the backlight? And if so why it doesn't?\n\nThere was no damage on U8400 originally."

It turned out that the BKLT_SD trace was partly broken. I have no idea how it measured good when I first checked for continuity but the probe point on R8402 turned out to be corroded. Honestly, it was nearly invisible and when I scraped the coating it was still connected.. \nI've reconnected the probe point to the trace leading to R8402 and it works.\n\nThanks for the help!"
