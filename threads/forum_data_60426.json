        "820-01598": "What is 820-01598? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8400": "What is U8400? a CHIP.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "C8469": "What is C8469? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q8400": "What is Q8400? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "I2C_BKLT": "What is I2C_BKLT? I2C_BKLT is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",

        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT is PPBUS_G3H backlight voltage entering the backlight boost circuit once the transistor has been told to allow it through. .",
