I just received one that some office apple reseller told them was liquid damaged, but I didn't find anything that would indicate that. I don't have the MagSafe charger the client forgot to bring it, but when plugged in with type c 87W mac charger goes to 20v but no picture no fan spin. No shorted lines nothing heating up, checked also on the thermal cam. \n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks :)"}
