I'm using the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01041</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> schematic also as it appears to be the same as this board, <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01326</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. Anyway, i get PP20V and current pull when battery is connected, indicating battery charge and no current with battery removed. I'm still a bit rusty with these newer macbook's and the power sequence. Only thing i've found so far is \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> at 0v \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_AWAKE</SIGNAL> - 3.3v.\n\nShouldn't <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> be at 3.3 as well since AWAKE is up? Any suggestions on what to check."
