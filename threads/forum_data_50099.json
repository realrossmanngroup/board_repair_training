This computer (on battery only) turns on and boots, but only will stay on for about a minute before it crashes. I have tried multiple batteries.\n\nThe same computer will turn on and boot and STAY on if it plugged into charger.\n\nPPBUS while on battery stays steady 7.95V during and after the crash.\n\nThanks!\n\n\nALSO - I think customer using chinese charger."
