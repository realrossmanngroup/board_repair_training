Corrosion on <CHIP>U7230</CHIP> and UA750 as well. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> shorted to ground and found out <CHIP>U7230</CHIP> sent the voltage to the CPU.\n\nI just want to make sure the CPU is indeed fried. I currently have 20 volts 0 amps on the charger (why 0?). I already replaced the MOSFETS and now <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is no longer shorted to ground. Currently I have 0 volts on all coils with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> / GPU @ 12.6 volts. If CPU is fried, could vCore still exist?"
