        "message":"Hi,\nI have here a late 2011 untouched Mainboard. Customer told me he had problems with the GPU and they switched off the gpu. of course a external moniotor is not possible and preferences shows only intel gpu.\n\nMachine is working good, the rotating donat is showing up as well.\n\nI want now to replace the GPU by a good one. So can me send someone a good clear me BIOS?\n\nI load up the \"original\" bios. By starting with the ALT-Key its needfull to enter a password, the password is \"gpu\" \n\nCan someone explain me that thing? what they did with the bios?\n\nthe bios file you can download here : [url]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1PirfNkIACQ-ctVw-OKiCuCgZDF4G1pWj[\/url]\n\nRegards\nUwe."
