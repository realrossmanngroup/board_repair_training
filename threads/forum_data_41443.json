Now i am a little lost with this... nothing unusual.\nMBP <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1297</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2914</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A. Red bull definatly did not give it wiings. Keyboard naffed. Green LED on magsafe. No power. Motherboard surprisingly clean and dry. no corrosion visible across the board even under the scope. The was sticky residue on pins 1-4 of the LVDS connector, cleaned with flux and touched up with new solder. Still no power. Removed the board and started testing the power rails.... this is what I have so far:-\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.57V\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTER_ISNS</SIGNAL> 12.57V\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_H3_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL> 12.57V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 17.04V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.48V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.323V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> UNABLE TO LOCATE ON THE \"NET\" COMMAND\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> 0.0V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_ISNS_R</SIGNAL> 0.0V\nPP5V-S0 0.0V\nand following down the list of power rails becomes obvious the board is devoid of 5v\n\nNow looking at the board view there is listed components in the location UD300 where going by the schematic I have should be 5v points. there is not a single component there. Not unduly worried as there is o solder there either.\n\nMaybe I have gone letter blind but I can seem to find on the schematic the first instance of where 5v feed should be. I have gone away, had a cup of tea, come back and still unable to located where 5v first emerges. Would anyone be king enough to point me to where or what produces the 5v"

            "message": "[USER=\"682\"]2informaticos[/USER] see, this is why you get the big bucks for the big jobs.... you hit the nail on the head with the adapter. customer gave me a 60w and swears blind this is what they have been using, used a 85w adapter and powers on. get the chime and an apple logo on the screen but no illumination. with the original screen, I can see lines as though the GPU is failing. Tried a known good screen and although no illumination, shining a torch through the apple logo on the lid there are no green lines. This would indicate either a screen or cable issue.However, I wanted to make sure so I want to get the screen to light up. So again, I have attempted to troubleshoot... and I know I am going to be told I am wrong but here goes.\nJ9000 pins 2&3 no voltage. Traced back through <CAPACITOR>C9002</CAPACITOR>->L9000-><CAPACITOR>C9001</CAPACITOR>-><CAPACITOR>C9012</CAPACITOR>-><CAPACITOR>C9011</CAPACITOR> to pins 4&5 on  <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>= no voltage. Checked pins 2&3= 3.322v. Pin 1= no voltage. Followed <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> to <RESISTOR>R9678</RESISTOR>= no voltage. <TRANSISTOR>Q9607</TRANSISTOR> pins 1&4 GND pin 2= 3.317v pin 3= 2.653v pin 5= no voltage pin 6= no voltage. <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> is getting warm but can comfortably leave my finger there without getting burnt ( technical scientific testing there, doesn't burn= not hot...LOL). Other end of J9000 pins 38/39/40= no voltage. at <CAPACITOR>C9008</CAPACITOR> there is no voltage. Tracing <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> at <DIODE>D9701</DIODE> pin 2/ XWD150 pin 1/ <RESISTOR>R9708</RESISTOR> pin 1/ <CAPACITOR>C9717</CAPACITOR> pin 1/ <CAPACITOR>C9716</CAPACITOR> pin 1/ <CAPACITOR>C9718</CAPACITOR> pin 1 all have no voltage. <DIODE>D9701</DIODE> pin 1= no voltage. <CAPACITOR>C9712</CAPACITOR>/13 also have no voltage at pins 1. there is no voltage at L9710. I have looked on boardview and can not locate <RESISTOR>R9700</RESISTOR> but there is a XW9700 which is local to <TRANSISTOR>Q9806</TRANSISTOR>. XW9700 is not on the board. Pins 1/2/5/6 of <TRANSISTOR>Q9806</TRANSISTOR> have no voltage. Pin 4 which goes via a fuse to <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is reading 0.800v the same as  on pin 2 of F9800 and pin 1 is 12.57v. Replaced the fuse and instantly popped. \n\nSo in essence, replacement screen and/ or cable required. Keyboard required. Further I go into the board, the more issues I find. Cost of replacement logic board is £400, replacement lid is £250 and keyboard is £15 without labour costs. Replacement <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1297</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> same spec is £550. Even if I buy the replacement and just swap his HDD and charge £50 labour it's going to work out more benificial, especially as there may be further issues along the line. Plus I have told him he will have a spare HDD, RAM and a battery. I think this is the way he will go.\n\nI hate it when something gets the better of me, and I am sure someone better versed at repairing the logic boards will be able to repair quicker, so far I have spent in excess of 4 hrs and still no further.\n[USER=\"682\"]2informaticos[/USER] as I have said to you many times before, thanks for your assistance and it is greatly appreciated."
