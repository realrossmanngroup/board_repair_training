Nothing much to note in terms of damage on the board. Owner says another place looked at it and said it needed new U5620. The part itself looks OK and diode mode checking each pin on the ic readings look OK. I know that when the fan spins fast the computer will speed up the fan which I have found to be something isn't being seen by the computer. Has anyone to any idea off what it could be?\nThanks"}

I connected just power and got fan spin then it got a lot faster just like it does. With that happening, doesn't that say it isn't anything to do with mouse and keyboard seen as they aren't even connected?"}
