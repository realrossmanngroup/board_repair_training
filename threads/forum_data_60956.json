Flex cable is easy to find but replacement board is either available in US or China(I'm in UK) and they quite pricy. I would like to try simply replace the FPC connector but can't seem to find any reference\/model etc that would allow me to source it\nIs it same as some other connectors from boards that are more available so that I could perhaps transplant it?\nCheers"}
