            "message": "Hi got this Macbook Air 2018\nThe flex cable and the FPC connecter on the little audio board are burned. Flex cable is easy to find but replacement board is either available in US or China(I'm in UK) and they quite pricy. I would like to try simply replace the FPC connector but can't seem to find any reference/model etc that would allow me to source it\nIs it same as some other connectors from boards that are more available so that I could perhaps transplant it?\nCheers"
