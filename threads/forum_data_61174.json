        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "R7110": "What is R7110? a RESISTOR.",
        "C7111": "What is C7111? a CAPACITOR.",
        "D7010": "What is D7010? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year retina model macbook pros, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. ."

If I let the board resting for a minute or so with no power applied and no battery connected the 60W charger works on the first and sometimes second time I plug it in. Then it dies and I have 0V on F7005. Verified/replaced <RESISTOR>R7110</RESISTOR>/7111, same result. Replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, same. Reflowed SMC, same. Replaced <CAPACITOR>C7111</CAPACITOR> also just in case, same. What could it be?"
