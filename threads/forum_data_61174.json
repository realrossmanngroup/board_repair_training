Got this board here with strange symptom. It sometimes charges with 60W charger, but most of times not. If I plug an original 85W charger it will always charge. If I let the board resting for a minute or so with no power applied and no battery connected the 60W charger works on the first and sometimes second time I plug it in. Then it dies and I have 0V on F7005. Verified\/replaced R7110\/7111, same result. Replaced U7100, same. Reflowed SMC, same. Replaced C7111 also just in case, same. What could it be?"}
