Machine enters a S0 state.  Tries to power on but the PPVCC_S0_CPU voltage is 1.7 not 1.8v so it is just sitting there.\nLooking at the schematics I am not sure how it regulates voltage.  I am suspecting U7200 but I don't trust that.  \n\nCPU resistance is normal 10 ohm and does not appear to be the cause. \n\nI would appreciate some guidance in this area."}
