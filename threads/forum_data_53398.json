The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

            "message": "My first post , Hi to all you nice people :)\nplease bare with me I am a total newbie at this . I tried to find similar posts to find a solution but couldnt .\nI have 4 boards with exactly the same problem , at least the symptoms are exactly the same .\nNo liquid damage and no corrosion whatsoever. They all start and come up to 1.5A and after 3 seconds drop down to 0v and that repeats all the time . I am guessing you all will say the cpu is dead but still maybe someone have some other idea ?  The boards are three 3787 and one 3662. They all have fanspin and green and orange light. They have no chime and with a usb mouse plugged in it briefly flashes and turnes off in the same pace as the boards go down to 0v. Please tell what measurements you need to make a diagnose or point me in the right direction . All if any help is highly apreciated .
