After some digging I found a short on PP3V42_G3H because of C5002. after replacing it I now get G3H rails but I am not getting a chime or image. Is it safe to assume the SMC took a shot in the face and is dead? This board was reported to have suffered a liquid event but I didn't notice anything significant. I tried a couple other LCD displays to marule out the display being fried. I also get no USB activity"}
