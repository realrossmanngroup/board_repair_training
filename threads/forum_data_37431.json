No response when I plug in a USB keyboard. No lights. 1.85V on CPU vcore and .850V on GFX vcore. 3.4V on SMC_LID. To make sure I wasn't missing something I tried it with a known-good test screen. No video. 0V on L8300. I've never had to fight this battle with board before. Is there something that gives out with these boards?"}
