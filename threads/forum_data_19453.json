            "message": "This is for a MBA 11\". I have a new TP for a MBA 11\". The function keys don't work, just \"error chime\". The seller of the TP said this is to be expected for a new oem part... well here is what they said. I was wondering if anyone knows about this.\n\n\"[I]Thanks for getting in touch! What you're describing is expected behavior for a new OEM part. Please netboot the unit while connected to your local AST 2 server, and run Trackpad Keyboard Mapper to write the appropriate regional information to the device firmware. For additional details, please reference GSX article TP1016.\"[/I]\n\nIs this only for certified Apple technicians?"
