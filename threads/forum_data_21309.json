Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost."

            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3435</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-b. voltage is 8.6 on backlight line where the boost signal should be sent to.\nthe ic is getting voltage in, the enable signal is present, the voltage divider resistors test as normal, the voltage on the dividers is also what it should be.\nthe chip was burnt and there was dirt underneath, and the feedback pad was burnt. my question is, will the chip fail to send the boost signals if the feedback pad is missing, and if so, would i jump that to pin 2 of the diode (on the side where the boost signal is sent of course) in order to fix the issue?\nalso, on the same note, please correct me if i am wrong, but the mosfet on the same line, its function  is to allow the 8.6v from <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> to pass through or not pass through, this is correct, right?"
