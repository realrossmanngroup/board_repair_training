        "C7050": "What is C7050? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for battery current sensing, you should measure around 2.202 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

            "message": "Hey guys, just diving in to board level laptop repairs here, I purchased a dead water damaged Macbook Air and also this Retina 13in to begin my learning quest. Macbook Air was repaired after hours and hours of watching Louis's videos which I'm absolutely stoked about! Thanks Louis! But now this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3476</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board is giving me issues. So I'm here to get some pointers hopefully..\n\nFirstly the laptop would not power, no orange, no green lights. Dead in every aspect. Found some minor corrosion around <CAPACITOR>C7050</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7060</CAPACITOR>. Replaced <CAPACITOR>C7060</CAPACITOR> and cleaned the rest in the ultrasonic. Now I have orange and green lights and the fans spin so I reassembled into laptop.\n\nAlthough I get the orange light and fans come on I still get no chime and nothing on the screen. After a couple mins the fan starts going extreme.\n\nI then started measuring power rails, everything is present.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on where I should start looking now? I feel like I was making progress in my learning here but have hit a pretty big wall and am stumped basically.\n\nGoing to study the way the LCD works over lunch and see if that can give me some insight otherwise any pushes in the right direction would be lovely!\n\nThanks\nRob"

No there is no question mark folder (LCD doesn't seem to even show a backlight) and when I plug in a USB mouse it lights up for half a second.\n\nI have started from scratch again, testing the one wire circuit and power rails. Now please correct me if I'm wrong or if my thinking is way off track. I think my learning curve is just starting to rise now..\n\n<CHIP>U7090</CHIP> Pin 6 vin should be 3.42v right? It gets it from <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> which has 14.5v on pin 1, pin 2 and pin 3, the 3 resistors <CAPACITOR>C7092</CAPACITOR> <CAPACITOR>C7091</CAPACITOR> <CAPACITOR>C7090</CAPACITOR> all make sure <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> gets the correct 3.42v?\n\nMy VIN on PIN 6 of <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> is still the 14.5v measured from <DIODE>D7005</DIODE>. So do I have a part that isn't pulling the voltage down to 3.42v? Is <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> not doing its job?"
