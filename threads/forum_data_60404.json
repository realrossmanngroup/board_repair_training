I noticed that <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is missing so i checked the needed rails and found <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> beeing low (0.22V).\nSo I checked where <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> (resp. PPCPUVCCIO_S0_REG) is created and found <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR>.\nI coudl measure the fallowing voltages for <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR>:\nPin         Voltage\n1/2            8.4\n3               0.28\n4               0.26\n5                 0\n6/7/8       0.22\n\nCan anybody help me with some hints for further steps?\n\nThank you and best regards\ndudipupan"
