It beeps without RAM, but that's the only sign of life. Will not start in SMC bypass mode, or after SMC reset - I've never seen it running. I tried to flash the BIOS chip with known good one (with clean ME) for <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, but nothing changed (so I flashed back the old one). There were no signs of spills, oxidation or previous repairs. It looks to me like dead CPU? I've got one CPU for <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> on stock, so I can change it, but I'm not sure if it's really dead when it still beeps without RAM... Also why would it die?

After changing <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> the <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> came back, but that's all. \n\nIt beeps even with different BIOS, I tried one downloaded BIOS for <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and one from a known working <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board - still the same. Without RAM it's just one long beep that repeats after a few seconds. \n\nI tried all possible configurations of RAM and about 4 different tested working pairs with different frequencies (12800, 10600, L, non-L...), but it's always the same - with any RAM in any slot it's quiet, without RAM it beeps."
