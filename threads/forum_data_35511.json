Partition is unrecoverable. I have tried EasUS and Disk Drill so far. My question is, is it possible for a board or cable to be causing this recurring problem? I have replaced the drive 3 times like i said. Thanks for any help in advance."}

[url]https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/XXqigPwwqYZorZ773[\/url]\n\nLike I said this is the third hard drive I have changed for this customer in a years time and I am getting suspicious of what could be the cause. :confused: So I thought I would run it by you guys. It is possible that its something they are doing. I know that their kid uses it but they swear that it just sits on a desk and he is very careful.\nGood idea on switching them to SSD, I may just do that. I have heard of Diskwarrior I just never bit the bullet on paying the 120 for it. If its that much better than all the free stuff then I may as well do that also. \n\nThanks again for the replies and have a great day!"}

You either have bad luck or you are getting crap drives from someone or this guy is knocking this thing around. Swap a SSD in there and then in 3 months he will be back with a dead GPU."}
