The board is requesting19.69v and draws about 0.180mA then goes to about 0.355mA. After about 10 seconds or so from the charger being plugged in and the amp draw increasing to 0.355mA it goes back down to 0.000 then goes back up to 0.355mA and hangs there. The CPU is warming up after a minute or 2 while the charger is connected. USB mouse also gets power if that somehow helps?\n\nI measured L7210 with my multimeter and it reads 0.95v and doesn’t come down.\n\nnot sure what to do. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nboard isn’t liquid damaged either."
