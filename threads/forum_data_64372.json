MacBook Pro <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2141</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> - <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> where charging is working perfectly on all 4 ports but USB 2.0 / USB 3.0 devices are not working. I have a USB Flash Drive that have both USB A and Type C connectors, Type C would work, but USB A does not. Any tips on how to troubleshoot this?"
