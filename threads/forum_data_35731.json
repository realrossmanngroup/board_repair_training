On a external monitor it works normally and also recognizes the internal screen. If i look closely i can see that the LCD backlight is activating in the moment as the keyboard backlight turns on (same second the apple logo finishes loading on the external monitor) I can also close it and open it back up and the backlight tuens right back on. I can also turn LCD backlight brightnes up and down manually in the OS. I tried 2 other LCDs (not new ones - i took them a while ago from dead devices but at least one of them should show any reaction i think) and i get the same issue on both. I measured 5.11V on L8300. Now i am stuck."
