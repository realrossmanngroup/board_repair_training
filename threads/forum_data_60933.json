I'm presuming this is a dead SSD and assuming this is there any possibility of swapping the chip out with one from another board with a dead CPU or do these require special programming like iPhones? I've done quite a few iPhone 7 NAND replacements and also even fixed one of the HP Streams with a dead SSD before so am confident I can swap the chip successfully!"}

I had one case where I wasn't able to erase SSD from macOS (Disk Utility or from Terminal) but after erasing the beginning with dd from Linux, I was able to format and reinstall macOS without issue.\n\nRemember that working on these boards isn't the best idea as CPU can die anytime anyway and customer will blame your work\u2026"}
