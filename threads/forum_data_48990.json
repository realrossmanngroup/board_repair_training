This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",

If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

I noticet that the cpu is getting slightly warm after some time (i guess thats because <SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0_CPU_VCCPLL_R</SIGNAL> are there but <SIGNAL>VCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>VCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3RS0</SIGNAL> are missing). I checked powerrails and came to a point where i got stuck. <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3</SIGNAL> is the first rail thats missing. So i followed it and as far as i understand it that is how it works: \n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3</SIGNAL> (missing) is created by <CHIP>U7300</CHIP>. It needs <SIGNAL>DDRVTT_EN</SIGNAL> as enable (that is missing too). <SIGNAL>DDRVTT_EN</SIGNAL> = <SIGNAL>MEMVTT_EN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>MEMVTT_EN</SIGNAL> needs <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> to be present at <TRANSISTOR>Q2810</TRANSISTOR>. <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is also missing.\nHere it confuses me. As far as i know VCORE comes up first and <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> after that as the CPU creates it. VCORE is missing on this board and <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PGOOD</SIGNAL> enables VCORE. But <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PGOOD</SIGNAL> needs <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3</SIGNAL> (the missing rail from the beginning) and i am back where i startet.\nSo there is some point where i didn?t understand the power on sequence correctly..."
