        "message":"Hello,\nthis 820-3032 is dead. I noticet that the cpu is getting slightly warm after some time (i guess thats because PPVCCSA_S0_CPU, PP1V05_S0 and PP1V8_S0_CPU_VCCPLL_R are there but VCORE_S0_CPU, VCORE_S0_AXG and PP1V5_S3RS0 are missing). I checked powerrails and came to a point where i got stuck. PP1V5_S3 is the first rail thats missing. So i followed it and as far as i understand it that is how it works: \nPP1V5_S3 (missing) is created by U7300. It needs DDRVTT_EN as enable (that is missing too). DDRVTT_EN = MEMVTT_EN and MEMVTT_EN needs PLT_RESET_L to be present at Q2810. PLT_RESET_L is also missing.\nHere it confuses me. As far as i know VCORE comes up first and PLT_RESET_L after that as the CPU creates it. VCORE is missing on this board and ALL_SYS_PGOOD enables VCORE. But ALL_SYS_PGOOD needs PP1V5_S3 (the missing rail from the beginning) and i am back where i startet.\nSo there is some point where i didn?t understand the power on sequence correctly..."

        "message":"Thank you.\nR7402 iscorrect 91.1 kOhm (should be 90.9 kOhm)\nU7801 has no voltage at pin 1 (VIN) and pin 5.\nC7205 pin 1 is not connected to C7801 pin 1 as it should be (not beeping). So i think that that could be one problem here as these two should be directly connectet according to BV and schematic.\nSo i guess i need to run a wire there.\nPP1V5_S3_P1V5S3RS0_FET is missing completely and shorted to GND (C7345 pin 1 beeping and just 4 Ohms to GND. And the resistance of my probes is already 3 Ohms...). Should i inject 1 V (max.1.3 V if nothing happens) there and pray that something heats up?"

I set it to 1.5 V and 5.3 A (max) and if i turn it on voltage drops to 0.7 V  and current stays at 5.3 A cause its current limited. CPU and PCH stay cool as metal. Nothing really gets warm...
