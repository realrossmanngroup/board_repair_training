It's getting power because it's letting power through, but I can't tell if its a buck converter afterward or the chip itself. The schematic is very confusing PAGE 43 which I'll include but I don't know where to check now.\n\nThere has been no history of drop damage or water. But when opened by my colleague he ripped the cables on the machine I replaced all of the cables and the original problem was that the keyboard wasn't working now trackpad doesn't work either."
