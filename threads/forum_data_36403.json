I'm going to check backlight fuse but I was hoping it would show up on external display yet now I'm thinking it won't until login. Just like my 2015 which won't turn on external display sometimes until login. This has become an issue since Sierra!  So I'm just looking for advice or if anyone has had something similar happen.  If I can be honest I don't really ask for much and just keep paying the monthly to have more \"friends\".  LOL"
