        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

            "message": "This board came back in for a warranty repair, the initial problem was surge damage no power after the storm. <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> was badly burned as well as <RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR> and the traces to pins 16,17, and 18 of U700 had to be replaced with wires. The problem is now the system does not see a battery inside the OS, when the BIL is connected the green light turns off on the charger. The computer will not stay on when the MagSafe is disconnected while in the OS, the screen goes dark however the fans continue to spin as though it was on.\n\nJ6950 Voltages With Battery Connected:\n\nPin 1: 0.008 v\nPin 2: 0.007 v\nPin 3: 0.007 v\nPin 4: 3.449 v\nPin 5: Bounces around never gets higher than 0.063 v\nPin 6: 3.449 v but cycles down to around 0.1 v\nPin 7: 12.26 v\nPin 8: 12.26 v\nPin 9: 12.26 v\n\nJ6950 Without Battery:\n\nPin 1: 0 v\nPin 2: 0 v\nPin 3: 0 v\nPin 4: 3.457 v\nPin 5: 0 v\nPin 6: Same as with the battery connected however the peak is 3.457 v\nPin 7: 12.34 v\nPin 8: 12.34 v\nPin 9: 12.34 v"
