The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

            "message": "Hey everyone\n\nThis device came in with the regular <SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL> short to ground, I first suspected <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> so I removed it but the short did not go away.\nAfter lifting up and soldering back 2 other chips (I think around <CHIP>U4450</CHIP>) I finally found the suspect on the other side of the board: <CHIP>U4700</CHIP>.\n\nAfter replacing <CHIP>U4700</CHIP> and placing on a new <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> the board has AON and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> as well as the other G3H voltages (<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_G3H_LDO</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPVBUS_E85</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>).\nIt did not go further then S5. I tried powering on the device by shorting <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> to ground as I was not sure if this device powers on by default. I used <RESISTOR>R5115</RESISTOR> which is a little pad almost underneath the battery connector (Thats the right one, right?)\n\nJust to confirm I was not just being dumb I placed the machine back together but with no luck, the power button didn't boot it ether.\nAfter taking the device apart again <SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL> was shorted again, which I directly traced back to the replaced <CHIP>U4700</CHIP>. I replaced it once again (why do they die so easily?) with a new one and we're back at no S4. (But we do have S5)\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: OK\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>: 3.28V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3H_LDO</SIGNAL>: 4.98V\n<SIGNAL>PPVBUS_E85</SIGNAL>: OK\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>: OK\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>: 3.28V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL>: 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL>: 0V\n\nOne weird thing I have to mention is that at some point <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> was steady at about 4.2V (not just stray capacitance as it did go to 0V when disconnecting the power) even though all the S0/S3/S4 voltages were not there. Not sure if its important but it was definitely odd.\n\nWhere to look? Thanks!"

Also want to guess how fried this board is? The whole pin layout on J4700 is a big fat failure with high voltage pins right next to low voltage ones, shitty engineering. Anything on 5V1 line is suspect at this point."

Especially <CHIP>U4700</CHIP> loves to die.\nI'm assuming that right now _AON is too low and the device is not communicating with the charger which is keeping it at 5V\n\nHonestly I feel like this board is a goner, probably some other chip is dying or some internal connection is going bad, but with everything being BGA and quite densely packaged I feel like this is just not worth the time.\n\nAny advice on getting data off it? Or is that also close to impossible?"
