I cleaned it off and cannot see too much in terms of obvious damage after the cleaning. When plugged in with either battery, charger, or both, the fans spin but otherwise there are no signs of life. Measuring <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> gives us about 12.5V, which I know is kind of low from the 13.1V on the schematic. Am I correct in saying that this indicates a short that is pulling down that power rail somehwere on the board? Also, any opinions or advice on where to look first? I am not too familiar with these newer model macbooks."

However, the USBs work for charging, but do not get image external on any USB-C ports using HDMI adapter. I have had time to further troubleshoot the board after hand/sonic cleaning and have found the following results:\n\nWith charging cable or battery, PPBUS tests fine and the fans stutter after a couple of seconds then begin spinning properly. Went through the entire board and all of the power rails seem to be active, but maybe Im not understanding the power on sequence of this computer. Some of my more interesting measurements are as follows (sorry if some info is not relevant, as I am new to this):\n\n12.6V on PPBUS\n3.3V on <RESISTOR>R6928</RESISTOR> pins 1 and 2\n<RESISTOR>R0605</RESISTOR> is 0.905k ohms (seems a little low from 1k?)\nPin 2 of <RESISTOR>R0605</RESISTOR> is 0V and pin 1 is 1V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3</SIGNAL> is 1.203V on pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C7930</CAPACITOR>\n5V at pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C7651</CAPACITOR>\n0.9V on pin 1 of CA128\n3.3V on pin 1 of RA330\n3.3V on pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C4520</CAPACITOR>\n3.3V on pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C3919</CAPACITOR>\n\nSome light exposure to moisture on left side right above GPUc, and <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> looked rough but not bad after cleaning. Some on the bottom portion of board by main charging IC. Regular water was dropped on top of the keyboard and alot on the touchbar itself, which may have shorted it out. Bottom of board actually looked okay and had minimal  exposure, if any. I can attach some photos."
