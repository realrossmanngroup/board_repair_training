Even looked at MacBook where board came out!\nUnit powers on boots and operates normally.\ngreen light goes orange.  Machine indicates that the battery is charging and properly recolonizes that the battery is present. \nUnit will operate from battery.  Battery currently shows 87% and seems to stay there.  (I am currently draining it to test)\ncurrent draw does not indicate charging. (300 ish mA)  when running. \n\nI checked the current sensing resistors on <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> \"good\" (<RESISTOR>R7120</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>-<RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR>) & (<RESISTOR>R7150</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR>)\nI know <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> is working as the machine will operate from battery.\nOut of desperation I changed <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>.\n\nThis is the first \"not charging\" <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> unit I have come across.  I am sure I am missing something stupid here but a nudge in the right direction would be most helpful.   \n\nThanks, Randall"

I won't be able to do additional troubleshooting on this board but moving forward when I see this again I need to know where to look.\n\nquestions \"Theoretical at this point.\"\n[LIST]\n[*]<TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> \"if the internal diode was shorted\" the unit would be in charge mode all the time correct? The FET would be in continuous bypass \"on\" mode. So that is most likely not the problem? If it were opened it would still work as a FET and charge but would not run off of battery? Perhaps the FET was damaged \"<TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR>\" or the signal was missing on Pin 4 I guess I should of looked at that but didn't. I could of bypassed <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> and see if it charged.\n[*]The battery was changed out with a new one with the same result. So it's not the battery.\n[*]PPBUS G3H I assumed was good as the machine was running. I guess it could of been low but that would not of been caused by a short. That was ruled out by normal current draw.\n[*]I also gave this board a quick look over with the FLIR and did not see anything glaring back at me.\n[/LIST]\nThere was no evidence of water damage on this unit. Came in for battery charging problems.\n\nI will find out the results from the secondary board level repair shop in a few days and will post their results here. Just seems like I have to be over looking something real stupid as there is not much to this circuit.\n\nHas anyone seen this before or a failure in <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> like this?"
