Just dump balls on there and heat the whole thing up. The balls will only stick to the places on the chip where there are pads.\n\nI would first try to reflow the chip, make sure you 100% clean the glue from under the chip."}

I ordered those.\n\nI tried to reflow it. Obsessively removed all glue under microscope. First attempt changed it slightly for the better, but still green. Second attempt left me with a black screen. I increased the temperature and airflow a fair amount the second time so I might have fried the chip."}
