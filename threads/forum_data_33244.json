Thought, GREAT IM THERE! went a little to fast, and CRACK... Shit... that was my shop tester tho, so no harm done. just a lesson learned.\nRight technique, just got impatient.\n\nThink ill do the other 2009 next because i think it has a KB impression on it, then finally the 2012 to transfer to the right clam shell with the LVDS.\n\nYou guys rock! Thanks for saving me what probably would have been too much time looking for a good reputable source on the interwebs for this info :)"}
