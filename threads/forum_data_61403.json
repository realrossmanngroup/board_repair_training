(The thin piece of Acrylic that goes under the LCD screen and all the diffuser sheets. This is the one that spreads the LED light from the bottom up.\n-Back light diffuser layers.  I think there's 4... Or 5 if counting the aforementioned piece..\n\nMust have:\n-The rubber gasket that goes around the LCD..\n-The small Black glass strip that says \"Macbook Pro\" at the bottom of the screen, which covers all the electronics. (both of the ones I have are cracked)\n\nIf anyone knows the correct names for these parts please post it.\nAnd if anyone has a part number or model number from any company, (it doesn't have to be apple OEM parts) please let me know..\nFinally, if you know where to find any of these, please post a link..\nI'd prefer Amazon or Ebay if needed, but anything will do at this point.. :)\n(I don't care if its ebay, aliexpress, banggood, bob's apple basemaent parts,and so on..)\n\nThanks everyone, and happy repairs.."
