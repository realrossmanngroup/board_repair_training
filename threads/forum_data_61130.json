I was just listing what the schematic said. Trying to be thorough with the info I provided.\nThanks for the measurement tip too, like I said, a little new to this, so I wasn't 100% sure if the rails were related. I thought they might be, but wanted to be thorough. \n\nThe charger is an 85W actually. (which is what my friend told me was the original when he asked me to look at his computer lol)"}
