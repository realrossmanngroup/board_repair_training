The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

Trying to be thorough with the info I provided.\nThanks for the measurement tip too, like I said, a little new to this, so I wasn't 100% sure if the rails were related. I thought they might be, but wanted to be thorough. \n\nThe charger is an 85W actually. (which is what my friend told me was the original when he asked me to look at his computer lol)"
