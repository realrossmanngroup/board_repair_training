I know it shares data line with other components to PCH...\n\nThanks"}

I found something like 0.6v wich I think should be more around 0,4V... I will check also PM_SLP_SUS_L.\n\nI found diode mode on PP3V3_S0 very low 0.050. with PP3V3_T29 full short to ground 0.001 in diode mode, must be something with U3810.\n\nI remove u3810 and will report...
