If U7201 is fucked and shorting to ground, it will pull that enable signal to ground as well. We are pulling off R7252 as a way to isolate where the issue is. \n\nWe have one of two issues.\n\n1) P3V3S5_EN is being CREATED, but shorted to ground by defective U7201(replace U7201 as solution)\n2) P3V3S5_EN is not being created at all(investigate why P3V3S5_EN is missing as solution)\n\nMeasure P3V3S5_EN without R7252 here.\n\nYou should follow the advice, but also ask in your head, [I]why is duke asking me to do this? [\/I]If you do this you will catch up with our reasoning and troubleshooting methods far faster than if you just follow what we say! Nothing will \"happen\" when R7252 is removed because R7252 being removed removes the path between the 3.3v rail enable signal and the chip responsible for 3.3v creation. This advice is not intended as a fix, but rather, as a troubleshooting tactic."}
