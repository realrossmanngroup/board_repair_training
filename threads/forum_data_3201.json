If <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> is fucked and shorting to ground, it will pull that enable signal to ground as well. We are pulling off <RESISTOR>R7252</RESISTOR> as a way to isolate where the issue is. \n\nWe have one of two issues.\n\n1) <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> is being CREATED, but shorted to ground by defective <CHIP>U7201</CHIP>(replace <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> as solution)\n2) <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> is not being created at all(investigate why <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> is missing as solution)\n\nMeasure <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> without <RESISTOR>R7252</RESISTOR> here.\n\nYou should follow the advice, but also ask in your head, [I]why is duke asking me to do this? [/I]If you do this you will catch up with our reasoning and troubleshooting methods far faster than if you just follow what we say! Nothing will \"happen\" when <RESISTOR>R7252</RESISTOR> is removed because <RESISTOR>R7252</RESISTOR> being removed removes the path between the 3.3v rail enable signal and the chip responsible for 3.3v creation.
