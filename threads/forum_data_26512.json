Might be something that goes below its supposed range.\n\nI also have seen this issue before on a damaged ISL, it might look good and the system even tries to boot. But fails randomly or at higher load. You most likely see G3H drop for a split second if this happens but no idea if most multimeters can catch this. This is very rare though, just guessing.\nDoes a diagnostic test give out any details or does it fully pass?\n\nTry to boot the system in verbose mode, maybe you can catch a certain driver initializing before it fails\n\nAlso try to inspect the S4 loop a little more (Does it fully loop into S0 or just S5-->S4-->S5?)\n\nOtherwise no idea"}
