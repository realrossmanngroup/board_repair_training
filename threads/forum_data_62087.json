        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance â€“ this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",

        "PP3V3_S5_LCD": "What is PP3V3_S5_LCD? PP3V3_S5_LCD is a power rail that eventually powers circuitry in the LCD after going through something else. This is required for the LCD to turn on and have a nimage. .",

DDC is a protocol for identifying a screen so that you know what resolution/refresh rate it wants. This is necessary for screen detection, inductor on this data line must be good and DDC voltage must be going to the LCD screen for it to work. ."
