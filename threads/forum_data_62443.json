Cleaned in the ultrasonic twice.\nNo components are visually damaged, badly corroded or burnt. There were smoke traces of 20V short on the USB pcb connector.\nBefore cleaning there was no PD negotiation (5V, 0.4A). After cleaning, 20V is back.\n\nPower on USB-C input is power cycling between 0.038 and 0.089A (20V). \nUsing original 90W charger, also tested 65W original.\n\nPPBUS_G3H 12.36V (slight dip to 12.26V every 3s)\nPPDCIN_G3H 20.30V\nPP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS 20.30V (depending on which is connected)\nPP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS 20.30V ^\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC 3.3V\nPP3V3_G3H 3.3V (slight dip to 2.26V every 3s)\nPP5V_G3S 0.02V jumps to 5V every 3 seconds or so, 21kOhm to gnd\nConfirmed with scope it is exactly 3.5s, attempt to power PP5V_G3S on.\n\nU7650 looks fine, but:\nR7672 measures 0.945k (datasheet says 4.4k)\nR7673 measures 0.945k (datasheet says 1.2k)\nP5VG3S_CSP1 (pin 7) pulsing 5V, pin 8 same.\n\nI have looked around various rails for shorts, but have yet to find anything suspicious."}
