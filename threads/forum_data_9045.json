Board powers on, has backlight, but black LCD. No chime. No liquid. Board has PPVCORE_S0_CPU (1.13v) but is missing PPVCORE_S0_AXG (0v). \n\nAt U7542, I have 0v on pins 4, 7 and 8. Other pins have voltage.\n\nIs this a bad PCH?"}

If backlight is on system must be working. No chime is probably solved by PRAM reset. Got a LCD assembly to test? 2012 has unique connector.\nMeasure all LVDS line at LCD connector on diode mode, should all measure the same."}

You were right, the board actually does have video, just no backlight. It also doesn't chime UNLESS I do a PRAM reset. Also, the board does not boot from a hard drive (known-good cable and drive). I only get 30V at pin 40 on the LVDS connector (shouldn't it be closer to 50V?). Backlight enable is present (3.12v). Changed the LED driver with same results. I get 3.3v on pins 2, 3, 4.

Board wouldn't chime when powered on unless I reset PRAM, and wouldn't boot from hard drive. Made me think to try booting from USB (even though I had no backlight), and I was able to see the padlock icon pop up. Ah ha! I didn't think that would be the issue, since it would PRAM reset this whole time (normally with BIOS lock it won't PRAM reset). Well, I guess the PRAM reset was only partial (if that's possible?), because once I got rid of the BIOS lock, and reset the PRAM, backlight returned once it hit OSX (it didn't work even immediately after the PRAM reset).\n\nThanks, duke--mark this one solved."}
