        "PPVCORE_S0_AXG": "What is PPVCORE_S0_AXG? This is vcore going to the CPUâ€™s integrated graphics processor for CPUs that have an integrated GPU. When this is missing on a device that has an integrated GPU and no discrete GPU, it usually means either no screen is detected, or the GPU integrated into the CPU is dead..",

        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "LCD_BKLT_PWM": "What is LCD_BKLT_PWM? LCD_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly.."

            "message": "Got this one fixed, and it was sort of weird.\n\nBoard ended up being EFI locked, even though the board WOULD PRAM reset (never seen that before). Board wouldn't chime when powered on unless I reset PRAM, and wouldn't boot from hard drive. Made me think to try booting from USB (even though I had no backlight), and I was able to see the padlock icon pop up. Ah ha! I didn't think that would be the issue, since it would PRAM reset this whole time (normally with BIOS lock it won't PRAM reset). Well, I guess the PRAM reset was only partial (if that's possible?), because once I got rid of the BIOS lock, and reset the PRAM, backlight returned once it hit OSX (it didn't work even immediately after the PRAM reset).\n\nThanks, duke--mark this one solved."
