    "definitions": {
        "820-3209": "What is 820-3209? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U7201": "What is U7201? U7201 is responsible for the 3.3v and 5v power rails on many devices..",
        "U2700": "What is U2700? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS? This power rail is PPBUS_G3H after going through a current sense resistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H & the input of PPBUS_G3H to circuitry that provides power for the CPU..",
        "PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS? This is PPBUS_G3H after passing through a current sense resistor that splits it off from the rest of PPBUS_G3H. The purpose of this is so that we can measure how much current is flowing to this part of the machine..",
        "PPVIN_SW_T29BST": "What is PPVIN_SW_T29BST? a SIGNAL.",

        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. ."

I have this macbook air there is no have green light.. i found some corruption on the resistors <RESISTOR>R7721</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7720</RESISTOR> and the cap <CAPACITOR>C7723</CAPACITOR>.. i replaced this 3 but i haven't green light. No water damage in any other side.. looking for power rails i see <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> Is missing, and i replace the <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> Looking for a solution but i have nothing. so, how i can know when the <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> is Missing? how to measure this?  i do check the resistance at the <RESISTOR>R7251</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7252</RESISTOR> and i have 00.2 ohms.. but i dont know how to measure the enable signals.\n\nMy measures\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> : @ <RESISTOR>R5301</RESISTOR> 8.16v\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_SW_T29BST</SIGNAL>  :  @ <CAPACITOR>C3890</CAPACITOR> 0v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> : @ <CAPACITOR>C7556</CAPACITOR> 8,16v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL> : @ Pin 23 <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> 8,16v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> : @ Pin 12 <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> 3,40v\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> : @ Pin 1 <CHIP>U2700</CHIP> 3,40v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> : @ 0,00v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V_S5</SIGNAL> : @ 0,01v\n\nPlz, whats should i do?"
