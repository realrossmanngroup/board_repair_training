Press any Key or wait a few seconds to continue.\"\n\nAfter a view seconds it boots without error into the login mask.\nWhen i restart from the login mask it boots also again without error message.\nWhen i unplug the charger, the next boot is with error message.\nIs this normal - booting this board naked? Or do i have an issue?"
