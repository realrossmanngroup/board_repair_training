After getting image to show on screen i get no backlight.\n\nMeasured around the board and noticed u9701 is not getting any voltage on bkl_pwm nothing gets to c9704 or r9704. As far as i can see gpu provides voltage for this?\n\nif the gpu is not sending out the voltage is this only fixable by replacing gpu?"

One of those may be bad?\n\nso i tested a different screen and i get 3.3 on pin 4 with that one. cable on other screen may be bad but it still wouldnt help that i get no voltage on pin 2 and 3 of j9000. What could be preventing u9000 from turning on? Theres no voltage on pin 1 of u9000 or r9014 ?"

It does this via the DDC circuit.\n\nThe DDC circuit has R9008 and R9009 as pullup resistors on the line so that the LCD can talk to the MCP. Are these good? 3.3v on both side with no LCD connected?"
