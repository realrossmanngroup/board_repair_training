        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook won’t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad. Each CD3215 in the system needs to be functioning in order for any of them to speak to the charger and negotiate receiving 20v from the charger rather than the default 5v that a USB-C charger puts out before communicating with the system. .",
