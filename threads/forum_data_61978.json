        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SSD_RESET_L": "What is SSD_RESET_L? SSD_RESET_L is a signal that puts the SSD in reset mode when it is low. This means the SSD will not be accessible when this signal is asserted.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v..",
        "SSD_PWR_EN": "What is SSD_PWR_EN? SSD_PWR_EN is a signal that tells the chip making the power rail for the SSD to turn on when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
