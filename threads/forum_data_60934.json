This signal will open load switch <CHIP>U8030</CHIP> and allow 3.3 S5 to become 3.3V S0. Please have a look at page 59/76 of the schematics and inspect those resistors.\n\nThe laptop should boot even without those caps removed, you can add them later and run jumper wires instead of missing pad/trace). Right now, you need to find out what is happening with necessary voltages.
