I tried PRAM Reset as suggested when I came in this morning (Please not that <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> is removed at this time) and I still did not get a response from the Muix to send <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL>. However I decided to put a second new <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> on and I booted and everything works , <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL> is now present and I have a machine with backlight. Maybe the second reboot after replacing U901 got the Mux to send the signal? Or will it not send it without <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> present. In that case it was a faulty Mux. Thanks your help guys!"
