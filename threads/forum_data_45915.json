        "message":"Ok , so I got it working.. . Just not sure what did it. I tried PRAM Reset as suggested when I came in this morning (Please not that U9701 is removed at this time) and I still did not get a response from the Muix to send LCD_BKLT_PWM. However I decided to put a second new U9701 on and I booted and everything works , LCD_BKLT_PWM is now present and I have a machine with backlight. Maybe the second reboot after replacing U901 got the Mux to send the signal? Or will it not send it without U9701 present. In that case it was a faulty Mux. Thanks your help guys!"
