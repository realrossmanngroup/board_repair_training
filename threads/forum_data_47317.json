It loads most of the way and then shows the prohibited icon. I have tried many drives, OSX versions and USB C adapters.\n\nIt can boot to its internal SSD, and an USB OSX installer, and complete an installation without issue.\nI am worried that it not booting to a USB OSX is a symptom of a bigger issue with the board, it seems confusing that we are getting the prohibited icon on this unit, as i have worked on many <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>'s that boot to a USB OSX without problem.\n\nI have replaced J3300\n<CHIP>U2800</CHIP>\nBoth <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s\nReprogrammed EFI with clean ME Region.\nEverything else on the unit works, and it works perfectly from the internal SSD"
