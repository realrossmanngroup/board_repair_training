When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",

(I've scratched gently)\n\nAs for the ID0R, I've checked <RESISTOR>R5441</RESISTOR>, measures 45kOhms. It has continuity to ISL pin 9. No corrosion around SMC or ISL. <CAPACITOR>C5441</CAPACITOR> looks good too.\n\nI feel like solving touchpad sensor could solve DC-in sensor. \n\nAny ideas?"

            "message": "Fans gradually ramping to full speed is usually related to TS0P, since TS0P sensor is located in the trackpad, either bad trackpad, bad trackpad cable or bad traces/pins on J4800. When SMC can't read trackpad sensor temperature it ramps up the fan.\n\nIn your case I am sure it's your connector.\njust by looking I see pin 19 look very bad 17 also, these 2 pins communicate TS0P with SMC. \nI would first touch up the pins and see if it looks great again. Otherwise remove, clean and replace.\n\nBy the way, I like this kind of connector it s easier to inspect and to test the soldered pins with internal pins. Not like for example macbook air one where you need to slide in the cable. Usually even when it looks imaculate, you still can't catch a small piece of metal inside shorting out the pins.\nWhen it s liquid damage and the cable stay crusty inside the connector, sometimes a small piece from the trackpad stay stuck inside."
