        "message":"Ok I found the issue :( someone removed the gpu heatsink and reflowed the gpu and found solder balls fused together:(\nso it?s a parts board.\n\nOne question though I have 2 boards that I repaired that will power on with magesafe in one direction but if I reverse  the connector to the other side it won?t power on. Not even a green light. I tried several dc in boards but have the same issue. I?m lost with these 2 they are both 820-2915b"
