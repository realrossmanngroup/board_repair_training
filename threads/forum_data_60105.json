S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

            "message": "Let's say I have a board with some problem on a certain state Six (  G3h, S5, S3, or S0).\n\nSome of the power lines are ok, some have a voltage close to the value expected, but still out or range ( for example 30%-40% below the expected value) , some have a voltage in the mV range, some are 0V.\n\nHow would I choose the power rail to investigate first? Is there a criteria to follow in order to speed up troubleshooting?\n\nAlso, does the order in which the different power rails appear in the schematics have any relavence to troubleshoot ing order?\n\nAs an example, I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2530</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A with problems on S3.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL>=5V\n<SIGNAL>PPVTT_S3_DDR_BUFF</SIGNAL>=0.84V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3_REG</SIGNAL>=2.8V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V_S3_FET</SIGNAL>=15mV\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_ENET_FET</SIGNAL>=0V\nPP1V2R1V05_ENET=0V\n\nOut of my gut, I would go with <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3_REG</SIGNAL>, as I interpret the presence of a non zero voltage as and indication of something going which somehow get shut down.\n\nIs my assumption correct?"
