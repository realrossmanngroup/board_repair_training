Came in with no liquid damage, customer reported they were watching a movie and it shut off unexpectedly. I get intermittent green light but it only pulls 0.013A from the bench PSU. Found that PP5V_S3 was shorted to ground (0.30ohm) and injected 1v, found C6213 to heat up so I removed it. Short is clear now but still not getting PP5V_S3.\n\nPPBUS_G3H: 12.6v\nPP3V3_SUS: 0v\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN: 0v\nPM_DSW_PWRGD: 0v\nPCH_DSWVRMEN: 3.3v\nPM_BATLOW_L: 0v\nPCH_SRTCRST_L: 3.4v\nPPVRTC_G3H: 3.4v\nRTC_RESET_L: 3.4v"}
