        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "U1930": "What is U1930? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "CPU_VCCST_PWRGD": "What is CPU_VCCST_PWRGD? a SIGNAL."

Fan spins at high rate and stays that way forever.\n\nPower supply draw: 0.315ma\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 8.57v \n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.43v\n\nCPU gets mildly hot.\n\nNo signs of corrosion, board is super clean. When mounted on the case, the power supply draw goes to 0.450ma and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> drops to 6.5v.\n\nThnaks guys!"

After the post, i dig in and found <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> was missing on PIN 6 of <CHIP>U1930</CHIP>.\nSo i replaced <CHIP>U1930</CHIP>, both the capacitor and resistor around him, and still no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, had to make a jumper wire from another point where <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> was present and boom, problem solved!\n\n<CHIP>U1930</CHIP> needs <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> to output <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL>.\n\nThanks for your time my man! I'll be here often, out of nowhere i'm getting costumers with macbooks, i was just an iphone guy.\nI'll attach the picture with the jumper i've made."
