The computer immediately shut down, and now when I boot it there is no display on the internal LCD as well as over HDMI with and without the LCD unplugged. It does seem to boot because it chimes and the volume keys work, and it responds to the ALS. I tried PRAM and SMC reset, nothing.\n\nIs there any hope or is the GPU dead?"
