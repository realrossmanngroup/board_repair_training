        "message":"This 820-3115 came to me dead. I fixed a short on 3V42 and now it has quater fan spin. PP3V3_S5 is stable, PP5V_S3 is pulsing every 5 seconds cause PM_SPL_S4_l is also pulsing. Not really sure where to go from here. Any known suspects like U1950 on 00165? I did replace U7200 and clock ic so far but no change. Thanks in advance."
