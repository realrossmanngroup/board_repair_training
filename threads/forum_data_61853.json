        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",

This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad..",

        "PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA": "What is PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA? This is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad. Each CD3215 in the system needs to be functioning in order for any of them to speak to the charger and negotiate receiving 20v from the charger rather than the default 5v that a USB-C charger puts out before communicating with the system. .",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. ."
