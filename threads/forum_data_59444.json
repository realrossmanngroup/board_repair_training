        "R6905": "What is R6905? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on older Macbooks, pre-2011 models. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger.",

PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H is the input voltage to the PP3V42_G3H buck converter circuit, it can be either charger voltage or battery voltage depending on what the system power source is. This often shorts to ground when one of the input capacitors dies. .",
