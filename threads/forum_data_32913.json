        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",

            "message": "I got this board in because it was SOMETIMES turning on, and sometimes not. The device was reaching S0 state, but still not turning on sometimes.\n\nI found almost no liquid damage, apart from two tiny spots. One spot had discoloured a capacitor (<CAPACITOR>C3282</CAPACITOR>), which i replaced even though it wasn't shorted or out of cap. The other spot had ruined a resistor (<RESISTOR>R8178</RESISTOR>), and destroyed the trace beneath. This resistor was a 100ohm, and it carried <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL>, which was getting stuck at one end of the dead resistor. I replaced this resistor and repaired the trace and the problem was totally solved. Computer has been perfect for the past two days.\n\nToday, i came to it and it was totally dead again, won't turn on ever now. It seems to be a new problem because more rails are missing. <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> doesn't even exist anymore for example.\n\nI've given the board two thorough cleans through the crest, and i cannot find any other areas of corrosion. Please help!\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 8.57v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.42v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 5.12v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> =5.12v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> = 3.32v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> =3.32v\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> = 3.32v\n\n[B]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> = 0.05v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> = 0.00v\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> =0.00v[/B]\n\nAny support would be greatly appreciated."

The probe point next to it, connecting to <RESISTOR>R1667</RESISTOR> is almost completely gone from corrosion, but the little bit left is still making a solid connection to <RESISTOR>R4852</RESISTOR> for <SIGNAL>TPAD_SPI_MOSI</SIGNAL> and to <RESISTOR>R1667</RESISTOR>."

Fan spinning now and problem solved! Thank you so much for your time."
