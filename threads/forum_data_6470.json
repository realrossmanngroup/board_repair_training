This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger.

Now i get the following components very hot when i put 3 volts on them :\n\n<CAPACITOR>C2901</CAPACITOR>\n<CAPACITOR>C3101</CAPACITOR>\n\n<CAPACITOR>C2300</CAPACITOR>\n\nas well as the RAM blocks.\n\nAny suggestions? PP3V42 ist present and stable, i have green light as well. F7040 is shorted on PIN2, that where i put 3V on the board."
