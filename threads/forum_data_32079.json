This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

Compare the measurements. I have had these issues like this from a SMC acting funny and if the SMC was bad that could explain why 3v42 is being pulled down but DON\"T touch the SMC yet."
