When you plug in the charger with the battery plugged in it will never give a green light. with the battery unplugged it will randomly get a green light after a few times of unplugging and re-plugging. with the battery in dc in is at 2.2 volts on the fuse. with the battery out dc in ranges from 3v to .3v then will just spike to 16.5 after the green light comes on. if the battery is connected after the green light is on the charger the battery will charge just fine till full and will stay charging unless unplugged. then after re-plugging it in it will again fail to get a green light. I have no clue where to start with this because of the seemingly complete randomness."}

The missing temp is probably iStat being stupid as that would give an ASD error for sure.  6 amps is possible on the lower voltage rails so it could also be a mistake in iStat. I'm at a loss with this one. Was the SMC replaced with the correct one? Got access to an AASP that can do an MRI for you?"}

Im pretty sure the smc was correct but they were bought from aliexpress. I also noticed that closing the lid wont put it to sleep either. This could very well be a bad smc. I can try another after work"}
