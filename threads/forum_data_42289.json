Logic board is immaculate.... to immaculate TBH.\nTested so far:-\nPins 18/19 J8300 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_UF</SIGNAL> =0.00v\nL8304 Pins 1/2 =0.00v\n<RESISTOR>R5670</RESISTOR> not fitted\n<CHIP>U8300</CHIP> pin 1 <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL>= 0.00v\n           pin 2/3 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> =3.334v\n           pin 4/5 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_R</SIGNAL> =0.001v\n           pin 6 GND =OK\nJ8300 pin 14 <SIGNAL>DP_INT_HPD_CONN</SIGNAL> =0.00v\n           pin 24 <SIGNAL>DP_INT_ML_P</SIGNAL><0> =0.001v\n           pin 24 <SIGNAL>DP_INT_ML_N</SIGNAL><0> =0.00v\n\nSeeing as the screen is illuminating I have not tested pins 3/4 on J8300\n\nNow, I am assuming that <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL> needs to be present to activate <CHIP>U8300</CHIP> but reading the shematic ( probably incorrectly) this leads back to pin 765 on the CPU. using Landrex I do not see anywhere that I can test for <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL>. Also.... might be me and it being an early morning, I have done a search on the forum for <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3435</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> no image even down to a straight <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3435</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> search and apart for a post that has Duke on it where it is surmized that the CPU is dead, I have found nothing with reference to this issue on this board.\n\nHas anyone got any pointers or is it in fact a \"gonna\"?\n\nMany thanks in advance."

            "message": "Hi [USER=\"682\"]2informaticos[/USER] . OK above testing was done without the screen attached. I did do a PRAM and SMC reset prior to doing the probing, but did the PRAM one again. I also reconnected the screen.\nUpdated info:-\nStill no chine.\nConnected a HDD that I have got multiple OSx on and the LED flashes. I also plugged in a keyboard and used to do the PRAM and SMC reset. As to the PRAM the logic board restarted and the SMC the LED on the adapter changed from orange to green and back to orange so I can clarify the USB side of things are working.\nPins 18/19 of J8300 with screen connected goes to 3.331v and stays at that voltage.\nPin 14 goes to 2.63v and stays.\n\nI have an MBA here that is a <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1370</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. Is the screen usable with that of the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1465</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>? Just for diagnosis puroses.\nThanks."
