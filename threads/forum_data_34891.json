With battery attached it stays green. \nSMC Reset changes light like it supposed to. \n\nEnergy consumption: 0.04 amps\nS5 rail present, SMC_BC_ACOK high\nS5_PWRGD High\nPP3V3_SUS present \ns4 rail is as dead as Steve Jobs. \n\ni do not really understand how S4_PWR_EN is generated\nin schematics it goes from U8170 NOSTUFF AND chip, AB is PM_SLP_S5_L(0V) SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN(0v), both are low.\nI have already desoldered bios chip and tested if i can read it. re-programmed it with \"clear me\" bios, nothing really changed. \nNow i'm trying to test clock signals to BIOS chip with a cheap Oscilloscope, but i do not really know if 20mhz is good enough for this purpose. \n\n\n\nPlease don\u00b4t tell me SMC is dead - i have a greenlight and SMC Reset indication. :)"}

This also means that if the battery died (overdischarged, for example), we will have this strange behavior. I guess Lous has rage-broken such board in some of his videos, thinking it is the CPU. \ncan someone confirm if 00165 starts without the battery?"}
