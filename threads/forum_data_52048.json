Looking for guidance.  \n\nMy 3.3v rails are up\nMag light one wire good.\n\nP3V3S6 <SIGNAL>EN_R</SIGNAL> only for a 1/4 second *<CHIP>U7501</CHIP>\"  and of course the <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>  signal is on only for a 1/4 second.\nThe bounce lasts about 1/4 a second and never repeats.   One bounce.   Current draw on board is normal for it's state.  \nThermal imaging did not show any red flags.  I didn't expect it to.  I did watch it during the bounce cycle and did not see anything out of the normal.  I did see a few chips turn on as they should. \n\nI am just looking for some guidance for chasing bouncers like this.   I have already done a detailed physical inspection and checked for shorts on all the rails.  Check the CPU rails.  has to be a signal shutdown of some kind but not sure where to turn."
