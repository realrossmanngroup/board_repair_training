        "message":"I received water damaged Macbook Pro 15\" Mid 2015 from clients words has been water damaged for a month. During testing I figured out that mac was working off the battery only. The original screen was working fine. After a week, we fixed the board start to test and realized that LCD has no backlight! Mac works fine with new lcd, but old one has last its backlight. I remove plastic cover on the lcd and tried new flex, there is no water damage on control board.\n\nKind of stuck here, because customer knows screen was working.\n\nIs there anything I can do to repair back-light on lcd panel? what could have happened?"
