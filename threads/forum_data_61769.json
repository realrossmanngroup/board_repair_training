        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8400": "What is U8400? a CHIP.",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "I2C_BKLT_SCL": "What is I2C_BKLT_SCL? a SIGNAL.",
        "I2C_BKLT_SDA": "What is I2C_BKLT_SDA? I2C_BKLT_SDA is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",

        "PPVIN_SW_LCDBKLT_SW": "What is PPVIN_SW_LCDBKLT_SW? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_FB": "What is LCDBKLT_FB? LCDBKLT_FB is a feedback line between backlight output and the feedback pin on the LED driver. When this connection is broken, backlight output will be equal to PPBUS_G3H voltage of the system rather than boosting. Since this point is the highest voltage in the system, it is the fastest to corrode when liquid damaged, so it is a very common point to check when there is no backlight. .",

The board was in terrible condition. I think it was a refurbished board from apple. the customer promised me that he bought an refurbished macbook and there was no repair. There was flux an solderballs an bad solder joints all over the board. So i made a video to safe the hints and did first an ultrasonic-cleaning.
