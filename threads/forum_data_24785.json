Shorting smc_bc_ok to pp3v42 might damage the SMC and will also possibly start the SMC before the power is actually stable which can cause weird issues.\n\nIs the charger a known good charger? Might be pulling too much because it tries to charge the battery and boot the system, but unlikely the issue. Also check out the U7100 area, if all passive components measure alright you can try to replace it. Otherwise might be SMC related, not sure."
