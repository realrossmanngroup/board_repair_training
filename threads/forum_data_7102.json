I used the same thermo profile like over years without problems.\n\nso do you can explain why the voltages are going to zero by injecting 1.05V ?\n\ncan here be a problem with cracks under u1800? PPCPUVTT_S0 is connected with PP1V05_S0_PCH and PPVTT_S0_PCH ?\n\nwhen injecting the 1.05V into Pin2 L7630 only the S0 and S3 Rails going down to zero,\n\nS5 rails,\nPP3V42_G3H,\nPPBUS_CPU_IMVP_ISNS and\nPPBUS_G3H\n\nnot going down to zero."}
