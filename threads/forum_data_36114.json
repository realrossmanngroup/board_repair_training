        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook won’t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",

        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
        "HALL_SENSOR_LEFT": "What is HALL_SENSOR_LEFT? HALL_SENSOR_LEFT is a signal from the hall sensor on the left side of the machine that indicates that the lid has been closed. This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen.",
