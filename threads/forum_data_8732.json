            "message": "Hello,\nsorry for my bad english. I have a Problem with a 320-3115-B. It has a green light on the charger but wont turn on. I measured the powerrails and noticed, that <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3,62V. I thought that my multimeter could be a little of but <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is exakt 12,60V. This board had waterdamage but looks very clean overall. I also noticed, that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is there but most other S0 rails like <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0</SIGNAL> or <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> are missing. These are all shorted to groung and i can not find where the short is. Another thing that i noticed is that <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> is getting a little warm. Means this, that <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> is shorting the S0 rails to ground or is it only still reciving power anr trying to work? The last and strangest thing i noticed is, that it makes a silent beeping sound in the <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> areea if its getting power. It sonds like a damaged HDD with a litle click every second. I tryed to attach the sound file to this post (.m4a/.mp3) but it says invalid file. I´m not sure if this file is needed but if i can provide it.\nIs there any hope to save this board or is it already dead?\nThank you for your help.\nBest regards,\nFelix"

I´m sure on both of my two boards is at least one component of almost every circuit missing but i see if i can rebuild it on one of them for a measurement. If i can get a comparisson i´ll let you know. I think that it is to low too because pin 1 of L7760 measures ~0,41V which is in the dimension of many working circuits in my experience... Come back to this if you have time and a board for it :). Thank you!"
