Does not have S0 Enables. So i measure diode mode on pin4 on U8180 and it is low (around  0.065V). I injected voltage on PM_SLP_S3_BUF_L. But nothing gets hot and current draw is low (around 0.1A) \n\nComputer is working if i force S0 state by bridging pin4+5 on U8180 but then of course doesn't sleep very well...\n\nAny tips to find out what is causing the low voltage drop on PM_SLP_S3_BUF_L and P5VS0_EN?\n\nThanks"}

First remove R8185\/87 and see if that solves the low resistance. If not the U3210 would be my first suspect and after that just start pulling the others."}
