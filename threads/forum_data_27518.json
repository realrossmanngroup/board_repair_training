            "message": "I got this MacBook Air <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>\n\nCame in dead. Does not have S0 Enables. So i measure diode mode on pin4 on <CHIP>U8180</CHIP> and it is low (around  0.065V). I injected voltage on <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_BUF_L</SIGNAL>. But nothing gets hot and current draw is low (around 0.1A) \n\nComputer is working if i force S0 state by bridging pin4+5 on <CHIP>U8180</CHIP> but then of course doesn't sleep very well...\n\nAny tips to find out what is causing the low voltage drop on <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_BUF_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>P5VS0_EN</SIGNAL>?\n\nThanks"
