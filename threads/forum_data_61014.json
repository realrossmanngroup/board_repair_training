After swapping both chips again, I finally got 20V from the charger  But no S5 Rails I traced this problem back to the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> chip which did not output a <SIGNAL>PMIC_PGD</SIGNAL> signal after swapping <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> the voltages match and I get <SIGNAL>PP3V_S0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> but no boot, the fan turns when I connect it after some back and forth I noticed that <SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0G_PH1</SIGNAL> / 2/3 was missing What I was able to trace back to a missing <SIGNAL>GTVR_FCCM</SIGNAL> from <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>.\n\n<CHIP>U7100</CHIP> gets 0V on pin2 (<SIGNAL>CPUVR_VCC</SIGNAL>) I was able to fix this after I replaced <RESISTOR>R7192</RESISTOR> and then the board drew about 500mA and <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> got very hot I think I had a short circuit on Pin2 but I'm not quite sure after swapping the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> but this was fixed <SIGNAL>GTVR_FCCM</SIGNAL> is now 1.6V\nNow I notice that <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> are getting very hot and <TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> are mine even after I have noticed Resistance to ground of <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS</SIGNAL> only at 40Ohm (Black probe on ground) I exchanged <DIODE>D3400</DIODE> now the resistance is 1. 1K Ohm, however, <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> are still very hot but get 20V and round about 300mA from the charger now I'm standing on the hose and could use some help Thanks in advance I'm looking forward to learning something new"
