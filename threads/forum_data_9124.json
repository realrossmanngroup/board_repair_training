Replaced connector, lost back-light, going to trouble shoot it again tomorrow.\nAND the connector has same # of pins but different anchors, worked before. Is it a problem?\n\n<CHIP>U9000</CHIP> was nicked, I replaced it. Then tested and found 3.33V on PINS 2,3;  0V on PIN 1 = <SIGNAL>LCD_IG_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> = <SIGNAL>LVDS_IG_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL> = <SIGNAL>L_VDD_EN</SIGNAL> (out) from <CHIP>U1800</CHIP>; 0V on remaining PINS of <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>.\n\nFirst (dumb question): display must be connected to get this voltage, like for backlight?  I tried two displays, but not sure I have a known good anymore and getting new one tomorrow. Asking to buy time till I get the new display.\n\nTwo, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is 360 OHM to ground, and donor board is giving me more than 2K. Is this a problem or part of my problem?\n\nThree, <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> needs an input somewhere to output <SIGNAL>L_VDD_EN</SIGNAL>?\n\nFour: any usual suspects when we have no display on this model?\n\nALSO, I tried searching for previous posts, but got 0 results. Is the search engine down?\n\nTIA!"

Otherwise I can harvest a 2012 connector. New ones need 1 more week.\n\nWill measure everything else tomorrow with known good display and report back."
