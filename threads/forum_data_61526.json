There was a bit of liquid around Audio ICs U6500\/20\/60.\n\nCleaned TB connectors. There was a few pins a bit burned. Re-soldered pins and TB start to works fine.\nWhen turned on there was only audio on one side and other speaker sounded like under water.\nCleaner Audio ICs area + reflow of ICs and sound is working on both channels and it is very clear.\n\nAfter short time TB stop working and after boot there was fans on max for around 1 second and reboot.\nChecked TB connectors and re-soldered pins one more time and it was working and after a few hours I did manual restart and now when press power button after a 20-30s fans on max for 1s and reboot - there is no log in screen. \n\nSame issue with connected or disconnected TB.\n\nAny idea?"}
