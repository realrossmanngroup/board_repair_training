            "message": "Hi,\n\nI got this board with a no backlight issue.\nNo liquid damage. It shows the question mark. Just no backlight.\n\nI tried different monitor with different LVDS cable.\nI changed the LVDS connector on the board.\nI changed the LED Driver. I bought one from L2. I thought it was bad so I ordered few from China.\n\nThis is what I have:\n<CHIP>U9700</CHIP>\nPin 1 VIN - 8.4V\nPin 3 SWA - 8.4V\nPin 4 SWB - 8.4V\nPin 6 EN - 8.4V\nPin 16 PWM - 3.3V I can see the nice square wave on the scope\nPin 22 OVP - 1.4V\nPin 24 VOUT - 8.4V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> - 8.4V at the LVDS connector.\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\n\nThis tells me the CHIP is bad, but that's impossible.  I ordered it from different location. \nI still have 3 to try, but I'm sure I'm missing something.\n\nThanks."
