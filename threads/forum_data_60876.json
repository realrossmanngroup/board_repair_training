            "message": "Hello! This board came here with no power. It had a sticky layer of some undefined substance all over it, like a kind of oil or something. In the beginning the fan was spinning for a few seconds and then die and would do same thing if pressed power button but no fan spin/stop loop if no battery connected and just connected to power. I inspected the whole board under the microscope and could not find anything looking corroded or visually bad, so I decided to ultrasonic clean it because I thought maybe something could be stuck under PCH/CPU making the board not turn on. Now the board is stuck in S0, but no PP1V05 and obviously no VCORE. After some inspection and measurements I found that <RESISTOR>R7614</RESISTOR> was bad, so I replaced it, but same thing. Any ideas?"
