The fluctuation you are experiencing, ranging from 0.80V to 1.1V, suggests that there may be an issue with the power supply or the circuitry related to those pins. It is important for these pins to have a consistent 5V voltage for proper USB functionality. I recommend further troubleshooting or consulting a technician to diagnose and resolve the issue."
