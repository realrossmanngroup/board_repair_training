        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed â€“ if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

            "message": "I got water damaged <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1932</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> ( <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board). Motherboard itself had only few small spots of liquid around L7670 and J6620, the rest literally looks perfect. I found out that the battery is dead and needs to be replaced along with trackpad and trackpad flex, which were corroded. I put new parts, computer is working fine except trackpad haptic - it does not make \"click\" when pressed. In the system, the click function works (it selects things), but trackpad does not vibrate. I have already tried other trackpad, other flex and put motherboard to known good topcase and the result is the same. I have compared diode readings of J6700 with other working board and readings are exactly the same. I have Inspected areas of T2 - no signs of liquid there.. Any ideas?"

I don't know how I have missed it, I was measuring the connector in diode mide... After replacing it, haptic is working now, but you pointed another problem, that I haven't noticed before. When I close the lid, screen turns off, but keyboard backlight stay on and computer doesn't go to sleep (fan is spinning constantly). I'm waiting for customer to send me passwort to make sure it's not system problem."
