        "message":"Hello community,\n\ni read a lot of interesting threads the last days here and i decided to register myself and i hope someone can help me with a Macbook Pro 15\" mid 2014.\n\nFrom one day to the other the macbook wont start. I unplugged the battery, ssd and pressed the power button for 15 seconds. Then I connected everything again and the macbook started, but the internal display stays black. I checked the mainboard and saw that the capacitor C7333 was broken. I replaced it with a new one, but still no picture on the screen, but backlight. I can start the device with an external monitor but only when the lid is closed or when i unplug the internal lcd from the board. I tested also another lcd - same problem. \n\nOn L8300 Pin 2 has 5V when chiming. \nJ8300 Pin 9 has 2,8V.\n\nAny tips.\n\nThank you."
