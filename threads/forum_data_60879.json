    "definitions": {
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. ."

ISL has been swapped. No change in Adapter Sense, SMC LID, FINSTACKSNS_ALERT_L, <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> or the SDA/SCL lines with cable connected or disconnected. I'm guessing theres a sensor reading being sent when the cable is connected that prevents the board from starting?\n\nGuessing I need to change the SMC, I tried reflowing it. But I'm confused as to why the board will start with cable unplugged."
