It turned out to be a thermal paste that they had used on the CPU heatsink.

The joints looked absolutely perfect and look perfect again now. However, after doing this - the behaviour of the laptop temporarily changed. The fans were turning on and remaining on, spinning up faster and faster and then eventually switching off after about 45 seconds, still nothing on screen though. The fans still did this even with the trackpad connected. I was able to start it in SMC bypass mode, but nothing on screen and same switch off after around 45 seconds, however i know that it was in bypass mode because the fans came on full rather than gradually climbing. So I opened up the boardview and schematic, got the multimeter back out and went to turn it on again to begin testing.... now it's back to doing the momentary fan spin! sometimes spins for a second or two, sometimes barely spins at all. This is making me think that there is an intermittent connection somewhere or a faulty chip which is being influenced by heat and movement. What do you think?"}
