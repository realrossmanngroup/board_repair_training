This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",

It turned out to be a thermal paste that they had used on the CPU heatsink.

            "message": "Oh dear... the plot thickens.\n\nAfter the above, I decided to resolder <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> again, this time removing it completely from the board and once again replacing all the solder and soldering it back on. The joints looked absolutely perfect and look perfect again now. However, after doing this - the behaviour of the laptop temporarily changed. The fans were turning on and remaining on, spinning up faster and faster and then eventually switching off after about 45 seconds, still nothing on screen though. The fans still did this even with the trackpad connected. I was able to start it in SMC bypass mode, but nothing on screen and same switch off after around 45 seconds, however i know that it was in bypass mode because the fans came on full rather than gradually climbing. So I opened up the boardview and schematic, got the multimeter back out and went to turn it on again to begin testing.... now it's back to doing the momentary fan spin! sometimes spins for a second or two, sometimes barely spins at all. This is making me think that there is an intermittent connection somewhere or a faulty chip which is being influenced by heat and movement. What do you think?"
