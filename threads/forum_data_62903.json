            "message": "I got this Macbook not turning on with slight oxidation around <CAPACITOR>C3898</CAPACITOR>/99 on the <SIGNAL>PP15V_TBT</SIGNAL> line.\nI cleaned and replaced the caps, and now I am getting 15V on the <SIGNAL>PP15V_TBT</SIGNAL> line.\n\nIt worked fine for a week, then shut down and would not turn on anymore. After reconnecting, the battery now turns on and works. \nNow the Macbook turns on and shows its charging at 100%, but the minute I pull the charger, it switches off. Apple diagnostic doesn't detect any battery faults. The customer did not have battery problems.\nVery hard to test the board with the battery attached to the board only.\n\nNo Shorts on the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> legs or around,\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> doesn't seem to open with 12.5V on Gate and Source. Drain on 2.1V with connected battery\n\nAny suggestion on what I can test without replacing the battery? Or how to test <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> on the opposite side of the board without a battery?\n\n\nProbably not related, but the screen suddenly shows greenish background. At the same time, it was okay when I reconnected the battery."
