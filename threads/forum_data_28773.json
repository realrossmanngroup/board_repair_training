Customer said it would work off charger for a while and then just randomly go dark again. Inspected board and looks like a flux substances was caked near BIOS chip. Is there any solution to this or is this trash?"

Sold to us fully functional sold to customer then returned to the store with issues turning on. I looked through the board and found absolutely zero liquid. Asked original seller since he's our local electronics recycler and he said he didn't know about BIOS but I think he's lying."
