Example, I do not have PPBUS_G3H. Should I just stop there and chase that one down first on this board, or is there another rail I must chase down first then chase down PPBUS_G3H. \n\nOn older boards, if I did not have the above rail, all other rails were irrelevant until I figured that out first. But while I'm reading other questions on this board I'm confused about what powers need to be present 1st - 2nd- 3rd etc. in order to get PPBUS_G3H and etc. Just looking for some kind of flow chart procedure if possible.\n\nI have voltage right now on my usb meter of 5.14v.\nI do not have PP3V3_G3H_RTC at either CD3215 chips but do have PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO 3.3v at both same chips. \n\nAnd on a side note, are there any specific rails NOT to inject voltage on in order to test? \n\nThanks again."}

I went ahead and replaced both CD3215 because there was a little corrosion around both. I now have 20v at usb meter but 0amps.\nF7000 shows 12.63v but it cycles down to 0v and then back to 12.63v. it does this continually. I rechecked F7000 in diode mode and now I get OL reading and not the 1.300 I had before replacing the CD3215's. \n\nI have all my rails except all of the cpu core voltages and PP3V3_G3SSW_SNS and PP3V3_TBT_X_S0 and PP1V2_S0SW.\nI chased these all down to all the enables are not working. They all seem to come from U7800. \n\nThere was a slight amount of corrosion around U7800 also. I heated it up with some flux to get rid of any water\/corrosion under it but still no go.\n\nWhat things do I need to check as far as voltages on u7800 before condemning it bad? Or, am I heading down the wrong direction going after U7800 as the fault area?\n\nThanks"}
