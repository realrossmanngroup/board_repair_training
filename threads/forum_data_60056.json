Should I just stop there and chase that one down first on this board, or is there another rail I must chase down first then chase down <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. \n\nOn older boards, if I did not have the above rail, all other rails were irrelevant until I figured that out first. But while I'm reading other questions on this board I'm confused about what powers need to be present 1st - 2nd- 3rd etc. in order to get <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and etc. Just looking for some kind of flow chart procedure if possible.\n\nI have voltage right now on my usb meter of 5.14v.\nI do not have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> at either <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> chips but do have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO</SIGNAL> 3.3v at both same chips. \n\nAnd on a side note, are there any specific rails NOT to inject voltage on in order to test? \n\nThanks again."
