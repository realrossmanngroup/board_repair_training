Replaced LP8550 already but still no backlight. When it turns on, backlight flashes for a second and I can measure BKL_PWM going up for a sec but drops after that.\n\nBKL_EN = 2.8V\nBKL_ISET = 0V\nPPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB = Jumps to 25V when backlight flashes then drops to 8.5V\nLCDBKLT_BOOST = 8.5V\nReturn Resistors measures OK\n\nThere is no liquid around SMC\nEDP_BKLT_EN = 3.3V\nEDP_PANEL_PWR = 3.3V\nEDP_BKLT_PWM = 0V\n\nNot sure what other measurements I can post.\n\nCheers"}

Yes went through the tread and based on that was measuring these voltages. \nBKL_EN Voltage Divider has 2.7V\nA5 ball seem to be connected properly to the feedback line\nTried with a spare LCD which works with another 00165 still only matrix, no backlight\n\nWhat is XW7720 ? I saw it on the schematic but don't have anything placed on the board between L7701 and D7701. I tough it is the trace itself or a test point.\n\nAny suggestions?"}

Apparently XW7720 is a trace and not a component. I can measure it A5 all the way to the D7701. So trace should be okay.\n\nDid the wire-jump and it turned on with backlight. Did 3 PRAM resets and removed the jump-wire. Still comes with no backlight.\n\nI wonder if it is an issue with SMC. Perhaps permanent jumpwire is the only solution here, considering if customer is happy with no backlight adjustment?"}
