        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "EDP_PANEL_PWR": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR? a SIGNAL.",
        "EDP_BKLT_PWM": "What is EDP_BKLT_PWM? EDP_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB": "What is PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_BOOST": "What is LCDBKLT_BOOST? LCDBKLT_BOOST is connected to the SWITCH(SW) pin of the LED driver and is switched to ground quickly after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit that boosts PPBUS_G3H to backlight voltage for the screen. .",
        "BKL_ISET": "What is BKL_ISET? a SIGNAL.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "R7704": "What is R7704? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7715": "What is R7715? a RESISTOR.",

When it turns on, backlight flashes for a second and I can measure <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> going up for a sec but drops after that.\n\n<SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> = 2.8V\n<SIGNAL>BKL_ISET</SIGNAL> = 0V\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB</SIGNAL> = Jumps to 25V when backlight flashes then drops to 8.5V\n<SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_BOOST</SIGNAL> = 8.5V\nReturn Resistors measures OK\n\nThere is no liquid around SMC\n<SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL> = 0V\n\nNot sure what other measurements I can post.\n\nCheers"

Yes went through the tread and based on that was measuring these voltages. \n<SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> Voltage Divider has 2.7V\nA5 ball seem to be connected properly to the feedback line\nTried with a spare LCD which works with another 00165 still only matrix, no backlight\n\nWhat is XW7720 ? I saw it on the schematic but don't have anything placed on the board between L7701 and <DIODE>D7701</DIODE>. I tough it is the trace itself or a test point.\n\nAny suggestions?"

So trace should be okay.\n\nDid the wire-jump and it turned on with backlight. Did 3 PRAM resets and removed the jump-wire. Still comes with no backlight.\n\nI wonder if it is an issue with SMC. Perhaps permanent jumpwire is the only solution here, considering if customer is happy with no backlight adjustment?"
