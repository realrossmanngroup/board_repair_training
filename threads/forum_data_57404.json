Once turned on, the backlight flickers on and then off. <SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> starts at about 24v and slowly drops to about 17v. With J9500 cable unplugged i get backlight. So replaced both the cable and the io board with the same result. I've checked for corrosion and found none. Also, the charge light isn't coming on with both io boards used."
