            "message": "I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3787</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A, my customer spilled tea on it. At first it would not power on, I cleaned up the mobo, got it to power on, the customer brought it home, used it all night, closed the lid, which I am assuming placed it to sleep or suspend, the next day, the laptop would not power on, and the magsafe light would not come back on. I removed the board, cleaned it up again, and after lots of testing, the magsafe light worked, the computer powered on, everything seemed great, but here is where my problem started. I forgot the keyboard backlight cable underneath the motherboard when installing the motherboard back in, so I unscrewed a few screws (not all), propped up the board with a nylon spudger, this did flex the board a bit, I got the keyboard backlight cable out, but when I went to turn on the mac, to test everything out, I had no video on the display, and via HDMI and Mini-dispalyport, no video at all whatsoever. The computer does chime, you can hear it boot up, I have thermal imaging and it shows the GPU, CPU, and <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> all heating up. I already tried reflowing the <CHIP>U9650</CHIP>, but no luck. I may not be measuring things correctly so I am a bit of a novice when it comes to reading the schematics. I tried searching for any missing or broken components visually, but everything looks good visually. What should I do next? Thank you in advance. I am thinking this may have something to do with one of the S0-S5 components, but this is just an assumption because of the customer telling me she closed the lid. I also already tried a SMC and PRAM reset."

After I tested for continuity, found both sides were beeping. As I pulled the probes away, the capacitor disintegrated. So I replaced with a new capacitor, and tested on an external monitor, then tested the display, and both worked! Thank you so very much!!"
