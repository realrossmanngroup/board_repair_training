Board came in initially with corrosion on U6500 and U6550. Replaced those, have replaced U7000 and Q7030, and Q7040 (due to PPBUS_G3H low). No shorts on PPBUS_G3H.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is 0.75 V and slowly increases. It's weird because it will keep increasing if I leave the probes on the board.\n\nSMBUS_SMC_5_G3H_SDA-3.29V\n\nSMBUS_SMC_5_G3H_SCL - 3.27V\n\nI have measured all inputs to U7000 and they all seem to be the correct voltages. I'm running out of ideas."}

Just posting what you asked.\n\nL6900 on both sides 0V( was 0 as well before shorting)\n\nR7020 0.08V after short, which is probably my current problem. Unsure of value before short."}
