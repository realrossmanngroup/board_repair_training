We are trying to help you without being in front of the board you are working on. The only way this is possible is if we receive accurate measurements from you. The advice we give you on what to replace, or what to do, directly correlates to whether you tell us 3.42v or 1.5v on a given line. There is no compromise here: newbie or not, basic multimeter proficiency is an absolute requirement before someone can do any type of component level board diagjosis or repair.\n\nFor example: a medical student may be a newbie to brain surgery, but it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect that they understand how to use a scalpel or administer general anesthetic. These two basic skillsets must be mastered before one can commence learning or taking part in brain surgery. The same way that, while you may be a newbie to component level board repair, we don't find it unreasonable that you be able to interpret & provide accurate multimeter measurements.\n\nIf any of these rules are a dealkiller, we will not close the forum, but highly suggest you unsubscribe. I don't mean this to be mean - but there's no one out there who is going to provide proper help if they can't make the reasonable demand of you that you provide accurate measurements for them to work with. We are upfront with the rules of this forum that while we are happy to provide you with a wealth of diagnostic troubleshooting advice, it [I]must [/I]be based on solid measurements.\n\nWhen <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.42v, it thinks the screen is open. When <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is below 3v, it thinks the screen is closed, which points to a bad sleep sensor, or corrosion under the SMC. When <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.42v, it points to a problem with the backlight circuit. We're going to tell you to do very different things based on the voltage you read on <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>, so it is imperative that this be correct!"
