It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",

Sometimes when I measure <TRANSISTOR>Q5040</TRANSISTOR>, pin 1 and pin 2 are both .522v and pin 3 is 3.3v, all stable. Other times, pin 2 cycles from .017v to .202v, and pin 1 cycles from .188v to .228v. Pin 3 (<SIGNAL>SMC_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL>) is stable all the time at 3.3v. Diode readings at <TRANSISTOR>Q5040</TRANSISTOR> match a working board. No battery connected of course, but a working board has 3.3v on all three pins of <TRANSISTOR>Q5040</TRANSISTOR>, so I assume I don't need a battery to figure out the issue that's present. Changed <TRANSISTOR>Q5040</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7940</CHIP> \"just because\".\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> missing scares me since it comes from the PCH. Any help appreciated--thank you in advance as always!"

            "message": "I have a bad habit of finding new information shortly after posting:\n\nI was looking over <TRANSISTOR>Q5040</TRANSISTOR> area on schematics and saw several signals come from (of course) the SMC, and combined with the inconsistent readings at <TRANSISTOR>Q5040</TRANSISTOR>, and finding no shorts to explain the cycling/bouncing signals, I decided to reflow the SMC. Low and behold <TRANSISTOR>Q5040</TRANSISTOR> readings stabilized and I got fan spin! Great. So now my question is this; could this have been cracked solder balls, or do you think the SMC is on the way out? I'd prefer to not replace it unnecessarily, but I've not seen cracked solder balls on the SMC on this model very often, so makes me think it may be failing. This is a customer mail-in repair, so might go ahead and replace it to be safe. Any input appreciated!\n\nThanks again!"
