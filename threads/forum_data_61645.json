            "message": "Hey all, had an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> come in liquid damaged. Cleaned some corrosion away from the area surrounding the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s and after that the board was working fine for a day. The next morning, went to go turn it on and it booted half way then the screen went black. Took the board back out of the case and found that every 4th or 5th time plugging in the USB-C charger it will turn on, otherwise it will sit at 4.95v 10mA. It only turns on if the SSD is removed though. Going to order in an SSD to have on hand anyway, but as far as the board goes I don't even know where to begin on something like this. Any help would be much appreciated!"
