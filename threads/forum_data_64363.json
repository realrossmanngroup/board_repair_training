Replugged the SSD - same behaviour - unplugged battery and tried without battery - boots up normal SSD is detected. \n\nPlugged the old battery back in and works normally, i've then ordered another battery from a different supplier which I received today popped that one in and again we have the flashing folder with a ? symbol.\n\nHas Apple now done something to disable battery swaps is what i'm now wondering? Or I just happen to have two faulty batteries from different suppliers?"

Battery as fitted has around 75% charge so is nowhere near a low level!\n\nI found a workaround where if I start the machine up with the charger only connected and then connect the battery up it continues to work and behave normally."
