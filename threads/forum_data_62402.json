            "message": "Hi,\ni got a MABP 15\" 2014 that came with some mechanical damage... looked like somebody scratched over the board and ripping out components to prevent it from beeing repaired.\nThe ripped off components were: <RESISTOR>R1412</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1440</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1996</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1995</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1178</RESISTOR>, L7360, L8760, L8710, L3095, <TRANSISTOR>Q3080</TRANSISTOR>. Some scratches are on the RAM chips <CHIP>U2350</CHIP> and <CHIP>U2550</CHIP>.\nThe rest of the board looks perfectly fine - the board was never removed from the case before and i dont see any further damage.\nI replaced all components but the board (board alone only with battery and DC connected) gives me fan spin for few seconds then powering off again, turning on again for few seconds, turning off again, and so on...\nI checked the big coils for shorts - didn't found any.\n\nAny clue what could cause this?\n\nThank you"
