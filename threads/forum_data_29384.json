Maybe the internal diagnostic test will report a back battery as well but I'm not 100% sure.\n(You can run CoconutBattery on a Guest Account by opening it from the Terminal if you don't have the customer's login)\n\nI assume the board looks ok and you're using an original charger?"}

Not charging over 30% is likely the battery though."}
