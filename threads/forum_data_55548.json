So set about having a look over the board. Tho and behold J4915 was burnt on pin 3 <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_KBDBKLT</SIGNAL>. I am a novice at macbook repairs but unclear how this being burnt caused no power on. But hey, changed the socket and put a new backlight sheet on and it now works. I have took a picture of the 2 offending components and the solder ball was there prior to removal from the logicboard. \n\nGo me for fixing something without asking for help, great confidence boost...."
