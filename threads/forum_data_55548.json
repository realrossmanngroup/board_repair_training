        "message":"Hi all, hope everyone had a good christmas\/ holiday. \nI want to share an experience, more for informational purposes. \n\nHad an A1502 820-4924 come in with no power. PP3V42_G3H and PPBUS_G3H were present. So set about having a look over the board. Tho and behold J4915 was burnt on pin 3 PPVOUT_S0_KBDBKLT. I am a novice at macbook repairs but unclear how this being burnt caused no power on. But hey, changed the socket and put a new backlight sheet on and it now works. I have took a picture of the 2 offending components and the solder ball was there prior to removal from the logicboard. \n\nGo me for fixing something without asking for help, great confidence boost...."
