        "820-2796": "What is 820-2796? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "U7201": "What is U7201? U7201 is responsible for the 3.3v and 5v power rails on many devices..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

Smoke was coming out of <TRANSISTOR>Q7260</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> was frying so I replace both. Now I have a green light on the charger, no orange. I do have orange when i connect a battery, not sure how these old ones work with regards to one wire circuit. Measure the following:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>     8.39\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>    3.4v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>      3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_LDO</SIGNAL>     5v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>       0v\n\n<CHIP>U6100</CHIP> looks very clean, gets 3.3v in.\n\n<CHIP>U7201</CHIP>\nPin 21 <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL>                   3.48v\nPin 4 <SIGNAL>P5VS3_EN</SIGNAL>                   0.204v\nPin 23 VIN                          8.39v\npin 12 <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL>       3.39v\nPin 25 SW2                       3.31\nPin 32 SW1                       0v\n\nResistors on S3 Rail Enables measure OK. <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> = 0.204\n\nAny suggestions please?"
