Burned trace between <RESISTOR>R6102</RESISTOR>/p1 and <CAPACITOR>C6100</CAPACITOR>/p1 fixed. <RESISTOR>R6102</RESISTOR> was replaced.\n\nThe fan is spinning but does not make the usual three times cycle. It starts spinning for 6-8 seconds. Then stops. Then starts again and keep spinning forever. On <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> SPI i got 3.3V on pins 1,2,3,8 all the time. Pin 7 is 3.0V all the time. Pins 5,6 only got 3.3V while fan is spinning the first time. After the fan stops and starts again voltage is not coming up on these two pins. \n\nI then tried flashing a new SPI chip but it did not help. Same issue so I have put the original one back.\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> = 3.4V\n<SIGNAL>PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL> = 3.4V\n\nWhat now?\n\nThanks"
