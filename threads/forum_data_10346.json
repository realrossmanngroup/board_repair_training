Burned trace between R6110\/p2 and R6120\/p1 fixed. Burned trace between R6102\/p1 and C6100\/p1 fixed. R6102 was replaced.\n\nThe fan is spinning but does not make the usual three times cycle. It starts spinning for 6-8 seconds. Then stops. Then starts again and keep spinning forever. On U6100 SPI i got 3.3V on pins 1,2,3,8 all the time. Pin 7 is 3.0V all the time. Pins 5,6 only got 3.3V while fan is spinning the first time. After the fan stops and starts again voltage is not coming up on these two pins. \n\nI then tried flashing a new SPI chip but it did not help. Same issue so I have put the original one back.\n\nPM_PCH_PWROK = 3.4V\nPM_PCH_SYS_PWROK = 3.4V\n\nWhat now?\n\nThanks"}

It was the BIOS after all. I missed it because I accidentally flashed an A-revision BIOS but it is a B-revision board. But because the A-revision BIOS made same issues as the corrupted original BIOS it trolled me. After flashing correct BIOS for 820-3437-B and updating ME it is running smoothly. Thanks again for your time and effort Mr Duke. Please mark solved."}
