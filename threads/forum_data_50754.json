        "message":"Hi all,\n\ngot a no power 820-00840.\n\nhistory is that it just stopped working, no signs of any liquid, Board is perfect. I get 20v on the charger so 3V3 is OK but 0 amps being drawn and 0v on PPBUS_G3H.\n\ni removed the fuse and get a 3.3ohm short to ground on pin 2.\n\nlooking around the only possible sign I saw was C7754 (cap for PP1V_OPC_S0) that had a solder ball by it. I removed it but same situation.\n\ni injected voltage at 5v into pin 2 but no amp draw and definitely nothing hot.\n\nany ideas?\n\nthanks"
