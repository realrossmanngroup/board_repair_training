    "definitions": {
        "820-01814": "What is 820-01814? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "C6406": "What is C6406? a CAPACITOR.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "D8410": "What is D8410? a DIODE.",
        "U8400": "What is U8400? a CHIP.",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created..",
        "R8450": "What is R8450? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q8401": "What is Q8401? a TRANSISTOR."
