It only pulls 5.16V from ampmeter. Client says that it was working on it, and it just turned off for no reason.\n\nAmpmeter stays at 5.16V on all 4 ports, and 0.02A.\n\nDiode readings from all 4 CD3215 on CC1\/2  are OK (0.590 ~ 0.600).\n\nPPBUS_G3H seams to be shorted (0.002 in diode reading).\n\nCanI inject 5V there (I thing its safe 5V, correct)? 1V doesn't heat nothing."}
