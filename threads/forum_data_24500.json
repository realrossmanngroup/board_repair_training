            "message": "Had a 000165 come from another shop, they already USC'd it. Apparently there was liquid damage. The only evidence I see of this is a corroded probe point (TP{1}<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB</SIGNAL>), and some stuff around <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>. Changed <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>, all pads looked good, tested continuity on ones in questions, they were fine. Put new one on and still the charger alternates green then orange at 3 second intervals, no chime, no display, no backlight, no fan.\n\n0V on backlight pins (of course, its not powering on).\nO.L on <SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> (screen connected and disconnected)\n\nI should mention that there was display, chime and fan before changing out the <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP>... Didnt just do it for the fun of it.\n\nIdeas?"
