Apparently there was liquid damage. The only evidence I see of this is a corroded probe point (TP{1}PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT_FB), and some stuff around U7701. Changed U7701, all pads looked good, tested continuity on ones in questions, they were fine. Put new one on and still the charger alternates green then orange at 3 second intervals, no chime, no display, no backlight, no fan.\n\n0V on backlight pins (of course, its not powering on).\nO.L on PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT (screen connected and disconnected)\n\nI should mention that there was display, chime and fan before changing out the LP8550... Didnt just do it for the fun of it.\n\nIdeas?"}
