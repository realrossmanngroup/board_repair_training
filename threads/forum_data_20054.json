            "message": "Hello,\n\nThis board has no liquid damage. It had intermittent kernel panics and shutdowns until I addressed bad solder joints at <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>. \nIt is failing diagnostics with sensor error TW0P, which I think is airport proximity temp. Fans do not spin on high, however.\nI checked for 3.3V at <CHIP>U5523</CHIP> and <CHIP>U5570</CHIP>. Replaced <CHIP>U5570</CHIP> to test, no changes to behavior. Checked data lines <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_1_S0_SDA</SIGNAL> and SCL, no oscilloscope available but fluctuations on those lines indicate that there is some kind of modulation (data?) on those lines. \nAny thoughts? Replacing <CHIP>U5523</CHIP> will be a pain due to connectors in that area, would it be better to bottom heat?\nOr is it the SMC?\n\nThanks,\n\nStefan"
