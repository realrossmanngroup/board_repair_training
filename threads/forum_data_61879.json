This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad. Each CD3215 in the system needs to be functioning in order for any of them to speak to the charger and negotiate receiving 20v from the charger rather than the default 5v that a USB-C charger puts out before communicating with the system. .",

So it is normal to show a short circuit with the ground. I removed the UB300 in vain. I understand you didn't check. It escaped my notice.\n\n2.\nWhen I look at the schematic, it says <RESISTOR>R3033</RESISTOR> is not in place. But <RESISTOR>R3033</RESISTOR> is in place and shows short circuit. the diagram shows the value as 100k. I did not understand this situation. Is it normal for it to be short circuited or should I replace it with another 100k resistor? I added the pictures about it\n Also, when UB300 and UB400 are not in place, will the device turn on via other usb? Or do they absolutely have to be?"
