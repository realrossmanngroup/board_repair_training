At first it would work intermittently and now not at all. the usb A port is working perfectly.\n\ni am getting 5v on pin one of j4700, I couldn't find a short to ground but when measuring pins 2 and 3 i had .0L on them which is different from the other port. i do have continuity from the pins to 3-4 of d4700, also I'm getting 3.4v on pin 3-4 and 0.198v on pins 2-5 of d4700.\n\nany ideas?"}
