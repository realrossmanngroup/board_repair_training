            "message": "I'm working on this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330B</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that had a previous usb port not working. now the other port has stopped working. At first it would work intermittently and now not at all. the usb A port is working perfectly.\n\ni am getting 5v on pin one of j4700, I couldn't find a short to ground but when measuring pins 2 and 3 i had .0L on them which is different from the other port. i do have continuity from the pins to 3-4 of <DIODE>D4700</DIODE>, also I'm getting 3.4v on pin 3-4 and 0.198v on pins 2-5 of <DIODE>D4700</DIODE>.\n\nany ideas?"

            "message": "thanks for the reply. upon checking for the diode measurements (all were good) i decided to check continuity on L4700 and noticed i had a connection to the top of the inductor but not the bottom. looked like there was a break in the trace that went from bottom of the inductor to the top. kinda strange. repealed and replaced all is working great again. \n\nThanks again louis.
