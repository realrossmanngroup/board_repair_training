        "message":"I have this board that doesn't look to have any liquid damage and is stuck at 5v and 0.21amps on all 4 ports. There isn't any boot loop just a steady 5v. I was getting 1.4v on PP3v3_G3H and so far I have replaced U6903, R6910-13, C6910\/11\/13\/15\/16 and D6902 . \n\nI still get the same voltage but I noticed when I remove R6915 from the board I get 3.39v on PP3v3_G3H but I still get 5v on the charger but 0amps this time. When I put R6915 back on it goes to the original issue. \n\nI visually inspected all the CD3215 chips and there doesn't look to be any damage to any of them or around them."
