After UC I found a couple of broken lines and jumped them.\n\nThe system now gives green light, chimes, can see boot options with USB drive (the owner did not provide the internal SSD) but there is no backlight.\n\nI measure  PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT = 52,4V at pin1 of the LVDS connector.\n\nI also booted with USB drive to Yosemite without issues and the external monitor properly shows the desktop.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nbr,\ngeorge"
