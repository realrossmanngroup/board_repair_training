Pin 43 and 1 of the display connector appeared burnt. I've resolved this a few times before with replacing u9850.\n\nThis time I replaced u9850 and tested with the display - nothing. Removed the connector and noticed further burning around 43 & 1 of the display board connector and cable. Assuming there was still a short someone after the display cable. \n\nReplaced u9850 again and tried a fresh cable and known good display - nothing again. Replaced u9850 a second time with the same result. \n\nI've read but never experienced u9800 also failing with u9850. Is it possible I fried this too or something else?"}
