My hat's off to you.\n\nI'm working on an A2159 board which is not booting or showing any signs of life. \n\nTesting all the main power rails PPv20, PPv5, PP3v3, etc. I'm not getting more than 0.3V. anywhere. \nThere are no shorts on any of these main power rails. \n\nMy assumption at this point is that the USB-C board is the culprit, but is there something else I might be missing?"}
