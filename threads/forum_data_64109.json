Got this board here. It turns on, charges battery, works perfectly except for left USB ports. They can charge battery via USB-C but no USB devices get detected on them, not even get power from USB on USB mouse or any other device. The board had corrosion near U3500\/5850\/3906 which I cleaned and verified traces and components surrounding, but still same behavior. Where can I start?"}
