They can charge battery via USB-C but no USB devices get detected on them, not even get power from USB on USB mouse or any other device. The board had corrosion near <CHIP>U3500</CHIP>/5850/3906 which I cleaned and verified traces and components surrounding, but still same behavior. Where can I start?"
