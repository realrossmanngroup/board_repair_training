    "definitions": {
        "820-01987": "What is 820-01987? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8400": "What is U8400? a CHIP.",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created..",
        "BKLT_SDA": "What is BKLT_SDA? BKLT_SDA is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",
        "PP5V_S0_BKLT_A": "What is PP5V_S0_BKLT_A? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP5V_S0_BKLT_D": "What is PP5V_S0_BKLT_D? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_SW": "What is LCDBKLT_SW? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN": "What is LCDBKLT_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_R": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_FB": "What is LCDBKLT_FB? LCDBKLT_FB is a feedback line between backlight output and the feedback pin on the LED driver. When this connection is broken, backlight output will be equal to PPBUS_G3H voltage of the system rather than boosting. Since this point is the highest voltage in the system, it is the fastest to corrode when liquid damaged, so it is a very common point to check when there is no backlight. .",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "R8431": "What is R8431? a RESISTOR.",
        "R8433": "What is R8433? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q8401": "What is Q8401? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "D8410": "What is D8410? a DIODE.",
