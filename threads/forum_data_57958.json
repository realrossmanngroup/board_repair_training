It originally had only 5v on the charger and I replaced UB300/400 and also had to replace the resistors around UB090 and run a wire from CB090 to RB090 to restore 20v. Still did not boot due to a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. Found that PPBUS was shorted to ground through CA325. This whole area looked bad so I replaced CA325 and QA300. The board then turned on but had high fan spin on the left fan only. This was because <TRANSISTOR>Q6000</TRANSISTOR> was missing from the board. Replaced that and also has to replace one of the hall sensors because it was damaged. The board boots now and seems to run normally except for a few issues. The main issue is that the internal display only has backlight and no image. I tested with a known good full assembly and had the same issue. External display works fine. It also take a long time to boot into the OS (about 3 minutes). The keyboard backlight also does not come on when you first boot the computer, but does come on if I close the lid and re-open it. Seems like this would be a issue with <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> but the voltages seem normal. I replaced <CHIP>U9850</CHIP> to try and fix the image issues but that did not help. Still have just backlight on the LCD. Here are some of the voltages I got for the screen.\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL> - 5.1\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>PANEL_FET_EN_DLY</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n<SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n<SIGNAL>BUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n<SIGNAL>BUF_SMC_REST_L</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n<SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_SMC_RST_L</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n<SIGNAL>DP_INT_HPD</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID_RIGHT</SIGNAL> - 3.4\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID_LEFT</SIGNAL> - 3.4"
