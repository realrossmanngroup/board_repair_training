Anyways, i think i ordered the correct ram (not sure becuase the video wasn't that high quality) and followed the same resistor swap.  now am getting beeps on startup.\n\nRam i ordered: [URL]https://www.ebay.com/itm/313627948809?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649[/URL]\nvideo i followed: [MEDIA=youtube]RgEfMzMxX5E[/MEDIA]\n\nagain, if you could help me out i would very much appreciate it."
