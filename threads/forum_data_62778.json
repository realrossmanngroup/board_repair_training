I've been done 8gb but these days on newer os they are running pretty slow.  I have a 4gb 00165that customer sold to me instead of fixing and wanted to upgrade to 16gb if possible.  If it can which ram type do i need?"}

Anyways, i think i ordered the correct ram (not sure becuase the video wasn't that high quality) and followed the same resistor swap.  now am getting beeps on startup.\n\nRam i ordered: [URL]https:\/\/www.ebay.com\/itm\/313627948809?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649[\/URL]\nvideo i followed: [MEDIA=youtube]RgEfMzMxX5E[\/MEDIA]\n\nagain, if you could help me out i would very much appreciate it."}
