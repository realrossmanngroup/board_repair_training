Don't own a fake. I tried both shorting the pads at <RESISTOR>R5015</RESISTOR> (without keyboard cable inserted) and using the power button with the cable inserted. <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> is at 3.4V.\nI swapped the magsafe to rule that out - no change.\n\nFurther: According to the customer the problem started out of the blue, no moisture damage spotted on the board or inside the laptop, though I havent completely disassembled it. It was fairly dusty at the fans (smoker), but not clogged up and the fans still spin ok by hand.\n\nedit: seems green charger light switching off as mentioned earlier might just have been due to an imperfect connection between charger and magsafe board. I havent seen the light turn off anymore."

Going to let it charge a little longer, but right now there is no fan spin when trying to power it up with the battery in (tried with magsafe in and out). Not very hopeful.\nCan I check wheter its the SMC or MCP somehow? The SMC I could probably replace, though I'm still waiting for my jig to show up from China and have yet to do my first replacement, but it should wind up here eventually."
