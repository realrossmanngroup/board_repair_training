Now I still have no power but on PPBUS_G3H I have 500mV and slowly rising up to 1+V. Never seen behavior like that so not sure what to do or go after next. Checked all points for PPBUS_G3H they all show the same number. When I disconnect power and a minute later reconnect it, it picks up where it left off, only dropping a few mV so the charge is being kept somewhere, just don't understand the behavior."}

The enable signal is coming in at 8.38V which is correct as far as I can tell.\n\nL7130 gives me 8.6V on both sides.\nF7700 also 8.6V on both sides.\n\nGoing to look for a Q5500 replacement and report back."}
