Is there anything else I should look for before letting this go? The board looks mostly clean, but the customer reported it as a spill. <RESISTOR>R7202</RESISTOR> looks like it probably got hit. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING</SIGNAL> wasn't shorted. Board is cycling. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is cycling. Fan will occasionally spin up when power is applied."
