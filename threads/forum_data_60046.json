This is my first repair on a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00875</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>.\nCustomer report no power after a small water spill near trackpad.\nWhen I connect usb-c 61w power unit, fan starts and spin at lightspeed. Nothing else happens.\nAfter checking power lines found that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is missing (0,6v).\nFound some corrosion under <CHIP>U8220</CHIP>, <SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3S0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_S0R</SIGNAL> are present and stable.\nI've tried to clean/resolder <CHIP>U8220</CHIP> but no success, still 0,6v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>.\nCan <CHIP>U8220</CHIP> be burned? it looks perfect... I should try to bypass it and inject 3v3 on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> and see what happens?\nThank you in advance. (y)"
