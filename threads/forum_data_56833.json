No liquid damage, and it is very clean. \n\nThe issue is when it boots to OS the screen gets distorted but shows fine during boot up. If I plug in an external monitor the external monitor displays fine and also makes the internal display fine. Once the external monitor is disconnected the issue comes back on the internal LCD. I checked the thunderbolts ports and they are very clean. I also tested the board in a perfect working MacBook and the problem persists. Is this a CPU issue?\n\nI made a video to show the problem. \n\n[url]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1voSTjVO6Z2y2OGFJNzVoLTWf84gINCgB\/view?usp=sharing[\/url]\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated. \n\n-Thomas"}
