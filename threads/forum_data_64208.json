            "message": "My second post yay. \nAlright so i have another <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2338</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with liquid damage. This machine is confusing. Initially it was 5v 0.05a. So checked <SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> and it was 0.7 v. Figured maybe shorted so injected voltage around 1v on f5200, got no power consumption. Plugged it in and then machine booted. As i went down the testing ladder it seems the machine will always attempt to boot make a chine and then reboot and be successful. This will happen each time. Aside from this issue the battery isnt charging. While diagnosing the battery not charging <TRANSISTOR>Q5155</TRANSISTOR> wasn't acting right. After replacing it and connected device. It did the boot and then reboot, charged the battery for a couple of seconds and then the amperage dropped, starting charging and then repeated the same behavior for a 10 seconds and then stopped charging again and hasn't since.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> is 12.01 v after it started working again.\n\nWhat to do?"

It has about a 1v on it.\n\nAlso checked ppbus aon. \nAt one point was 10.35v however the most consistent i can get is starts off at 12.30 then drops to 12.01 reboots. Starts at 12.30 and then stays at 12.01."

What are you're thoughts on the restarts while booting to then successfully boot and ppbus aon being 12.01 v. I will let you know about my battery findings later.\nThis behavior to me isn't normal. Also to elaborate on when i said the device charged the battery for about 30 secs. It wasn't a consistent charge. The amerpage would go upto 2.4a and the drop to 0.20a and did that multiple times with a 5 sec gap in between and then altogether stopped."
