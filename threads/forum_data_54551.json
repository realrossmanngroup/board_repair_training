        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",

        "SPI_MOSI": "What is SPI_MOSI? SPI_MOSI is a signal between the CPU or PCH and the SPI ROM bios chip that is necessary for the machine to POST and boot. If this signal line is corroded or the BIOS chip has failed then you will not get PM_SLP_S4_L and the machine will not boot. Very often this line is corroded by liquid damage. .",
