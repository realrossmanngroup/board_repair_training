            "message": "This isn't about a specific board, but I have been inundated with 2015 <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> units with display issues. They either have no backlight, no display activity at all, or intermittent issues. A lot of them seem to be resolved with PRAM resets/reseating the display connector, but there are still an inordinate amount of 2015 13\" units coming in with no liquid damage, no drop damage, and no display. When I check the boards, they're fine, but no video. About half the time, the display magically reappears after removing/reinstalling the board into our test unit then back into customer machines.\n\nI know Apple introduced new displays for the 2015 models and there are EDID differences that cause earlier LCD assemblies to not work with the 2015 model. Is this same \"change\" responsible for the incredibly finicky nature of the display working/not-working? If you search eBay for 2015 13\" LCD displays, you'll see a lot for sale as \"no display\", etc.\n\nWhat gives? Has anyone noticed this, and have you figured anything out? Each time I see one come into the shop with no liquid and no display, I get a little aggravated because I know it's most likely this random failure of display.\n\nJust curious if anyone else has experienced it."

You can have a spill that's not remotely close to the LCD connector and it will still find a way of failing. It's as if they're using fuse wire in the cable, which they might be. I've found the issue in a few of the Retina models, but definitely the 13\" is where I really notice it most. And the cables are interchangeable between <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> 13\" and 15\" models and easy to replace which is convenient."
