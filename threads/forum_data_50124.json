More liquid at <RESISTOR>R7180</RESISTOR>, replaced and <CAPACITOR>C7400</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7425</CAPACITOR>, resoldered <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> as pin 12 had a tiny bit of corrosion on it.\n\nThe boards now gets green and orange light, I have 3.3v and a 5.1v pulse at <CAPACITOR>C7518</CAPACITOR>. PPVRTC = 3.3v. On <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> I got 3.3v and area looks clean. <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> has 3.4v and <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> pulses at 3.3v but goes to 0. CPU Vcore also pulses. I cannot find any shorts. I did replace <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> but situation is the same. <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> has 32mhz clock. Ideas?"
