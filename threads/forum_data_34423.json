Cleaned out the thunderbolt ports and It has green light switching to Orange.\nFan spins in SMC Bypass and spins in normal boot once the cpu get warm. CPU gets warm but not hot. Backlight turns on and I have LCD Power but I have no image and no chime.\nDoes not output anything on HDMI and does not boot to USB.\nCPU mosfets both show correct power going to CPU when backlight is on. \n\nIs the Intel chip dead on the GPU side or is there something else that may cause these symptoms."}
