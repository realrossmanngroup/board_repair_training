I have a Flir One Pro LT and the attached shows the fuse and Q7706 glowing. Looking around the area C7799 was discoloured so I have replaced it. I have removed Q7706 and still get the short. the amperage is 0.24A and I now get a green light on the charger which I never got prior. I replaced U7701. Any ideas ?"
