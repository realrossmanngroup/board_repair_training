GAVE UP WAITING FOR DEVICE TO TRANSITION FROM DFU STATE TO DFU STATE,\n\nPlease note that the board is stuck on 5V, with no liquid damage, that's why am trying to restore it.\n\nI would also like to know if the issue is other than the T2 chip, will I be able to get the device into DFU MODE at all ? I mean if for example, there is an issue with one or more of the  CD32, will I still be able to get the device into DFU MODE?"

Also measure in diode mode of all LDO lines (power off) of CD32s. check if there is no odd readings.\n\nThen follow the start-up sequence to ascertain how far the board boots. This is good to understand how these boards work.\n\nIf you cant get the firmware on there, the board is scrap. My repair rate of this stuff is down to about 40% and heading downwards. A small amount of liquid firmly kills these boards for good."
