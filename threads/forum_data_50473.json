        "820-3787": "What is 820-3787? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U4801": "What is U4801? a CHIP.",

        "Z2_CLKIN": "What is Z2_CLKIN? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7121": "What is R7121? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

        "U5701": "What is U5701? this is the keyboard controller chip that takes the keyboard and trackpad input and turns it into a USB device signal for the machine to process. If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. ."

After that it worked, Trackpad working, keyboard wrote what it want. Then with a new Akku I noticed that It consumed 4-6A, after that I limited the curent to 3,5\n\nI found that <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>/22 are bad. After replacing current was normal (about 3.4A not rising anymore)\n\nNow I found that the damaged <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> burned a hole in the Keyboard cable until the metal of the keyboard.\n\nSo I replaced the keyboard. But still the same problem.\n\nI tryed another mainboard in the same case, now keyboard and trackpad is working well.\n\n\nI dont know why but the keyboard and trackpad is not working anymore.\n\nI found on J4800  Pin 22 and 18 has power,\nPin 20 <SIGNAL>Z2_CLKIN</SIGNAL> nothing\n\nSo I checked U 4801 and found in diode mode Pin 23-28 nothing.\n\nI replaced <CHIP>U4801</CHIP>, Diode mode all pins ok now.J4800 Pin 20 has clock now. But no trackpad ( I disconnected the keyboard and only try to get trackpad until now)\n\nthen I found in the forum that duke wrote <CHIP>U4801</CHIP> needs only power and usb and as to show up in the osx. I tryed with a good mainboard first. internal keyboard and trackpad is shown up.\n\nwith the problem board it shows nothing. In diode mode I get on <RESISTOR>R4801</RESISTOR>/02 both sides the same reading (good and bad board)\n\n<RESISTOR>R4801</RESISTOR> has 3.13V, <RESISTOR>R4802</RESISTOR> 0V. On the good board it has 0V as well\n\nThe <CHIP>U4801</CHIP> is programmed. I took it from a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. Pinout is the same. may be there is no comunication?\n\nExternal keyboard and mouse is working good\n\nNeed some help please"

I will check that.\nThe Pinout is the same, I tryed the board with an mid 2012 retina trackpad but no way.\nIf there is a different then has the <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> a problem in comunication with USB, but USB should be the same protocol.\n\nFor me is intresting that I have on <RESISTOR>R4802</RESISTOR> 0V also on the good board. I expected there signals like on <RESISTOR>R4801</RESISTOR>. Or is that because its differntial and no comunication, means one line has 3.13V, high pegel and the other has low pegel?"
