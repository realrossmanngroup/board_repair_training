Plug in USB drive with flashing light at first then turns off, flashing reappears, then off. Removed display, LED 1 and two come on, 3 doesn't and 4 is off I assume because no display connected? is that right? \n\nThis machine has the NVIDIA n13E-GTX-W-A2\n\nI've heard if LED 3 is off that means bad GPU? correct?"}
