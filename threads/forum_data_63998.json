            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-02020</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> which has suffered liquid but still turns on and working fine apart from the Wi-Fi greyed out. The damage was near to the WiFi chip. I replaced UL001 & CL071 as they were both corroded. Also noticed that the TP for <SIGNAL>WLBT_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> was damaged so i've ran a trace from JL103 to the TP. this now reads the correct diode reading but it only gives me 0.4v. \n\nOn further investigation the signal to turn this on comes from <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> so i presume that is faulty. \n\nMy question is can the <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> be replaced? I would have to try and find a brand new one as i don't have a stencil.\n\nNot sure what the enable voltage should be and if anyone knows this would help, I could inject the voltage to see if the Wi-FI starts to work before tackling the <CHIP>U8100</CHIP>"
