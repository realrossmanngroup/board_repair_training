The damage was near to the WiFi chip. I replaced UL001 & CL071 as they were both corroded. Also noticed that the TP for WLBT_PWR_EN was damaged so i've ran a trace from JL103 to the TP. this now reads the correct diode reading but it only gives me 0.4v. \n\nOn further investigation the signal to turn this on comes from U8100 so i presume that is faulty. \n\nMy question is can the U8100 be replaced? I would have to try and find a brand new one as i don't have a stencil.\n\nNot sure what the enable voltage should be and if anyone knows this would help, I could inject the voltage to see if the Wi-FI starts to work before tackling the U8100"}
