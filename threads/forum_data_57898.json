            "message": "Hello. So I have on the bench an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that came in because the camera is not being recognized. I tried a known good test screen with another camera but it still says the same thing. I measured for <SIGNAL>PP1V2_CAM</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V35_CAM</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP1V8_CAM</SIGNAL> and they all seem to be present. I am also getting the I2C voltages at the camera connector. I will say this board has been worked on previously by someone else. the edge bonding is gone from SMC, and J6100 is removed. Any advice would be appreciated. The customer is insistent on having a camera."
