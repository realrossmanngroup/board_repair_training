        "message":"Computer is liquid damaged, after cleaning it gives green then red light, no fan spin though. Found a short on PPVCC_SO_CPU. Looking at the schematic there looks to be many caps, the processor and C1031. Is there anything else that could be on that line causing the short or is it the processor? There is a lot if evidence that liquid has been on and around it.\nThanks"
