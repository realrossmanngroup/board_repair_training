        "message":"Hi,\n\nI've a liquid damaged 820-3115.\nThe liquid damage was around SMC and PP3V42_G3H.\n\nI had to change the SMC, because there was no green light.\nAfter I replaced the SMC this macbook was working fine.\nHowever after few hours it turned off and the green light went off.\n\nThere was a short on PP3V42_G3H (40 ohm short).\nI hooked up my PSU give it 1V and 1A. It drew 0.8A and nicely went down to 0A in 10sec or less.\nSo of course I couldn't find the shorted component. It's not like something blown.... the short just was gone.\n\nWell, after an hour the problem is back. The macbook turns off and on. It starts booting and turns off and on.\nSometimes as soon as the white screen comes on sometimes after it booted. It does the some thing on my desk without anything attached.\nI tried different DC-IN board.\n\nI have a low resistance on PP3V42_G3H. It's now 400 Ohm. What could this be? I guess it's a leaking cap just the question is how the hell I'm gonna find it?\n\nThanks."
