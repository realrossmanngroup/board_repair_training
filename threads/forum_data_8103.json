It drew 0.8A and nicely went down to 0A in 10sec or less.\nSo of course I couldn't find the shorted component. It's not like something blown.... the short just was gone.\n\nWell, after an hour the problem is back. The macbook turns off and on. It starts booting and turns off and on.\nSometimes as soon as the white screen comes on sometimes after it booted. It does the some thing on my desk without anything attached.\nI tried different DC-IN board.\n\nI have a low resistance on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>. It's now 400 Ohm. What could this be? I guess it's a leaking cap just the question is how the hell I'm gonna find it?\n\nThanks."
