All components in the area measure correct but I am not getting <SIGNAL>LCD_PSR_EN</SIGNAL>.\nCan someone tell me what the PCH needs to output that signal, or any information on how this circuit works would help.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike"

If there is no LCD detected it will go low again. So you cannot just check these signals after you turned it on. Check for a pulse on <SIGNAL>PSR_EN</SIGNAL>, preferably with a scope as multimeter may be too slow to catch. Check soldering on <CHIP>U8330</CHIP> again and check if 3V is on pin 8."
