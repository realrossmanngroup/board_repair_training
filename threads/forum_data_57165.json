The connector looks like it was scrapped maybe burned before and I did continuity on connector all pins. All have continuity to there external pins. I also checked  continuity from\nL3404 pin 1 to j3404 pins 22,24,26,28,30,29 all have continuity. \nL3404 has 3.3 on both pins 1 and 2 \n3.3v is getting to pin 22,24,26,28,30,29\nso even though the connector doesn?t look great it still is conducting. I?ve change both WiFi airport and cable of known working units."}
