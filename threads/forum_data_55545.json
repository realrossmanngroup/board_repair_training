        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",

I am missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>. When I power it on, the current spikes to .452A then drops to 26mA. Seems to me like it is trying to power on then shutting down. I checked some power rails but these boards I get with this issue and no apparent corrosion anywhere are baffling. I have 2 of them."
