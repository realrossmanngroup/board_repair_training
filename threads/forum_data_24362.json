After cleaning had no light on the charger and no fans so I went ahead and proceeded to fix the onewire circuit which had both the 10k and 4.7k resistor blown. Light is back again but now with a quarter fan spin. <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> area looks nearly spotless and I checked all the surrounding resistors. Pin 8 of <CHIP>U8160</CHIP> also looks good and has voltage. Any tips on what to look for next? <SIGNAL>3V3_S3</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>3V3_S0</SIGNAL> are coming and going as the fan spins and turns back off but the S5 remains stable."
