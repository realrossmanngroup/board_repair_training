        "message":"Liquid damaged Air board with most corrosion being around SMC area. Ultrasonic cleaned that up very well. After cleaning had no light on the charger and no fans so I went ahead and proceeded to fix the onewire circuit which had both the 10k and 4.7k resistor blown. Light is back again but now with a quarter fan spin. U6100 area looks nearly spotless and I checked all the surrounding resistors. Pin 8 of U8160 also looks good and has voltage. Any tips on what to look for next? 3V3_S3 and 3V3_S0 are coming and going as the fan spins and turns back off but the S5 remains stable."
