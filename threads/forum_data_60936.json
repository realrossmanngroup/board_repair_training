        "SMC_LID_RIGHT": "What is SMC_LID_RIGHT? SMC_LID_RIGHT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the right LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_RIGHT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
        "PP3V3_S0SW_LCD": "What is PP3V3_S0SW_LCD? PP3V3_S0SW_LCD is a 3.3v power rail necessary to power the image circuitry on the screen. This is necessary to get a picture on the screen. .",

        "LID_CTRL_DMIC": "What is LID_CTRL_DMIC? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "5V_S0SW_LCD": "What is 5V_S0SW_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. ."
