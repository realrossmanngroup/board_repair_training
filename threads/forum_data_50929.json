I replace it and also Q7225, U7201 but it didn't help. \nI think the problem is PM_SLP_S4_L - 0V but can't find out why it is not there, rail is not shorted I check main rails they are not shorted. \nAlso I was checking for PP1V05_S5, U7740 is not fitted on main board by manufacture but is present on schematic diagram. where I should measure this voltage than couldn't find this rail.\nThanks for any help."}

Im not sure is not connected to this rail or its not present because I can't find place where it is generated or where else to measure it.."}
