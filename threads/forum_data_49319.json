        "message":"Hello, I have an 820-3209 that was working and suddenly stopped (its our mac). Got green and orange light. After inspection saw some corrosion near U7600, replaced C7601, R7641, R7642 and R2801. Now i got all voltages upto 0.9v, including 1.05v on L7630. Whats missing is power on L7550 PPVCORE_S0_CPU. I got 8.4v on Q7550 pin 1. What else should be present for this to work?\n\nOn U7400 pin 1 I got 0.008v, that should be 3.3v to enable? CPUIMVP_TON is 8.39 measuring OK\nAt Q9750 I measure as follows:\nPin 1 = 0.7v (should be 1.05v?\nPin 3 = 0.086 Pin 4 same\nPin 7 = 0.75v\nPin 6 = 3.25v\nPin 5 = 0.48v"
