            "message": "MacBook Air came up with liquid damage near clock/bios chip, not starting.\nThis is 2017 model with 1.8Ghz, 8GB RAM.\n\nBios was already replaced by the previous shop with a 2015 bios version. Came back unfixed.\nClock chip area was seriously messed up by liquid. I had to run many wires and replace the clock chip and got the board to start.\n\nNow I am not getting no camera detected and that's usually the symptom of a bad ME Region. I did try 3 times to clean ME but apparently with no success.\nI am not great with cleaning ME region usually so it's possible that my Bios is still messy.\nCould someone upload one version of a 2017 version <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> Bios with a clean ME please?\n\nSince the clock area was messed, I've checked for continuity on PP1V2_CAM_XTALPCIEVDD but it's fine.\nI am getting the <SIGNAL>CAM_SENSOR_WAKE_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>CAMERA_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> at 3.3V and I've checked different rails near the Broadcom chip and they all seem to be present.\n\nI need to rule out first the ME region issue so please share a clean dump if you have one.\nThanks."

In other words, this OP says board came in with BIOS already replaced, so the BIOS original to the board is lost/unavailable. In my experience with boards that have no iSight post-ME-cleaning, it's impossible to resolve without original BIOS/ME/FSYS. Can Medusa resolve this? If so, would you mind shooting me a message quickly? I have a few questions I'd like to ask you about Medusa, since you're experienced with it. :)"
