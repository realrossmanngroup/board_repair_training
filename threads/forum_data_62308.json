I get image on external screen but not on internal. I have tested on other known good display without any image. Testet in known good housing as well - no luck. On the old MB you easily see if it is backlight. But not anymore:).\nAny suggestions where to look first? I looked at schematics but I can not find any issues. Thank you in advanced."
