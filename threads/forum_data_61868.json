        "message":"I'm working on a 820-01041-A with no picture. I found liquid damage on a view areas of the logicboard and on the board of the display. The flex-connector on the display-board (TConn) and the flexcable was damaged\/scorched on the left and right side. I changed the connector and the flex. The connector on the logicboard have no damage.\n\nThe liquid spills on the logicboard was not very badly - i cleaned it all. These are the areas ...\nAlong the outer edge under L7221, U7220, QA340, QA650.\nUnder U7800 the caps C7818 to C7846.\nC7254, U7370 and R7370.\n\nHere are my measurements ...\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.35v\nDP_INT_HPD = 3.3v\nLCD_MUX_EN = 3.32v\nPP5V_S0SW_LCD = 5.13v\nPP5V_S0_ALSCAM_F = 5.13\nPP3V3_S0SW_LCD = 3.36v\nEDP_PANEL_PWR_EN = 3.35V\n\nIs this a display issue? Or could U9850 be the problem? I have not yet changed U9850.\nThanks for any help."
