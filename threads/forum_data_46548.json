            "message": "Working on a frustrating <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board with symptoms that are...not ideal:\n\n1. Board powers briefly and all rails (<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> & VCORE included) pulse for <1 second.\n2. Brief fan spin accompanies power pulse, then nothing. Fan stops, all rails after S5 drop completely (S5 rails remain present/steady), no power.\n3. No shorts found; VRTC present.\n4. Tried a known-good (bootable) generic BIOS and no change. I use this BIOS to test with all 00165 boards with similar symptoms, so the BIOS is good. Didn't work, so replaced original BIOS.\n5. <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> very clean, tried another to be sure, no change.\n6. There was one tiny spot of liquid to <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>, so I replaced it even though all pins measured properly on the old <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>.\n7. I suspected SMC at first (due to liquid to <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>), but since all my rails pulse, and my <SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL> (<SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL>, etc) remains when all other rails drop out, and ppbus is proper, I don't think the SMC is the culprit. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong in this assumption.\n8. I did test board with battery connected, as I've seen some people claim the 00165 sometimes needs battery connected (have never, ever experienced this, but tried it anyway).\n9. Since the board does not cycle (it powers for split second, then off), I'd more suspect an issue with a <SIGNAL>RESET_L</SIGNAL> signal possibly, instead of a shorted rail. I'd suspect a cycling symptom if the issue was a short.\n\nI'm out of ideas. The brief pulse gives me hope the CPU isn't dead, but I'm wondering if the PCH is bad. No liquid to VRTC area or SPI area at all. Checked typical <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>/area for any signs if damage, but nothing. Strongly leaning towards PCH on this one...but hope I'm wrong! :)\n\nAny help appreciated."

Confident the issue isn't the SMC, but went ahead and replaced it to eliminate, and no change. Exact same behavior.\n\nSuspecting PCH at this point. I also noted that <SIGNAL>PL_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is 0v and <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL> is .05v. I do believe <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL> should be 3.3v, but unsure if this results from <SIGNAL>3V3_S0</SIGNAL>, which is missing anyway. SMC puts out <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL>, but since we've eliminated SMC, I'd suspecting <CHIP>U0500</CHIP> at this point. Not going to spend too much more time on this one, since symptoms are so atypical.\n\nAny other final ideas appreciated!"

You can assume it won't be an \"obvious\" or simple thing like wrong charger or JTAG...we know to check all of this. I just want to prevent the preliminary back-and-forth posts about the basic things and get into the meat of the issue.\n\nPins 3/7 pulse as well; as mention, ALL signals (including <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS</SIGNAL>) pulse immediately, then drop. Everything after SUS disappears immediately after the pulse. Fan spins for a split second, then nothing.\n\nCan you explain why <SIGNAL>PL_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL> are both low? Wouldn't this result in the board being reset constantly (and thus no power)? Thanks in advance."
