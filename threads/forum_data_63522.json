WIFI and Bluetooth work fine.\nOn the other hand when I run the ASD 3S162, I got errors on load test and airport test, see attached (ignore the first sensor group error, I simply did not have the DC in)\n\nI replaced the WIFI card, I\/O board, I\/O connector, with the same results.\n\nAny idea about what can generate these errors?"
