SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. ."

I get how the one wire works for Pro but for air seems to work different? I remember that I saw a vid from Lewis about it but i cant find it. If you can point me in the right direction I can check it first myself. Tips also welcome as customer needs to leave Thailand tomorrow and its 12AM so I have only one night to get it fixed :)"
