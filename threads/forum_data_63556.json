This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",

On the connector on the logicboard I get a good diode measurement (0.507) but when I connect the small lcd flex cable I get a O/L on the other side... So the LCD doesn't get a connection! \n\nTried different Flex cables but when I use another one I don't get image.  Is there a difference between the M1 small lcd flex cable and the once before the m1?\n\nTo bad I only have 1 M1 here, so can't check... Maybe I can try to repair the flex cable?!\n\nCould this be the reason why <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> is low?"
