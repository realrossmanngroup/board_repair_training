        "message":"HI,\nI have an  A1534 820-00244 that has no power.\n\nAt first it pulled 19.9V from ampmetter, but no amp.\nI notice that PPBUS_G3H was low and so I replaced U7000 = ISL95530HIZ-TR5664 for an U7100 = ISL95530HIZ-TR5655 (not sure if compatible but I got none ISL95530HIZ-TR5664). For a while I geted the 8.7V on PPBUS_G3H but after a while it failed, and now only get 4.9V from ampmeter, and already replaced CD3215 but with the same result (4.9V).\n\nCan you help?"
