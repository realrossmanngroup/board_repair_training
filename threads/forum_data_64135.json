After removing <CHIP>U9580</CHIP> short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is gone, and have 20V on ampmeter, and 0.27A, but still no power on.\n\n<SIGNAL>P2V5_SW2_TPS62180_SSD0</SIGNAL> (on L9581) has 0.001 on diode reading, but I don't  know if it is because I've removed <CHIP>U9580</CHIP>.\n\nCan you help?\n\nI don't have any other <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2141</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> board to replace <CHIP>U9580</CHIP>.\n\nCan I use other mac board model to get this <CHIP>U9580</CHIP>?\n\nTKS"
