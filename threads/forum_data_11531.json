Doesn't SMC control the fans and such?  I am by no means being a jerk just trying to understand why you would suggest a PRAM reset is all..\n\nAlso you are correct there is no voltage on <CAPACITOR>C9015</CAPACITOR> and pin 2 on LCD cable looks burned out which is also on the same line.. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_LCDVDD_SW_F</SIGNAL>\n\nThanks for your previous prompt response!"

Can you do a PRAM reset?[/QUOTE]\n\nSorry for so many responses I should have waited and gave my results after investigating.. So I checked everything on that line and everything is good so it lead me to the <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> and it is not getting any voltage on its enable pin so nets <SIGNAL>LCD_IG_EN</SIGNAL>.   This is created by <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> PCH correct? \n\nSo my questions are:\n\nFirst What does the <SIGNAL>PP3V2_LCDVDD_SW_F</SIGNAL> do exactly?  I'm guessing it has something to do with switching something on related to LCD?  I get a white picture so isn't the LCD getting a image? \nSecond What should I do at this point?"

[/QUOTE]\n\nIndeed you where correct I did not have the LCD plugged in... The device is booting and getting to the folder with the question mark however the fan is really running fast which is making me think something is overheating.. I tried to boot up a copy of iOS through a usb drive I have and it runs super slow... I don't have a copy of ASD for this particular model.  Would you suggest I grab that?  Or any other suggestions?"
