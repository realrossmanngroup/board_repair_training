Now i get a white screen and the fan turns on really high and I don't get the folder with question mark - Is this a PCH issue?\n\nMy charger gives me the green light and I am getting a white screen with no folder with question mark and the fan turns on super fast.  I can't get to a screen to be able to run ASD to check sensors...\n\nDoes this sound like a PCH issue?"}

I am by no means being a jerk just trying to understand why you would suggest a PRAM reset is all..\n\nAlso you are correct there is no voltage on C9015 and pin 2 on LCD cable looks burned out which is also on the same line.. PP3V3_LCDVDD_SW_F\n\nThanks for your previous prompt response!"}

Can you do a PRAM reset?[\/QUOTE]\n\nSorry for so many responses I should have waited and gave my results after investigating.. So I checked everything on that line and everything is good so it lead me to the U9000 and it is not getting any voltage on its enable pin so nets LCD_IG_EN.   This is created by u1800 PCH correct? \n\nSo my questions are:\n\nFirst What does the PP3V2_LCDVDD_SW_F do exactly?  I'm guessing it has something to do with switching something on related to LCD?  I get a white picture so isn't the LCD getting a image? \nSecond What should I do at this point?"}

The device is booting and getting to the folder with the question mark however the fan is really running fast which is making me think something is overheating.. I tried to boot up a copy of iOS through a usb drive I have and it runs super slow... I don't have a copy of ASD for this particular model.  Would you suggest I grab that?  Or any other suggestions?"}

Common fault is the trackpad sensor, is it connected? You should download the ASD torrent, google for it, it is all ASD and is 56GB or something."}
