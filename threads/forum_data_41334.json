        "820-3787": "What is 820-3787? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "5V_S5": "What is 5V_S5? 5V_S5 is an abbreviation for “PP5V_S5” which is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 state. .",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP."
