            "message": "Hi. When I started this board I had PP3v42 but with no green light and no PPBUS. PP3v42 was 3.42V and PPBUS was shorted to ground.ISL was getting hot so I removed it and replaced ISL. I checked PPBUS in diode and most of the short was almost gone (0.386) but still no PPBUS. I plugged in the battery and that caused new ISL to short. PPBus was .012 in diode at this point. Removed new ISL and was back to 0.386 in diode on PPBUS. Plugged in battery with ISL removed and got PPBUS. Then I plugged in the charger as well and got green light for like 10 seconds but no fan spin. Then it turned off. Now things are worse than when I started. I have no PPBUS and no PP3v42. Voltage on F6905 is .475 now with new DCIN board. So Im not getting any power whatsoever. Not sure where to go from here. Thanks in advance. Have a good one.\n\n\nUpdate: PPDCIN shorted to ground as well.\n\nUpdate: Short was on <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> & <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>. Now I have voltage back. PP3v42 is back with a green light. Replaced ISL and now I have PPBUS @ 12.6V. But still no fan spin."

VIAs around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> are pretty discolored now. PPBUS is missing again. Diode mode is O.L. on PPBUS now. And just when everything was starting to look up. LOL.

Might want to replace <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> if you can't find out why\nPin 13 is connected to ground through a 0 ohm resistor so its to be expected\nPin 16 (<SIGNAL>VCCSAS0_LL</SIGNAL>) is <SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0</SIGNAL> before it goes through a coil and a resistor, so that has low resistance to ground. Its not supposed to be a direct short though. So that could mean you killed the CPU or dead <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, but post resistance in ohm first.\n\nWhat is the resistance to ground in ohm for pin 10 and 16?\n\nI would not say you're fucked, but after reading this topic I wouldn't be surprised its going to be a pain to fix"
