            "message": "Hi,\n\nI received this MacBook with a not turning on issue.\nThey said it wasn't liquid damaged just one day stopped working.\nI'm sure it wasn't dropped, because the MacBook looks pristine.\n\nHowever I'm not sure if it wasn't liquid damaged. There aren't discolored pads on the board.\nHowever around the components I can see some \"wet\" spots. No corrosion or anything. Just like it was immediately cleaned after a liquid damage.\nI'm not sure if it makes any sense. :)\n\nThere is a short on this board. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> shorted to ground. I can't find the shorted component(s) if there is any.\nI sent through 5A this board, but the voltage drop is really big. If it would be a shorted cap or any components I think that component should glow for now.\n0.6V at 5A, but I've 0.45V voltage drop through the cables. Which are speaker cables(the thicker one). I've lipo battery here, but I can't control the voltage and I just don't want to set the board on fire.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nThank you."
