SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this lineâ€™s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",

I can't be sure, but I believe PPBUS was at 12.6V because the board was working fine but not recognizing the battery at all. Not sure what might have changed."

Those both have measured fine from the beginning but the voltage was 1.8V on SCL until I ran a little flux underneath the SMC and heated up the area around the SCL ball. I removed the edge bonding before doing that and was careful with the heat. That restored the 3.4V on SCL but then PPBUS dropped down to 12.26V and the computer slowed down. <SIGNAL>CHGR_RST_L</SIGNAL> is at 3.4V."

We'll see where it ends up after final testing, but so far so good. I've never recovered correct data line voltage by reflowing the top of the SMC but I'l be trying it more often now."
