        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",
        "U7201": "What is U7201? U7201 is responsible for the 3.3v and 5v power rails on many devices..",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",

Except for a lot of smokey black dust the board looks fine. I checked power rails and <SIGNAL>PP5_S3</SIGNAL> is missing. After i disconnected the charger it is shortet (0.02V in diode mode) but it is slowly recovering as long as the board is off. It comes back to 0.4V. If i plug the charger back in and disconnect it again it is shorted again. I injected voltage and <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> was getting hot. I replaced it twice but still the same. Also the same happens to <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. Now i am stuck here..."

So as the \"temporary short\" is ok and not the problem here i kept searching and - what else could it be - the <SIGNAL>5V_S3</SIGNAL> enable and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> are missing... Are there areas on this board (like <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> on the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) that i could check?"
