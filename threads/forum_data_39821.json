This one powers on (no charger noise), no chime (normal), no video/backlight, and fan ramps up to full speed gradually. Inspected board completed, no liquid anywhere. Tried a new BIOS to be sure, and same behavior.\n\nI'll start going over the lower rails tomorrow, but wanted to get this posted in case there are any common things to check on this model. All help and direction appreciated--thanks as always!"
