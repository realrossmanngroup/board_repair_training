            "message": "No I was not joking. I searched for SMC Bypass for over three hours only finding chatter explaining suggesting doing a bypass, but nothing on how to actually do it. I found this by accident while searching another problem I'm having with a MBA that has a battery issue. [URL=\"https://www.tech-g.com/2015/04/15/macbook-pro-and-the-battery-problem/\"]https://www.tech-g.com/2015/04/15/ma...ttery-problem/[/URL]\n\nHow to do an SMC Bypass\n\nTo bypass the SMS and make the computer run, you do the following\n\n1- Disconnect the power cable.\n\n2- Hold down the power button for 10 seconds (or more), then while still holding the power button down, connect the power cable and keep the power button pressed down for another 10 seconds (or more), then once the 20 seconds are over (10 without cable and 10 with cable), release the button and press it again like you normally would to start the computer.\n\nMaybe this could save someone else a bit of time\n\nP.S. it only worked for me with the battery disconnected"

            "message": "Yeah, why should you need to hold the button 10s, if power is already disconnected?\nJust press the button, connect charger and keep pressing 5-10s.\nUsually starts in 5s, keep pressed untill 10s, just in case.\nOnce started, release the button.\nYou can use the power pads from MLB, instead of power button, when the MLB is on the desk alone.\n\nSo the MLB works in SMC bypass now?\nDo you get <SIGNAL>AVREF_SMC</SIGNAL>?"
