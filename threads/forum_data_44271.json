I know the process on EFI removal on older Mac's like 2014 MacBook Air, however, I do not know which CHIP holds the info on this Logic Board. If someone would be kind enough to point to the CHIP that does hold the EFI info and what it's identifier is, would be very much appreciated. \n\nOr maybe give me a clue to what the best way to remove the lock it. I have a TL866CS I use to program with. I usually solder each pin by hand. This Logic Board is different to me because the CHIP I think it is looks to be a BGA EFI CHIP (different style then what I am use to)\n\nAlso can someone point me to replacement CHIPS I can purchase for back up purposes?\n\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR ALL!!!!!"}
