Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

I have this board <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> which gets 20v powers on fan spins fast and no image no backlight. All diode mode measurements on all Coils are fine and also getting all necessary voltages just not getting backlight and CPU voltages. No liquid spill or corrosion anywhere the board looks like new. Any ideas would be appreciated \n\nThanks"
