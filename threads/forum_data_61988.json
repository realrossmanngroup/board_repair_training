I have this board A1708 820-00840 which gets 20v powers on fan spins fast and no image no backlight. All diode mode measurements on all Coils are fine and also getting all necessary voltages just not getting backlight and CPU voltages. No liquid spill or corrosion anywhere the board looks like new. Any ideas would be appreciated \n\nThanks"}
