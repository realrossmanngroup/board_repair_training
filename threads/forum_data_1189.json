            "message": "The logic behind this appears sound,  but really only works for phones that have no other existing issues after intial water damage. \n\nBasically, a really expensive vacuum dehydrator. However,  what they dont mention is that it does nothing for any remnants left behind  after the water content is dehydrated out; Salts,  minerals,  etc. \n\nI guess if you lived in a really large city it may be worth it,  but would be a disservice to your customer if the risk of not properly removing all trace elements left behind that a standard full treatment would address. I certainly wouldnt warranty this type of repair. \n\nThis is also something you could do yourself for about 300â€”500 dollars in equipment and u could even create a control program for vacuum and heat with some fairly simple arduino commands. Not sure the benefit is worth the effort though."

However i damn sure wpuldnt pay 15k for it. \n\nBasically its a money grab for servicing dumbasses. \n\nFunny side-note:\nSeller responded to a youtube question regarding the left behind deposits. The sellers response hilariously suggested rinsing deposits with tap water and then drying. Doesnt even mention opening the board,  so maybe you should just dunk it in more !Tap! water."
