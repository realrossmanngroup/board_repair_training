            "message": "Hi, first time posting here so bear with any details that are lacking. Trying my best to resolve issues with this board but going absolutely nowhere.\n\nNot much history to go by with this board, apart from seeing minor liquid damage across J1800, not much there nor any of it bridging across the pins. So cleaned this up.\nThe device wouldn't boot up whatsoever when I first got it, attempted SMC/PRAM reset but made no difference. Found a very small bit of liquid on <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> which was replaced. After that it actually booted with a mouse connected and lit up.\n\nGave it back to the customer yesterday and the issue happened again, no life. So looking at it all day today, there's 1.79V on CPU VCore, but the cpu doesn't get hot at all. Checked all state rails and of course were all on fine, just nothing else, no display or backlight, no USB mouse light activity. Powering it currently with a bench PSU and every so often when turning off then back on the psu, it will sometimes actually get past post and start to boot, sometimes all the way into the OS and will stay fine, other times it'll fluctuate between pulling 0.8A down to 0.02a. Right now it's got full fan spin and pulling 0.05a with no display, and cold cpu. These CPU temp measurements are with heatsink off by the way.\n\nAll memory power rails are turning on fine just checked that in case. Just so confusing to how this board sometimes powers up (one in every 6 or so attempts).\n\nAny idea on what this may be? Haven't really seen anything on the forum that describes a similar issue to what I've got. Been thinking of trying a different spi rom just to see if that fixes anything, I'm just doubting it because it does sometimes boot.\n\nThank you!\n\n\nEdit: I have tried SMC bypass before that is requested to try. Still has the same issue."

            "message": "Would have tried reballing the SMC, but the stencil I have ordered hasn't arrived yet.\n\nSo a little update is that I removed the spi rom chip from the board and replaced it with another boards one, and it seems to always power on now but it takes double the time for backlight to appear and once it attempts to boot it slows down around 3/4 the way and then hangs at the end of the progress bar - Going to assume this is clean ME issues, and had attempted to clean it (never done it before). I don't have medusa so using the clip method, so I removed the chip from the board and reprogrammed it but still same issue.. Will try again tomorrow with a full rewrite of the chip, but might just try read from the original chip and write to the new chip."
