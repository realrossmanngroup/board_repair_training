            "message": "I got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01958</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> after liqiud spill. Motherboard was not affected at all, no spots or corrosion, only audio board had some corrosion. Anyway board was completely dead. I have found out, that <SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> is shorted in <CHIP>U6400</CHIP>. I have replaced that chip and short is gone. Board switches to 20V, takes ~0,07A and... that's it. I have noticed, that there is no CPU VCORE and <SIGNAL>PP1V1_S3</SIGNAL> is not present too. Further measurements are below: \n\nResistance on <SIGNAL>PP1V1_S3</SIGNAL> is 4,6 ohm (0,003V in diode mode). I think it's far too low, no matter that the line is low voltage (I don't have the same working board but for comparison on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01521</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> resistance of line <SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3</SIGNAL> is 0,9k ohm and 0,220V in diode mode). Obviously I can't see anythyng warming up on thermal camera, as the line takes about 0,045A. \n\nother readings: \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12,62V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3,29V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> - 5,10V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> - 2,52V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> - 1,81V\n\nI can put the board to DFU mode, but can't revive or restore it. Could you please confirm if <SIGNAL>PP1V1_S3</SIGNAL> resistance is too low or normal?"
