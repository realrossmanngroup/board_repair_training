            "message": "Hello,\nthis <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> turns on normally and has a green light but after a few seconds it turns off again. The time it needs to turn off is never the same and sometimes it even stays on long enought to activate Backlight. After it turned off it automatically turns back on. I could be wrong here but i think that if i take the board out the housing it stays on longer because the fan spins up until is gets really loud. But outside the case it shuts off as well. Could it be some issue with the ram? It has no waterdamage or other visible damage and i donÂ´t really know where to start with this.\nThanks for any help"
