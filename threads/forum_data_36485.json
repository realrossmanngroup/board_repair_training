I have just re-applied some solder on each side of it.\n- <TRANSISTOR>Q7321</TRANSISTOR> wasn't replaced too as only the ground side had signs of liquid. I did re-applied some solder to it.\n\nSymptoms:\n\n Mac will load OSX with the progression bar and freeze/halt when reaching the end.\n\nTrying ASD OS will fail the ME region kext loading\nTrying the ASD EFI will fail with the IPBR sensor reading above limit and the Management Engine Present Test failing.\n\nAfter using the ASD EFI, I did measure <RESISTOR>R5429</RESISTOR> which measures fine and compared each side in diode mode with a known good board. Same values.\nI also did reflow the SMC.\nFinally I did backup the Bios 3 times and rewrote it with one with a Clear ME found on Vinafix. Same errors in ASD EFI.\n\nWhat could be causing the Management Engine Present Test to fail other than a faulty Bios.\n\nCan both problems leads to a faulty SMC?"

It needs the battery as well.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 4V if only charger is plugged whereas it is 10V when battery is plugged.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> has .115V drop to ground which seems like a decent value.\nI already replaced the ISL but same issue so I need to investigate this PPBUS issue first."
