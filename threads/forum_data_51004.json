All i'm getting is 5V on PP20V_USBC and the below measurements. \n\nPPBUS_G3H - 0.090\nPPBUS_HS_CPU - 0.090\nPPBUS_HS_OTH5V - 0.090\n\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.4 but pulses down to about 0.2v then back up to 3.4. same wit PP3V3_G3H_SMC.\n\nAny suggestions on where next to check. I'm still getting familiar with the 2016 up boards."
