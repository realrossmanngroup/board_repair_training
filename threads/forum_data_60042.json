Damage to camera connector cleaned up so I suspect the I\/O socket to blame, but no visible corrosion. Like none at all. :(  Even removed brass cover.\n\nI hate replacing the damn I\/O sockets.  \n\nSMC_LID goes to high when flex disconnected, then to 1.34 when it's connected.  Pullup is good.\nSYS_ONEWIRE stays at 1.4ish."}

I think I'll be able to get the rest.\n\nI just hate doing these connectors.  I usually remove the camera connector just to give myself more room and end up melting some plastic by being impatient, then have to fix misaligned pins ugh\n\ngo figure, 3.42 comes into the connector directly next to where the corrosion was!"}

I knew I had to, I think I just needed a push, thanks 2 and piernov.  I only melted the fan connector flap a bit!  Another layer of kapton tape might have helped that."}
