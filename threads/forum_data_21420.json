Never gets a chance to load the OS.\n\nI ran an air line over the heatsink just to keep it cool enough to get it to complete an ASD test with the battery attached.\n\nits failing on IPBR - Charger - BMON test\nSensor above the high limit.\n\nI've looked around the battery connector area but everything seems to test fine."

It will ramp up during a fan test though. \nIf I start it with the battery unplugged, its fine and then if I plug it in while its on, the heat on the CPU shoots up within 5-7 seconds."
