I've tested for short in diode mode (red on ground)\n\nPPBUS3V42_G3H @ L7095 pin2 =0.309\n\nPPBUS_G3H @ r7006 pin1 = 1.38\n\nVoltage for these two rails are as follows\n\nPPBUS3V42_G3H @ R7005 (BOTH PINS) = 16.5\n\nPPBUS_G3H @ R7006 (BOTH PINS) = 8.56\n\nThe Air boots really slow but once booted acts somewhat normal. Maybe just a tad slow but I haven't fixed the or diagnosed the OS yet.\n\nI've reset the SMC and visual inspection of board and caps looks good.\n\nJust looking for direction if there is no green light then what makes the green light?  I know it was the one wire circuit before but that is now in the SMC or?  \nSo could PP5V_S4RS3 make the green light."

But it will run off the battery so I'm stumped."
