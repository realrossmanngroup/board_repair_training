Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution.

This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",

First.. welcome to me at this forum.\n\nThis mac came with corrosion on <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR> <CHIP>U7230</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7291</TRANSISTOR>. no corrosion on audio board. i clean it all and doesnt seem to had problems or shorts.. i had on the usb-meter.. from 5v to 20v after 5 seconds. but doesnt starts... in some ports in a certain position.. after 20 secs i had a kind of reset or down...  (checked with power-z). the amps remains between 0.06  and 0.07 with 0.2 peaks sometimes (i send graphs from powerZ)\n\nThe two things i noted was..\na) In <TRANSISTOR>Q7065</TRANSISTOR> in <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_R</SIGNAL> i have 12.6v.. and the gates go from 12.6 to 4 or something volts... every 5 seconds.. it means.. five seconds 12v.. fiveseconds goes down.. five seconds goes high.. and so..\n\nb) <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> (from <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> CD3215A10) gets high temp..  But not guilty (even with a short between pin 2 and 3).. just a high current flow inside the dual mosfet i think... I retire <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> and have (red probe to gnd) 0.141 in diode mode on pin 5 (line <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS_F</SIGNAL> who goes to Fuse) and 0.566 on pin 8 who goes to <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>.. Pins 4 and 1 had 0.5 too.\n\nFinally, to comment, the graphics from power z.. graphics 1 its for one port conected in one form .. graph 2 its next port conected same way.. graph 3 its for the first port but. i moved up to down the power conector.. and graph 4 its for the second port with power plugged 180° too. i mean.. graph 1 and 3 its for same conector but spinned 180°.. and grap 2 and 4 are the other connector powered in one way and spinned.\n\nThanks in advance. and sorry for my english.. im mexican..\n\nMaybe the form of the current is not important but.. there it is..\n\nEDIT:\nI soldered back the mosfet and take some diode values\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 0.401\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> = 0.414\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> = 0.438\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3S</SIGNAL> =  0.349\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> =  0.355\n\nI hope this helps."
