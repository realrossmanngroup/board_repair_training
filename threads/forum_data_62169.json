First.. welcome to me at this forum.\n\nThis mac came with corrosion on Q7040 U7230 and Q7291. no corrosion on audio board. i clean it all and doesnt seem to had problems or shorts.. i had on the usb-meter.. from 5v to 20v after 5 seconds. but doesnt starts... in some ports in a certain position.. after 20 secs i had a kind of reset or down...  (checked with power-z). the amps remains between 0.06  and 0.07 with 0.2 peaks sometimes (i send graphs from powerZ)\n\nThe two things i noted was..\na) In Q7065 in PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_R i have 12.6v.. and the gates go from 12.6 to 4 or something volts... every 5 seconds.. it means.. five seconds 12v.. fiveseconds goes down.. five seconds goes high.. and so..\n\nb) Q3100 (from u3100 CD3215A10) gets high temp..  But not guilty (even with a short between pin 2 and 3).. just a high current flow inside the dual mosfet i think... I retire Q3100 and have (red probe to gnd) 0.141 in diode mode on pin 5 (line PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS_F who goes to Fuse) and 0.566 on pin 8 who goes to PPDCIN_G3H.. Pins 4 and 1 had 0.5 too.\n\nFinally, to comment, the graphics from power z.. graphics 1 its for one port conected in one form .. graph 2 its next port conected same way.. graph 3 its for the first port but. i moved up to down the power conector.. and graph 4 its for the second port with power plugged 180\u00b0 too. i mean.. graph 1 and 3 its for same conector but spinned 180\u00b0.. and grap 2 and 4 are the other connector powered in one way and spinned.\n\nThanks in advance. and sorry for my english.. im mexican..\n\nMaybe the form of the current is not important but.. there it is..\n\nEDIT:\nI soldered back the mosfet and take some diode values\nPPBUS_G3H = 0.401\nPP3V3_G3H = 0.414\nPP5V_G3S = 0.438\nPP3V3_G3S =  0.349\nPP1V8_G3S =  0.355\n\nI hope this helps."}
