The touch ID itself works, but can get it to power on with the power button. It powers on if i connect the charger to it with the battery unplugged. Original issue was liquid spill but can't find any corrosion damage.\nI swapped out the headphone jack/power connection board, which didn't fix the issue.\nThe laptop powers up and runs without any issue.\nI've not been able to find a board view for this model, i'm assuming there's none.\n\nCompared to <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> J4810 pin 15, i'm get 2.2v instead of 3.3v.\n\nAny suggestions. Will <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> touch ID/Power button work on this model (i know this will mean the touch ID portion won't work), as i'm about to order that to test the power button? The only other option is to order one from china."
