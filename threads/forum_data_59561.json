If <TRANSISTOR>Q3841</TRANSISTOR> isn't producing 1.05V then that rail won't be created?\n\n3V3S5 as measured at <SIGNAL>3V3S5_ENTRIP</SIGNAL> test point on <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is 0.751V.  If I'm understanding the architecture correctly, that should be coming from <TRANSISTOR>Q7800</TRANSISTOR> which in turn comes from the SMC, <CHIP>U4900</CHIP>.  At test point <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> which comes from pin 119 on <CHIP>U4900</CHIP> and goes to pin 1 on <TRANSISTOR>Q7800</TRANSISTOR>, I read 3.416V.  Interestingly(?), trying to read <SIGNAL>PM_G2_P3V3S5_EN_L</SIGNAL> coming from pin 3 on <TRANSISTOR>Q7800</TRANSISTOR> from its test point on the other side of the board, it is 0.00V.  And that's where I fall down: Knowing whether the voltage should make it through <TRANSISTOR>Q7800</TRANSISTOR> and on to pin 5 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR> and whether or where the <SIGNAL>1V05_S5</SIGNAL> rail is actually created or should be present.\n\nLooking at the schematics around <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, I am getting 4.952V on <SIGNAL>5V3V3S5_REG5</SIGNAL> from <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> and 3.388V on <SIGNAL>5V3V3_REG_EN</SIGNAL> (pin 13) on <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>.\n\nYour response caused me to relook at the schematics and rethink the flow of where rails are coming from, which is definitely some of what I was looking for.  Hopefully I can gain a better understanding of the architecture involved as we work through this.\n\nSteve"

You mentioned that exact voltages matter, and this one seemed to slightly but noticeably move between 1.053 and 1.056V.  Both sides of L7770 report the same voltage.\n\nFor what it's worth, 3.419V at L6995.  Your note on this and the resistance measurement prompted me to re-measure resistance to ground using L6995 - much bigger pad.  The multimeter took a while but did climb above 30K, so I probably did measure that incorrectly yesterday.\n\nThe 2.00V on pin 3 of <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> caught me off-guard.  Guessing that VREF means \"voltage reference\" but I can't find a reference to 2V being used as a reference voltage in the schematic.  Is <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> just creating that VREF for its own use, like a feedback?  Ties to pin 14, through <CAPACITOR>C7271</CAPACITOR>, and then onward to ?    In any event, I checked L7220 and am receiving 3.329V on pin 1, jumping around between 3.315V and 3.329V.\n\nSteve"
