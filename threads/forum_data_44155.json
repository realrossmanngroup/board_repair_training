            "message": "This little MacBook come in with no power - no charge issue. Upon plugging into my 61w original apple charger it started charging It now charges. When you turn it on it chimes boot logo and even goes into OS. After some time it shuts down unexpectantly. it usually lasts from 5 seconds to about a minute with no warning.\n\nIs this a software issue? What is the best way of diagnosing such a machine?\nAlso, I would like to point out that charge port and flex has also been changed and the board has been tested in another chassis to eliminate other hardware possibilities.\n\nHave you guys seen anything like this before?"
