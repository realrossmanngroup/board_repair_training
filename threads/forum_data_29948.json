            "message": "Macbook runs off of battery but only when battery is connected the green light turns off but computer functions as normal.\n\ni get a voltage drop of .779 on pin 1 and .782 on pin 2 of <DIODE>D6950</DIODE> a good board shows i should be getting 1.246 on both those pins. I cannot find the issue.\n\nupdate: after further fidling with the issue i found that the area around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <CHIP>U9410</CHIP> was getting really hot. As i was touching the area i made contact with <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <CHIP>U9410</CHIP> the board shut off and will no longer give me a green light. I then connected my power supply to find a short and the the area in between l7030, <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> were smoking up a lot i noticed <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> was heating up the most so removed it. After my power supply would show its normal voltage and power up the board as well show a green light while charger is connected. Problem is i cannot get it to start without the power supply throwing 18 volts at the dcin fuse. Board will not power on with charger alone.. any tips?\n\nupdate 2: board poweres on normal after unsoldering my power supply cables lol but im back where i started no charge. I removed the components which i could see emmit smoke l7030,<TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> and i got a small voltage drop increase on <DIODE>D6950</DIODE> pins 1 and 2 from 779/782 to 795. Any tips??"
