It is the sole reason customer has brought me it.\nI tried booting with the webcam removed - no difference sadly.\nLCD sensor reports 129c when screen disconnected and 25c when connected so no suspicion there.\n\nQUESTION: Is there a way to see the throttling back of the CPU other than the resulting slowness - a good utility perhaps?\n\nQUESTION: Also, given I've got a few sensors supposedly showing open circuit or high C values is there a certain chip that handles multiple sensor levels that might have failed?\n\nQUESTION: Do you think it could be found without aid of schematic and board view?"
