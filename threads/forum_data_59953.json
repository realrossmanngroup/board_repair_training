        "message":"Need some help on this one.\nThis one had extensive liquid damage around the usual CD3215 and U7650 area, but also around U7100 and U7800.\nInitially, the USBC chips weren't good so swapped one of them from one from a donor, this made it ask for 20V again.\nI've replaced U7800 because it was shorting PP3V3_LDO3V to ground (and the chip was getting hot). Have replaced it with one from exact same donor board, and short is gone.\n\nI tried seeing in what state the board is now, but i'm not getting in S5. My 5v_S5 is measuring 1.8V. Anyone know how this is possible? There is no short there."
