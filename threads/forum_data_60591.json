SO what your saying is even though the short is gone right now, when I solder on a known GOOD CPU, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> will have a short there again? \n\nIF SO, then I will not even attempt to power the Board on at all/inject any kind of voltage after soldering on a known GOOD CPU. Before any power is applied I will confirm if the short is present or not. That way IF the short is back the GOOD CPU should not get damaged AT ALL since no power was applied assuming the soldering is perfect. If it's gone I will attempt to power the Board normally. I have already replaced a few of these touch bar processors with success so I have the soldering method perfected. \n\nI have a great feeling that when I solder a known GOOD CPU back on the short will be back.\n\n[B]2informaticos[/B],[B] [/B]Could you please take the time and tell me how I would trace down the BAD power supply chip with the CPU off and the short appearing gone?\nOr if I need to solder on a known GOOD CPU first to trace down the original issue, if that is the case, how would I approach this knowing a GOOD CPU is soldered on? Would you blame a PCB issue at that point and force me to give up?"
