Replaced all corroded components, including U8400. Now the backlight works but only when I select a very low brightness setting. It disappears when the brightness setting is raised. PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is at a constant 49V. I assume there is some issue with the pulse-width modulation?"}

There was some invisible corrosion on the via for the powers supply to U8400 (PP5V_S0_BKLT_D). It was only delivering 4V instead of 5.1V. Bridged with a jumper wire and backlight is back in full strength."}
