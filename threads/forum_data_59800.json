        "message":"so to cut a long story short got an 820-00165 in today from a Macbook Air A1466. Was initally giving no green light on the charger which I traced back to a short on PP3V42_G3H after injecting power onto PP3V42_G3H it wasn't taking much power for anything to get hot. I pulled off U7090 - short was still there so put it back again. Finally traced it down to an SMC problem pulled the SMC off and the short was gone - have also checked and was getting 3.5v on PP3v42_G3H so looks ok now. Replaced the SMC from another 820-00165 and now i'm getting the green light which turns to orange but the macbook will not start still. PP_BUS is sitting at 8.58v as I would expect if the SMC is working but it's not powering up.\nIt also will not start in SMC_Bypass mode PM_SLP_SUS_L is low, PP3V3_SUS is present.\n\nShould also add that VCORE Is reading 11-12ohms to ground on L7310 - is that normal on this model or do I have a case of SMC died and killed CPU with it?\n\nWhere do I go from here with this board?"
