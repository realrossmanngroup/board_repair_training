        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",
        "SMC_BYPASS": "What is SMC_BYPASS? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP_BUS": "What is PP_BUS? This is a typo of PPBUS_G3H When you see PP_BUS, assume they meant to type PPBUS_G3H.",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PM_DSW_PWRGD": "What is PM_DSW_PWRGD? The \"PM_DSW_PWRGD\" signal in a MacBook stands for \"Deep Sleep Well Power Good‚Äù and is required for the machine to power on & post..",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. ."

Was initally giving no green light on the charger which I traced back to a short on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> after injecting power onto <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> it wasn't taking much power for anything to get hot. I pulled off <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> - short was still there so put it back again. Finally traced it down to an SMC problem pulled the SMC off and the short was gone - have also checked and was getting 3.5v on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> so looks ok now. Replaced the SMC from another <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and now i'm getting the green light which turns to orange but the macbook will not start still. <SIGNAL>PP_BUS</SIGNAL> is sitting at 8.58v as I would expect if the SMC is working but it's not powering up.\nIt also will not start in <SIGNAL>SMC_BYPASS</SIGNAL> mode <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> is low, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> is present.\n\nShould also add that VCORE Is reading 11-12ohms to ground on L7310 - is that normal on this model or do I have a case of SMC died and killed CPU with it?\n\nWhere do I go from here with this board?"
