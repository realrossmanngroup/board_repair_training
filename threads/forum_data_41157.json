        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN": "What is SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "ALL_SYS": "What is ALL_SYS? This is a typo of ALL_SYS_PWRGD When you see ALL_SYS, assume they meant to type ALL_SYS_PWRGD.",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on.."

Replaced <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> after cleaning up the pins a bit, but the damage was very slight. No liquid anywhere else on the board at all. After replacing, same exact issues. <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> pulses every few seconds; found no shorts across all major rails, but did find <SIGNAL>SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN</SIGNAL> missing and not pulsing. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> present and not pulsing either. Replaced SMC, clock and <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> again to be sure, and no change; same exact symptoms. S5 rails and SUS rails present and NOT pulsing, but everything after is pulsing, including <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL>. Since my <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is pulsing along with fan twitch, I'd imagine wherever the interruption is, is the only (hopefully) issue. Not finding any shorts was disappointing, but hopefully identifying <SIGNAL>SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN</SIGNAL> missing will help narrow some things down. Have seen this same damage to <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> sooo many times, but usually it's easily resolved. Hoping this one didn't damage the CPU, but have hopes since <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS</SIGNAL> is pulsing.\n\nI'm a bit lost on where to go from here, any help appreciated!"
