        "message":"Hi guys,\n\nwe're working on a 820-2936-B logic board that came in it has green light on the charger with quarter fan spin. Replaced U7400, ISL 6259, U2800, U7200, PP3v3_S0 has no shorts to ground and everything checks out okay. i replaced Q7830, R7830, R7832, C7830, C7831,i jumped Q7812 pin 3 and 4 to ground and received the same results. I am a bit confused on understanding on how this circuit works. when i removed Q7830 the fan spins and the board does not turn on, but i know it needs PP3V3_S0 to power most of the board. Any help would be highly appreciated. Really confused.[IMG]http:\/\/advancedreworks.com\/forum\/images\/smilies\/duh.gif[\/IMG][IMG]http:\/\/advancedreworks.com\/forum\/images\/smilies\/duh.gif[\/IMG]"
