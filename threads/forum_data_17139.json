            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nwe're working on a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B logic board that came in it has green light on the charger with quarter fan spin. Replaced <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>, ISL 6259, <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> has no shorts to ground and everything checks out okay. i replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7830</TRANSISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7830</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7832</RESISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7830</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7831</CAPACITOR>,i jumped <TRANSISTOR>Q7812</TRANSISTOR> pin 3 and 4 to ground and received the same results. I am a bit confused on understanding on how this circuit works. when i removed <TRANSISTOR>Q7830</TRANSISTOR> the fan spins and the board does not turn on, but i know it needs <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> to power most of the board. Any help would be highly appreciated. Really confused.[IMG]http://advancedreworks.com/forum/images/smilies/duh.gif[/IMG][IMG]http://advancedreworks.com/forum/images/smilies/duh.gif[/IMG]"
