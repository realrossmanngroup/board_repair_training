I checked various memory modules on both slots and verified that PP1V5_S3_MEM_A and PP1V5_S3_MEM_B are present at 1.5V (C3110 and C3210) after power on.\n\nWhat could be causing this?\n\nbr,\ngeorge"

I also removed the flex from J3500 to no avail.\n\nafter 4-5 tries it stopped beeping and R5201\/02 (SMBUS_MCP_0_DATA) reads 1,1V momentarily - same time the fans seems to pause for a few mseconds - like a restart (it doesn't chime so cant tell for sure).\n\ncouple of tries later the beeping is back.\n\nfucker."
