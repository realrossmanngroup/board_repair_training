It keeps beeping once every sec or so... I checked various memory modules on both slots and verified that <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3_MEM_A</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3_MEM_B</SIGNAL> are present at 1.5V (<CAPACITOR>C3110</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C3210</CAPACITOR>) after power on.\n\nWhat could be causing this?\n\nbr,\ngeorge"

I also removed the flex from J3500 to no avail.\n\nafter 4-5 tries it stopped beeping and <RESISTOR>R5201</RESISTOR>/02 (<SIGNAL>SMBUS_MCP_0_DATA</SIGNAL>) reads 1,1V momentarily - same time the fans seems to pause for a few mseconds - like a restart (it doesn't chime so cant tell for sure).\n\ncouple of tries later the beeping is back.\n\nfucker."
