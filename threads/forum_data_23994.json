        "message":"Hello!\nI got an 15\" 2011 Hi Res, 820-2915 which chimes and boots into OSX but there is no video, just a black screen. Also on external I get no video.\n\nWhat I did:\n\n-PRAM & SMC reset (successful)\n-tried another harddisc\n-checked LVDS connector, supplies are there but LCD_PWR_EN does not enable U9000\n\n-all power rails are there except:\n\nPPVCCSA_S0_REG\nonly 0,9V\nChecked U7100 (ISL95870A) and all components around, all ok. Regarding schematic, it should be 0,9V?! When VID0 and VID1 Voltage is 0, Output = 0.9V?!\n\n\nPPVCORE_S0_AXG\n0,9V but then falling down to 0,45V\n\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU\n1,15V but then falling down to 0,75V\n\nI have checked current sensing circuit after the big coils on PHASE1,2,3,AVG and connection to U7400 (MAX17511). All ok.\nThat complete \"PHASE\" circuitry is a bit complicated to understand for me.....\n\nAny ideas or hints how I should proceed or focus on??\n\nTHANKS"
