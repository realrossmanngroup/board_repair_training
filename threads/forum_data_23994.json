Also on external I get no video.\n\nWhat I did:\n\n-PRAM & SMC reset (successful)\n-tried another harddisc\n-checked LVDS connector, supplies are there but <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> does not enable <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>\n\n-all power rails are there except:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_REG</SIGNAL>\nonly 0,9V\nChecked <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> (ISL95870A) and all components around, all ok. Regarding schematic, it should be 0,9V?! When VID0 and VID1 Voltage is 0, Output = 0.9V?!\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL>\n0,9V but then falling down to 0,45V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>\n1,15V but then falling down to 0,75V\n\nI have checked current sensing circuit after the big coils on PHASE1,2,3,AVG and connection to <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> (MAX17511). All ok.\nThat complete \"PHASE\" circuitry is a bit complicated to understand for me.....\n\nAny ideas or hints how I should proceed or focus on??\n\nTHANKS"
