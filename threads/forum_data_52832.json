            "message": "OK, so I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that is taking 20 milliamps. I did a quick power on before I discovered a small amount of corrosion to the right of <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>. I checked the resistance of the 4 resistors, (8164, 7613, 7614 & 7610). all values check with the exception of <RESISTOR>R7613</RESISTOR> which measures 20K instead of 47.5K. I measured L7630 and found pin 1 to be shorted to ground. I'm assuming my options are: Replace <RESISTOR>R7613</RESISTOR> and check PPBUS after, Pull <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> and check for short again or toss this POS in the donor pile. Just looking for suggestions before I bin it. BTW no fan spin but have light on the charger."

Now check <SIGNAL>CHGR_UGATE</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>CHGR_LGATE</SIGNAL> voltages. <SIGNAL>CHGR_LGATE</SIGNAL> should be 0.00x mV at most...while <SIGNAL>CHGR_UGATE</SIGNAL> should be same as <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is expected to be. These are really pulsed DC averaged readings for the gates of the dual FET. Pull and read ohms to ground at pin 2 of F7140. Pump your OWN <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> voltage into pin 2 with your own power supply.and look for hot spot / gated short, spy the current draw / behavior. If you find that you need to replace your <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>: your stock of that chip is probably old. The contacts on the underside of the chip are not going to take to tinning well. Use an acidic flux on the contacts under the new <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>. Something like Rubyfluid. With small soldering pen and your own bismuth / tin low-melt no lead solder. I specify no-lead because lead wets flat, no - lead fills gaps nicely. Flow the chip into place, let it set. push tweezers onto top of chip when cold, reflow and squish out excess solder. Clean-up squished-out solder blobs with knife-edge tip with 220C air and fresh flux, wetting ends of all chip contacts to board pads nicely. That's a VERY picky and important chip!"
