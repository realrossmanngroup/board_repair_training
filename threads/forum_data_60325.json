I could use it for a day or so.\nThen again, same short, same dead IC.\n\nAfter replacing it again, board would work again.\nI did replace that chip 3 times already (and it's no fun cause it seats between CPU and GPU)\nSo my question is: what can cause that IC to die over and over again?\n\nCould it be the CPU draining to much amperage?"
