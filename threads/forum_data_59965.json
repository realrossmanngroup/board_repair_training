Does the cpu still cause this to happen. I though the last few that did this I had all of my ssd rail powers, but not this one.\n\nIs there a possible common thing that can cause no ssd rail powers? \n\nI would really like to see if I can save this one because it is rare I thought for one of these to have the i7 chip and 16gb or ram.\n\nFYI when connecting a usb with high sierra on it it works fine with no problems.\n\nThanks"
