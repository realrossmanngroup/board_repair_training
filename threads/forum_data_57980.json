    "definitions": {
        "820-00138A": "What is 820-00138A? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "R7185": "What is R7185? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7180": "What is R7180? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",
        "D7010": "What is D7010? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year retina model macbook pros, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "R7012": "What is R7012? a RESISTOR.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "PPDCIN_CHRGR": "What is PPDCIN_CHRGR? a SIGNAL.",

        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "C7125": "What is C7125? Capacitor between CHGR_BOOT and CHGR_PHASE important for bootstrapping creation of PPBUS_G3H on 2013-2015 macbook pros.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",

A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",
