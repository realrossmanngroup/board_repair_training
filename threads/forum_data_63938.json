This happens with every connector unplugged from the logic board, on battery or USB-C power. FMI is OFF. Holding the power button during startup proceeds to “Loading startup options”, then shuts down.\n\nDFU Restore proceeds to Apple logo on the target machine with progress bar, but gets stuck at about 75% of progress bar, then restarts into the usual boot loop. The Restore fails on the host machine with error 9 (The System cannot be restored on this device)."
