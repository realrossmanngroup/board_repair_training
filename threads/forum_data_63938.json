        "message":"This 820-02020 had some minor liquid damage in the areas of UR630 (speaker amp), UD540 and UD560 (PP3V3).\n\nIt is stuck in a boot loop: it chimes, then begins to show the progress bar to around 15-20%, then shuts down and chimes again. This happens with every connector unplugged from the logic board, on battery or USB-C power. FMI is OFF. Holding the power button during startup proceeds to \u201cLoading startup options\u201d, then shuts down.\n\nDFU Restore proceeds to Apple logo on the target machine with progress bar, but gets stuck at about 75% of progress bar, then restarts into the usual boot loop. The Restore fails on the host machine with error 9 (The System cannot be restored on this device)."
