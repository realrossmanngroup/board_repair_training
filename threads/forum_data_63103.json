Fixed water damage and it worked perfectly. Was putting back in top case and there was a bee in my room and I kinda maybe might have thrown the board at the bee :p and surprisingly everything still worked perfectly except the backlight. I bought a BY-3200 cable so I could test voltages and such outside of the top case and this was my first time using it. I plugged it in, checked a few rails, then was looking at the board view on my laptop when I heard a pop and saw the magic smoke. I have no idea where it came from. Nothing was warm and no components look damaged. It was in this general area though. And like I said it looks like hell lmao I was a lil bit drunk cuz it was pissing me off. It's a personal board, not a customer one. I'm not that unprofessional. I feel like I need to figure out what went poof before I figure out the backlight problem but honestly idk what to do as I don't see anything visible. But it came from the general area I was probing with the backlight components.\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60791[\/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60790[\/ATTACH]"}
