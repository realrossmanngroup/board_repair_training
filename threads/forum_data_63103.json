        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",

        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created..",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT is PPBUS_G3H backlight voltage entering the backlight boost circuit once the transistor has been told to allow it through. .",

        "LCDBKLT_FB": "What is LCDBKLT_FB? LCDBKLT_FB is a feedback line between backlight output and the feedback pin on the LED driver. When this connection is broken, backlight output will be equal to PPBUS_G3H voltage of the system rather than boosting. Since this point is the highest voltage in the system, it is the fastest to corrode when liquid damaged, so it is a very common point to check when there is no backlight. .",

Was putting back in top case and there was a bee in my room and I kinda maybe might have thrown the board at the bee :p and surprisingly everything still worked perfectly except the backlight. I bought a BY-3200 cable so I could test voltages and such outside of the top case and this was my first time using it. I plugged it in, checked a few rails, then was looking at the board view on my laptop when I heard a pop and saw the magic smoke. I have no idea where it came from. Nothing was warm and no components look damaged. It was in this general area though. And like I said it looks like hell lmao I was a lil bit drunk cuz it was pissing me off. It's a personal board, not a customer one. I'm not that unprofessional. I feel like I need to figure out what went poof before I figure out the backlight problem but honestly idk what to do as I don't see anything visible. But it came from the general area I was probing with the backlight components.\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60791[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60790[/ATTACH]"
