        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. ."

The weirdest part is that it doesnt show any light at the connector. At one point, this board was showing a strong greenlight. Any idea whats going on here? Is my charger bad?\n\nThanks\n\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 14.99v (18.5v)\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.40v (3.42v)\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 8.55v (8.6v)"
