It does this twice. In the third time it will boot normally. The weirdest part is that it doesnt show any light at the connector. At one point, this board was showing a strong greenlight. Any idea whats going on here? Is my charger bad?\n\nThanks\n\nPPDCIN_G3H 14.99v (18.5v)\nPP3V42_G3H 3.40v (3.42v)\nPPBUS_G3H 8.55v (8.6v)"}
