        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",

SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC is a voltage that is created if SMC_BC_ACOK & PP3V42_G3H are both present that powers the chipset for the onewire circuit that allows the SMC to talk to the charger on the SYS_ONEWIRE line.
