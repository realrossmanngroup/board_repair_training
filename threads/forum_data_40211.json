Didnt know it was a thing.\nIve hadd 2 apple rework boards both with a huge amount reserve\/Not connected pads nowhere to be seen.\n\nThe best one i saw was an apple rework (with edge bonding still intact) 820-3332 VRAM block that had about 30% missing pads, so they dug into the pcb and soldered vram to the via's.\n\nApples refurb boards are Awful! ill keep my eye out for the dot."}

There are still good chips out there, just people in the know dont talk about it.\nI dont care how or why he purchased the rework station.\n\n\nA big misconception is that fake\/reballed\/zombie chips dont work for more than a week or 2. Good process engineering and rework practice reduces risks, lowers returns and increases success rate, regardless of chipset quality. Yes fake chipsets will last 6\/12 months, and im not suggesting you go spend 100k on a rework station, but owning a top end station isnt a bad thing.\nId rather be replacing BGA's on a high end station than be replacing the same chipset on my somewhat unpredictable Chinese rework station."}
