        "message":"820-3437 with moisture damage. Light, no fan. Board worked on previously - SMC reworked. No history on this repair. Believe this damage came after previous repair. \n\nS0 Rail PGOOD - Q8150 area corrosion. Pad for pin 1 of R8156 burnt away. Removed and cleaned up. Plugged board in to watch for short.. surprised by fan cycling as usual then came on.\nReplaced R8156 and ran jumper to near PP3v3_S5 (tested at 3.34v). Back to no power. Removed jumper all works. Replaced Q8150, same results. \nQ8150 provides ALL_SYS_PWRGD but R8156 appears to be the only non S0 supply... Does this mean it\u2019s sensing an issue with PP3v3_S5 which I\u2019m bypassing or S0 somewhere else? Or Is this an issue after, with the SMC or two other inputs from ALL_SYS_PWRGD?\n\nChecked area for shorts compared to good board. \nKnown good I\/O board and cable. \nPower supply and good Magsafe. \n\nMachine boots, loads to recovery mode, charges battery and runs ASD all fine. Only issue found is with a CPU thermal sensor (related?). \n\nCan I run without R8156 even though it supplies to a \u2018critical\u2019 component?"
