            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with moisture damage. Light, no fan. Board worked on previously - SMC reworked. No history on this repair. Believe this damage came after previous repair. \n\nS0 Rail PGOOD - <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> area corrosion. Pad for pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R8156</RESISTOR> burnt away. Removed and cleaned up. Plugged board in to watch for short.. surprised by fan cycling as usual then came on.\nReplaced <RESISTOR>R8156</RESISTOR> and ran jumper to near <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> (tested at 3.34v). Back to no power. Removed jumper all works. Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR>, same results. \n<TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> provides <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> but <RESISTOR>R8156</RESISTOR> appears to be the only non S0 supply... Does this mean it’s sensing an issue with <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> which I’m bypassing or S0 somewhere else? Or Is this an issue after, with the SMC or two other inputs from <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>?\n\nChecked area for shorts compared to good board. \nKnown good I/O board and cable. \nPower supply and good Magsafe. \n\nMachine boots, loads to recovery mode, charges battery and runs ASD all fine. Only issue found is with a CPU thermal sensor (related?). \n\nCan I run without <RESISTOR>R8156</RESISTOR> even though it supplies to a ‘critical’ component?"
