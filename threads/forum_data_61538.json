        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>\n\nWill run off charger alone, no battery connected, will run off battery, however when plugged into charger while on battery, it will say \"Battery Is Not Charging\".\n\nI used my USB-C meter, and the board will take 20.38V and 0.000-0.020 mah while plugged into the charger, and having the battery plugged in.\n\nThere was some corrosion around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, however Ive replaced what needed to be replaced and still the same issue. Im struggling to find the cause because of my lack of understanding of why this is, and how the charging circuit works.\n\nThank you!"
