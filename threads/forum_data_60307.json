I'm still learning, as you can probably tell. :)\nAll good points you make.\nI posted all those different voltages in case you wanted them, to save time... but yes... that was a waste of time, lol.\n\nI'll find another C5002 equivalent from a dead board and replace it.\nNo signs of corrosion anywhere.\n\nAll the SPI Bus Series Termination resistors measure correct resistance.\n\nHowever, SPI_CLK and SPI_MOSI both show zero volts.\nThe two other SPI lines, SPI_MISO and SPI_CS both show 3.3 volts.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is R6102 should be 100K Ohms resistance, but shows as only 65.5-74 KOhms.\nHowever, I did test another, admittedly unknown faulty board, and the R6102 on that one was 74K\n\nI cleaned J6100, despite it looking pristine.\n\nPLT_RESET_L goes to 3.35 volts\n\nI'll have a look for the same board to get a BIOS chip off, but thought I'd post this data in the meantime."}
