            "message": "Hello , Im learning how to fix macbooks and i've been trying to work on one, but as i dont have much knowledge i got stuck. And i was wondering maybe you could guide me atleast where should i start from where i am now. \n\nI have this macbook which had hot chocolate spilled on. Let me explain what i have discovered and done so far. \n \n<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2141</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-1700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> 2019 16\" \n\nWhats wrong with it :\n\nRunning slow (Everything you do takes 10x then estimated time)\n\nHas <SIGNAL>KERNEL_TASK</SIGNAL> running 1000+% ( Picture 9 )\n\nWhen booting to safe mode or to recovery at 3/4 shows artifacts on screen then white screen and back to normal everytime ( Picture 6 ).\nSometimes when turning off shows ( Picture 8 ).\n\nHad weird ssd volume split ( Picture 4 ) not sure what caused that but could not delete weird volumes created like 15 of them same random small size ( Picture 7 ). Was giving errors when trying to delete volumes ( Picture 5 ). But managed to sort that  with forcing through terminal, now looks all ok.\n\n\nFrom visual inspection of the board i have found \nLiquid damaged place ( Picture 1 ).\nI have cleaned the mess and found that component <TRANSISTOR>Q5480</TRANSISTOR> pins 3 and 4 (Picture 2, 3, 10 ) were burned out \nAlso <RESISTOR>R5488</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5441</RESISTOR> had pads missing ( Picture 2, 3, 10). Brought back the pads and found mosfet  (<TRANSISTOR>Q5480</TRANSISTOR>) to buy so i replaced them. \n\nAs you can see in ( Picture 10 ) <RESISTOR>R5498</RESISTOR> <RESISTOR>R3003</RESISTOR> marked. They had each pad missing two which i have brought back too and replaced them. \n \nSo maybe you could help me from here cause im lost dont know which line to check is it ssd whats slow or cpu not getting right voltage. Or just vsense i dont know. Im just learning this so i tried my best explaining. \n\nWould be nice if you could help me. ?"
