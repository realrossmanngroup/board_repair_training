I'm suspicious about <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> being bad but that would be data gone, can something make <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> cycle ?\nCPU/GPU are getting hot and cold (cycle).\nDFU mode is impossible because the board is cycling.\nWhere should I start from there ?"

Do you have possibilities to use a Thermal camera?"
