Went over the board half a dozen times looking for anything that could cause this. I think we are looking at a non water related issue.\n\nI have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> LB that never sends the 3.3v enable signal to turn on power to the LCD The screen never comes on and never has back light as a result.\nAll the power rails appear functional and voltages on the CPU are normal.\n\nAfter looking at the board under thermal imaging I noticed that the RAM modules were never showing activity. What I normally observe is once CPU power is on and <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> fires up the BIOS program is loaded into ram and starts running. You can see the memory light up slightly as it comes to life. on this board it does not.\n\nI backed up and replaced the BIOS and this did not help.\n\nClock signals are present.\nI can watch the CPU read the BIOS on the scope.\nOn the memory modules MEM_( A or B) _CLK signals are both not present.\nMemory 1v2 and 1v8 s3 rails are present and working properly."

This is not normal behavior for a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board.This however similar to the normal current on power cycle just not the power down section.   Also during the 500-600mA cycle fin spin is full speed.   Did this before I flashed the bios."
