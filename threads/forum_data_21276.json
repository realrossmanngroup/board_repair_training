If i have battery it powers on if i have battery and charger it powers on. if i plug battery in then power on the system unplug the battery with the charger still plugged in it will continue to run on the charger.  and like i said before it will run the battery perfectly.   unfortunately it is not the charger.. i fixed 3 boards this morning with this charger and working on a 5th one right now and its been running it perfect without a battery installed.  so i know it is not the charger.  also tested with a second charger before and it was no different."
