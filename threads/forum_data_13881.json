Some one tried fix board . No voltage on PPBUS_G3H and replaced U7000 nothing changed.\nAfter removed F7040 [U]green light come back[\/U], then i inject 12.5V PPBUS_G3H line fan spin 3 sec. than stop loop .\n\nNote: When i connected battery green or orange light not come only battery disconnected green light turns on.\n\nNow where can i check next step?"}
