            "message": "I second phuketmymac. The 2015s have a cable that runs over the battery and between the case. This commonly fails due to the MacBook being held with 1 hand and also from small particles becoming stuck to the flex cable tape underneath and pressing into the cable. I see this about 1-2 times a week. \nThis model uses ForceTouch. 2013-2014 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>'s do not and are similar to previous models, with a lip and button. This could simply be dirt around the lip. Unfortunately, this is not very user serviceable, as the battery is glued in and would need to be removed to access the TP. \n\nEasiest way to tell if its a 2015 is when the machine is off, the trackpad will not click at all. (Of course if your mechanism is stuck, this doesnt help)."
