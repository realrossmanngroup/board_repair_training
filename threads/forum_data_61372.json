    "definitions": {
        "A1708": "What is A1708? A1708 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2017, 2016 with EMC 3164, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00840, 820-00875..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_SNS": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_SNS? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7210": "What is U7210? a CHIP."

            "message": "I got an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> that is not booting up after an screen repair. I'm a bit of beginner into this, but I want to learn. I started checking voltage with some of the known point and got these:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 0.4mv\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_SNS</SIGNAL> 19.88v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.40v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 0.1mv\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER_EN</SIGNAL> - 0V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 3.4V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> - 1.06V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> - 0V\n\nIt seems like <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is shorted. Not sure though. What does that mean and what should I do next ? Since I'm learning, it would be nice to have an explanation of what's going on if possible :D\n\nThanks !"
