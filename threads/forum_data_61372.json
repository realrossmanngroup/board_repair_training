I'm a bit of beginner into this, but I want to learn. I started checking voltage with some of the known point and got these:\n\nPPBUS_G3H 0.4mv\nPPDCIN_G3H_SNS 19.88v\nPP5V_S5 0v\nPP3V3_G3H 3.40v\nPP3V3_S5 0.1mv\n\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN - 0V\nSMC_RESET_L - 3.4V\nSMC_BC_ACOK - 1.06V\nPP3V3_s5 - 0V\n\nIt seems like ppbus_G3H is shorted. Not sure though. What does that mean and what should I do next ? Since I'm learning, it would be nice to have an explanation of what's going on if possible :D\n\nThanks !"}

All of them had a low value. I checked the big coils to ground and one of them didn't beep (L8410). I read the ''How to collection'' it helped understand.
