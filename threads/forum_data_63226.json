Flex and board replaced and boot but there is no audio.\nTested with three audio boards and flexes.\n\nThere is in setting output device.\nWhen press vol up/down I see it on screen.\nMic works fine.\nAudio works fine via hedphone jask socket.\n\nThere was short on <CAPACITOR>C6408</CAPACITOR> - replaced <CHIP>U6400</CHIP>, short is gone, issue with audio the same.\n\nJ6100 in diode mode looks good.\n\nTested with known good speakers as well - same issue.\n\nAny idea?"
