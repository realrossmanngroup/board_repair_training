First I took the board out cleaned the whole board. Changed the components on the corrosion parts. But now on my ampmeter when I plug it I get on 5.192V 0.00A from all Type-C ports.\n\nAnd I cant see any heating part under the thermal camera also.\n\nany idea where should I start to look? Watched too many videos and read posts but couldn't get any idea. And it is my first time working ona T2 chip macbook.\n\nThank you for your all help already.\n\nKind regards\n\nEmre"
