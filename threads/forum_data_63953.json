            "message": "Working on M1 Air with <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-02016</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board. Customer turned it off in the evening and in the morning couln'd turn it back on. Board has no signs of damages, corrosion or so. It doesn't switch to 20V, stuck at 5V and fluctuating between 0,038A to 0,13A. Trackpad doesn't click, can't get into DFU mode. Some power lines are pulsing (more info below).\n\nSome basic measurements: \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> - 12,3V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_AON</SIGNAL> - 1,79V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S2</SIGNAL> - 1,78V -> pulsing\n<SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL> - 3,8V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC_LDO</SIGNAL> - 3,3V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2</SIGNAL> - 3,3V -> pulsing\n\nI have measured lines around <CHIP>U8100</CHIP>/<CHIP>U7700</CHIP> comparing with another good board. Found out, that <SIGNAL>PP1V0_S2SW_DRAM</SIGNAL> has 13,6ohm resistance to ground (0,006V in diode mode) compared to 69ohm and 0,039V in diode mode on good board. I'm asuming, that the RAM is damaged. If I connect the power there is 1V present on this line, but it's pulsing. Can it be the problem anyway? Another question - can I replace RAM chips P&P from another board without programming or so? I have plenty of these board for parts."
