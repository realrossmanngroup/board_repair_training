            "message": "Hi guys\n\nI got a liquid spilled MacBook 12 inch retina newest model. The board is <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00244</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> but I cannot find schematics and board view for it anywhere online.\n\nIt is missing three components which were totally burned. It had a lot of \"pigeon poo\" looking stuff around the whole area marked with a red box in attached picture and after cleaning the three components marked with red circles were completely missing or burned beyond recognition.\n\nMy question is now - do anyone know the missing components and their readings?\n\nLink to full size pic: [URL]http://i65.tinypic.com/29xhzcz.jpg[/URL]\n\n[IMG]http://i65.tinypic.com/29xhzcz.jpg[/IMG]"
