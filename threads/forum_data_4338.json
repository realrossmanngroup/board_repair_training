I changed it. \nThe board still does not start. The fan does not spin up.\n\nI have:\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.56V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_SUS</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PCH_CLK32K</SIGNAL>\nRSMRST at 3.1V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> - comes on for a sec\nY5110 oscillates - for a sec. I changed the SMC I thought that's the problem. It wasn't. It does the exact same thing.\n\nWhen first I connect the adapter I can measure all the voltages for a sec.\nSo I have CPU VCORE. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> etc. I got something on every power rail for a sec, but the fan doesn't spin up at all.\nI have to reconnect the power adapter every time, if I want to measure those power rails.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThank you!"

Hard to tell. I changed Y1905 and <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> same thing. \n\nI've one more exact same board almost with the same problem, but that one tries to turn on-off (fan does not spin). I just can see on the CPU VCORE it jumps up and down for a sec."
