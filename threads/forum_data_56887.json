        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15‚Äù Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
