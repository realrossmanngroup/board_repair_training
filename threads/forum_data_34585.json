I must enter the password to the OS and i can continue. The computer does NOT restart or shut down with message GPU panic as is customary. Only freezes and logout. When i start Unigine Heaven with Intel GPU, everything is ok... so, the problem is with only NVIDIA GPU.\n\nI try replaced GPU for a new one and reballing GPU-RAM, replace <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>, but the problem is the same.\n\nCan you anybody help me? Some idea?\n\nThank you very much."
