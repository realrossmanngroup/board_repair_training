I cleaned everything, gave a nice reflow with lots of Amtech flux on <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> and still cannot get charger to negotiate 20V. Both ports give 5V stuck. <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> is responsible for RTC, but there are no shorts near it nor anywhere on the board. Where to start? I have very little experience with these new boards with USB-C charging, trying to understand it's architecture, but I'm not very smart LOL."
