Got an 820-01987 board here with liquid spill. Originally liquid was near U6903 and C10G1. I cleaned everything, gave a nice reflow with lots of Amtech flux on U6903 and still cannot get charger to negotiate 20V. Both ports give 5V stuck. U6903 is responsible for RTC, but there are no shorts near it nor anywhere on the board. Where to start? I have very little experience with these new boards with USB-C charging, trying to understand it's architecture, but I'm not very smart LOL."}
