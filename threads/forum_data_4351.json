        "message":"I have a water damaged 820-3437 that powers on, there is backlight for a sec then it turns off and also there is no green light. I have replaced LP8550 already and also ran a trace from ball 5 on LP7701 to pin 1 of C7796 because I thought I had a bad feedback trace. (Any suggestions on an easier way to measure for a bad trace besides continunity mode from eah side of the board would be great).  After that I still have backlight for only a sec and I am still getting 8.5V on backlight circuit.  Please help!!"

But if thats not the case then in more rare situations it could also be the trackpad (or ipd connector\/cable) or SMC or C4835.\n\nBut start by measuring SMC_LID to check if its high or low to see if it is because of this or not."
