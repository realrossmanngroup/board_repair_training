I have replaced <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> already and also ran a trace from ball 5 on <CHIP>LP7701</CHIP> to pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C7796</CAPACITOR> because I thought I had a bad feedback trace. (Any suggestions on an easier way to measure for a bad trace besides continunity mode from eah side of the board would be great).  After that I still have backlight for only a sec and I am still getting 8.5V on backlight circuit.  Please help!!"
