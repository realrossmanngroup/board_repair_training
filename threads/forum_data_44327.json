Replaced <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C7090</CAPACITOR> repairing some lines between them. After that got PPBUS 8.06 that seems to be that my smc doesnt work. heat it with flux and now i am getting 8.61V. All other rails are present, machine charges battery but doesnt turn on.\n\n\nWhat can i check next?\n\nThanks\n\n\nP.S. all sys pwrg missing."
