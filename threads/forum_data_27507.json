A1286 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2009 , Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2255, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2330, 820-2532, 820-2523, 820-2533, 820-2850, 820-2915, 820-3330..",

        "C9560": "What is C9560? Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."
