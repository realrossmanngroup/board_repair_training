        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. ."

All g3h rails confirmed present \n\nShutdown doesn't occur when flex cable (brand new) is unplugged.  CPU powers and heats up in this state."

I don't understand why though! in the magsafe2 cables there are only two wires so the charger can't be adding any intelligence over what is inside the magsafe port. And my cables were original apple ones! Any thoughts? The board is drawing about 10W with the battery plugged in\nI will plug in a screen over lunch and see whether the back light issue persists.\nthanks."
