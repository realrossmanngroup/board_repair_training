            "message": "Was liquid damaged but cleaned by another repair shop so i can not see any corrosion. I asked the other shop if they could remember or had pictures of the damage but no luck.\n\nSymptoms:\n\nWhen AC connected fans starts to spin then stop then start and slowly goes faster and faster\n\nAt the moment where fans stop for 1-2 seconds there is 3.3V on p5 and p6 on <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> (<SIGNAL>SPI_MLB_IO0_MOSI</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SPI_MLB_CLK</SIGNAL>) but at the moment the second spin starts these two values go down to some mV.\n\nI dont have board view for this one and bus termination resistors are positioned a bit different than the 00163 board view so i am having trouble measuring all of them. But the ones i can see the traces measure fine.\n\nI tried replacing <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> temporarily but it did not help so i put the original one back\n\nI tried replacing SMC but same issue\n\nAny ideas?"
