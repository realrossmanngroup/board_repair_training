I asked the other shop if they could remember or had pictures of the damage but no luck.\n\nSymptoms:\n\nWhen AC connected fans starts to spin then stop then start and slowly goes faster and faster\n\nAt the moment where fans stop for 1-2 seconds there is 3.3V on p5 and p6 on U6100 (SPI_MLB_IO0_MOSI and SPI_MLB_CLK) but at the moment the second spin starts these two values go down to some mV.\n\nI dont have board view for this one and bus termination resistors are positioned a bit different than the 00163 board view so i am having trouble measuring all of them. But the ones i can see the traces measure fine.\n\nI tried replacing U6100 temporarily but it did not help so i put the original one back\n\nI tried replacing SMC but same issue\n\nAny ideas?"}

The common checks would be U1900\/U1950\/U6100 resistors. Inspect board closer for corrosion, it is always visible if you look close enough."}
