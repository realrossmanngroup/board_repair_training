            "message": "Hello. I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that had liquid damage on the right side of the board and <SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground inside of the board, under <CAPACITOR>C9587</CAPACITOR>. Since the short is inside of the board, I cannot clear the short. This board has 512GB SSD, so 5 SSD chips total (4 on the right and 1 on the left). I have already removed all 4 SSD's from the right side. I know you can make this board work using only 2 or 4 SSD chips on the right, but my question is can you use the left side instead of the right side? Anyone know if you can just solder 512GB SSD using <CHIP>U8600</CHIP> - <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and get it work?"
