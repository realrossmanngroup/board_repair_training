I have a 820-01700 board that had liquid damage on the right side of the board and PP2V5_NAND_SSD0 was shorted to ground inside of the board, under C9587. Since the short is inside of the board, I cannot clear the short. This board has 512GB SSD, so 5 SSD chips total (4 on the right and 1 on the left). I have already removed all 4 SSD's from the right side. I know you can make this board work using only 2 or 4 SSD chips on the right, but my question is can you use the left side instead of the right side? Anyone know if you can just solder 512GB SSD using U8600 - U8900 and get it work?"}
