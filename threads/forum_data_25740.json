            "message": "Working on a board that had liquid, but was cleaned \"hard\" by someone; i.e., it looks like it's gone through either 2-3 cleanings (lots of white scaly buildup on everything), or maybe a long cleaning (5-10 minutes) in an UC. I can still spot tiny indications of where the liquid was, but I'm pretty stumped by this one. I have some questions about diagnosing this:\n\n1. This board has <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> (8.56v), 3v42 (3.44v), <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>5V_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL> (at <RESISTOR>R8141</RESISTOR>), <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>, etc.\n\n2. Board is missing <SIGNAL>3V3_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>5V_S0</SIGNAL>, etc. All S0 rails are missing, so board isn't getting to s0 of course.\n\n3. On <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>: pin 4: .197v; pin 12: 3.42v; pin 21: 3.42v; pin 23: 3.3v. So I'm missing my EN1 (<SIGNAL>P5VS4RS3_EN_R</SIGNAL>) for <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>. Tracing this back...\n\n4. <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> is .201v and <SIGNAL>S4_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is 0v. I believe these are both sent out at the same time, which means something earlier is likely missing...\n\n5. Found I'm also missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> as well, but I do have <SIGNAL>PM_DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL> (3.42v), so sounds like my SUS signal is my issue here...(uh oh, hopefully not dead CPU!)\n\n6. At <CHIP>U8130</CHIP>: pin1 is present (<SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL>), but I don't have <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>. Looks like this is required before <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>, even, so I believe we need to start here, right?\n\n7. Looking at <SIGNAL>P3V3SUS_EN</SIGNAL>...I've got 0v at both pins of <RESISTOR>R8190</RESISTOR>. So now I'm missing <SIGNAL>P3V3SUS_EN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL>, which is where I get stuck. Really hoping it's not a dead CPU. Maybe a clock issue? No signs of liquid near clock, and my vrtc is proper, but maybe it's damaged anyway.\n\nI replaced <CHIP>U8130</CHIP> to be safe, and no change. Still no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>, etc.\n\nI think I've offered enough information on this one, but if not, please let me know. Seems I need to get my <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> situated first. If this is not correct, please let me know! Thanks, Duke and Aprendiz."
