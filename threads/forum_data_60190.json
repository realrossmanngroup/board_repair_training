NO chime. THis does SMC reset. Hard to tell if it is PRAM resetting. \nTurning on:\nPower button, 2 seconds later = fan spin, about 12 seconds after power-up fan pauses for about 3 seconds, then spins again for about 10 seconds and pauses for 3 and repeats.\n\nReflash the firmware?"}

Not sure why and if it's an indication of anything. I can still often measure 1.05V when touching with the probe initially."}
