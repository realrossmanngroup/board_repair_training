I'll admit , I am not the best at reading schematics , but am trying to learn so please bear with me lol. \n\nVisual inspection of the board showed corrosion on <RESISTOR>R7564</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7564</CAPACITOR> . After looking futher both traces coming from <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> to <RESISTOR>R7564</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7564</CAPACITOR> were burnt in 2. Repaired both traces. I have short to ground on both 5v and 3.3v lines so I did remove <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> to see if it may be the cause of the short but it's still present with it removed. \nBelow are my power rail measurements. \n\nI'm not really sure where to go from here so hoping someone could point me in the right direction. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 8.6v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> 8.6v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL> 8.6v\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL</SIGNAL> 16.7v\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 16.7v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.42v\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> cycles between 3.8-5v with <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> attached / 1.2v with it removed - no short to ground\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> 0v - short to ground\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> 0v - short to ground\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 0v with <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> attached / .6v with it removed -- short to grd"
