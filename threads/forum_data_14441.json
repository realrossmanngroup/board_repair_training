        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",

        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

When i checked eyes saw a lot cracked capacitor on CPU VCore and other place ( only capacitor) when checked voltage <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 16.5V (should be 8.4V) After replace <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>,<TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>,<CHIP>U7100</CHIP>,<RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR>,<RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR> <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is turn back 8.4V and green light come back.\nBut now <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> not come back this voltage not get enable signal :( ( replaced <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> also)\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.3V \n\nSo do you think also dead <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> or <CHIP>U1000</CHIP> ? Do you spend more time repairing for this board ?"
