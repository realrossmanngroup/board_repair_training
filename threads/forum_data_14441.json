When i checked eyes saw a lot cracked capacitor on CPU VCore and other place ( only capacitor) when checked voltage PPBUS_G3H is 16.5V (should be 8.4V) After replace Q7030,Q7035,U7100,R7021,R7022 PPBUS_G3H is turn back 8.4V and green light come back.\nBut now PP5V_S5 and PP3V3_S5 not come back this voltage not get enable signal :( ( replaced U7200 also)\n\nPPVRTC_G3H is 3.3V \n\nSo do you think also dead U1800 or U1000 ? Do you spend more time repairing for this board ?"}
