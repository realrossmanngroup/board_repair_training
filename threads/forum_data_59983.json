        "message":"Hello,\nI'll give a quick description of the original damage and what I've done till now and then provide some measurements.\nI've attached photos with the initial damage and after removing the short on the trackpad connector.\n\nInitially, PPVIN_S4_TPAD_FUSE was shorted and the short was removed by digging 2 holes in the board.\nPP3v3_G3H was shorted as well but after injecting current it went away immediately.\nI had 5V looping on 2 ports so i reflowed one of the CD3215 (UB400) and now I had 5V stable. I replaced the chip with another one C00 but same 5V stable\nI then checked the other 2 ports and they are looping 5V now.\nI replaced both CD3215 (U3100 and U3200) on the looping side with no change. So here are the measurements now (After cleaning and drying the board)\n\nCharger Connected to U3200\n\nPP3v3_G3H - 3.3V Looping\nPP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS - 5.15V Looping\nPP3v3_UPC_XB_LDO - 3.3V Looping\nPP1v8_UPC_XB_LDOD - 1.8V Looping\nPP1v8_UPC_XB_LDOA - 1.8V Looping\nPP1v1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC - 1v1 Looping\nSMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SDA  - 3.3V Looping\nSMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SCL - 3.3v Looping\nTBA_VDDA - 5V Looping\nUSB_XB_CC1 - 0V\nUSB_XB_CC2 - 0.98V Looping\n\nCharger Connected to U3100\n\nPP3v3_G3H - 3.3V Looping\nPP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS - 5.15V Looping\nPP3v3_UPC_XA_LDO - 3.3V Looping\nPP1v8_UPC_XA_LDOD - 1.8V Looping\nPP1v8_UPC_XA_LDOA - 1.8V Looping\nPP1v1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC - 1v1 Looping\nSMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SDA  - 3.3V Looping\nSMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SCL - 3.3v Looping\nTBA_VDDA - 5V Looping\nUSB_XA_CC1 - 0V  \nUSB_XA_CC2 - 0.98V Looping\n\nCharger Connected to UB400\n\nPP3v3_G3H - 3.3V\nPP20V_USBC_TB_VBUS - 5.15V\nPP3v3_UPC_TB_LDO - 3.3V\nPP1v8_UPC_TB_LDOD - 1.8V\nPP1v8_UPC_TB_LDOA - 1.8V\nPP1v1_UPC_TB_LDO_BMC - 1v1\nSMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SDA  - 3.1V - 3.3V\nSMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SCL - 3.1V - 3.3v\nTBA_VDDA - 5V\nUSB_TB_CC1 - 0V  \nUSB_TB_CC2 - 0.98V \n\nCharger Connected to UB300\n\nPP3v3_G3H - 3.3V\nPP20V_USBC_TA_VBUS - 5.15V\nPP3v3_UPC_TA_LDO - 3.3V\nPP1v8_UPC_TA_LDOD - 1.8V\nPP1v8_UPC_TA_LDOA - 1.8V\nPP1v1_UPC_TA_LDO_BMC - 1v1\nSMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SDA  - 3.1V - 3.3V\nSMBUS_SMC_4_G3H_SCL - 3.1V - 3.3v\nTBA_VDDA - 5V\nUSB_TA_CC1 - 0.98V  \nUSB_TA_CC2 - 0V\n\nI replaced both U3100 and U3200 and they are still looping.\nObviously i can't confirm 100% the CD3215C00 I used are good but i don't have any more on hand at the moment to keep on replacing them.\nIs that a CD3215 issue or it can be something else?\n\nSummarised:\n2 USB ports are looping at 5V the other 2 have stable 5V. The looping kept even after replacing both of the cd3215\nI have no thermal camera and i can't feel any of the USB controllers to get warm."
