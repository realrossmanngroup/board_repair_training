I did a compare with a good working board at <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> i also replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> and have the same result i'm a little confused because the readings are not too far off. Where should i look from here?

Mark this one as solved i was missing a rail just as you said. Turns out i was missing <SIGNAL>PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT</SIGNAL> which comes from <CHIP>U7300</CHIP>, that was missing <SIGNAL>MEMVTT_EN</SIGNAL> signal that comes from <TRANSISTOR>Q3250</TRANSISTOR> pin 5. Turns out the <SIGNAL>MEMVTT_EN_L</SIGNAL> signal was high due to <TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> not opening the source to drain replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> and bingo fan spin again."
