Light comes on and os says the charger is plugged in.  however the battery drains.  He came in with a fake charger, so pretty sure that killed it.  Where to start on this guy?"}

There are a few possibilities here:\n\n1. R7021 is blown\n2. R7022 is blown (both could be blown as well)\n3.R7020 is blown (unlikely but possible)\n4. The traces between the ISL and R7021\/2 are blown OR between R7021\/2 and R7020 are blown.\n\nAlso a good idea to replace the ISL6259 when you figure out which of the above are true."}
