SSD_RESET_CONN_L is a signal that goes to the SSD that will put it in RESET mode which will keep it from working, when SSD_RESET_L is present. _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. .",

        "SSD_RESET_L": "What is SSD_RESET_L? SSD_RESET_L is a signal that puts the SSD in reset mode when it is low. This means the SSD will not be accessible when this signal is asserted.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v..",
