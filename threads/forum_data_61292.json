I was able to go into Recovery window and confirmed that the ssd wasn't being seen, only the portion that carriers the OS re-install file. While trying an external storage, it also won't load the OS, but gives the error about needing a critical update. \nI've tried powering the board with everything but just the display and then just external display with the same result. \n\nAny suggestions on where to start with his one?"
