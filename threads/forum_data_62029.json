            "message": "Hello everyone.\nGot some liquid spill on KB and on the housing, but none of it actually made it to the board.\n\nWell, where to start...\nBoard slow boots, then asks for critical update.\nThat's all, I suppose.\n\nWhat's done:\n- Checked for corrosion everywhere, none found\n- Checked PMU output voltages on main 4(?) Coils, seems fine to me, never checked the LDOs though.\n- Checked diode readings from anywhere the T1 goes (touchid connector, touchbar connectors, lcd connector)\nSPI/I2C lines seems fine, voltages seem to be fine too.\n- Booted OS from safe mode, there is Apple Mobile Device (Recovery Mode) as expected, seems than it can't get out of recovery.\n- Checked SPI data lines with oscope between T1 and its SPI, there is some life.\n- Being out of options, swapped T1, it's SPI and SEP from donor board. Made no difference.\n- Swapped touchbar to a \"new\" one. Never saw it working.\n- Swapped T1's PMU from donor, again, no difference.\n- Checked i2c/SPI pull-ups everywhere I can find, seems fine.\n- Booted bare board with only usbc connector, external monitor and nothing else. Same thing here. Tries to update and then rolls back to same screen asking to update.\n\nTo make it clear: this is not the network issue, not the OS issue probably, as I tried wiping SSD clean and doing a clean install of Monterey, tried booting from external Catalina, tried different Wi-Fi network, nah.\n\nSo, 2 questions:\n1) can it update T1 succesfully if there is nothing connected to it? (Touchbar, touchid, nfc, lcd, camera, als) what's the minimal setup? Anyone ever experimented?\n2) what am I missing here? Maybe there is something that needs to be checked that I've missed?\n\nThx"

You know the rest of the story.\n\nFor now I suspect pullup resistor to 1,8. There are two options that come to mind right now, either it was shorted to gnd cause it was touching some shielding below or maybe it was some solder crack or other defect, but i triple checked under microscope, and it looks fine to me. \n\nAnyway, it's getting late, I'll continue to work on this tomorrow. Maybe I find the real reason."
