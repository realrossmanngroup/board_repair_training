The CPU area and the area underneath heat up so I'm not sure if the short is the CPU itself or the circuit feeding it. <SIGNAL>PPVCCCPU_S0G</SIGNAL> is not shorted, it measures the same as a good board. Not sure if I'm looking at the usual shorted CPU or if there might be some other move here. I attached some pre-ultrasonic pictures."

I attached some pics of the top and bottom heating up. Ignore the red outline around the CPU, that happens with reflective metal. The glow to the left in that picture on the CPU is the area that's heating up once I send voltage through <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL>."
