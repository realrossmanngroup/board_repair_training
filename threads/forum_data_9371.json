        "message":"Got this MacBook Air 2014 today. It is slightly water damaged, I can see some corrosion around U5450 (replaced this) and at the trackpad cable (cleaned this one).\nIt turns on when connecting the charger, the fan spins high all the time. It only has green light some of the time, it does not see battery. I have tried with a new IO board and signal cable.\nWhen trying to install macOS it stops telling me it cannot install if not connected to a power outlet, which of course it is.\nI will not turn off while holding down the power button.\nI have tried the board with a new keyboard and new trackpad. Both the old and the new keyboard\/trackpad combination seems to work fine in macOS.\n\nAs far as I can tell there is no ASD for this board, or can I use ASD for the 2013 model since it has the same logic board?"
