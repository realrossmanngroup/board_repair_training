Thank you in advance .\n\n820-3462 when it goes sleep wont wake up\n\nI really dont have much idea how sleep awake cycle works .\n\nI have checked the S3 and S4 rails all of them has power while mac sleeping .\n\nI have start to measure around enables due to  Mobile System Power State Table [FONT=Courier](Power Control 1\/ENABLE)[\/FONT]\nBut couldn't find the source of the problem .\n\nI am looking for some wisdom to figure out the issue and understand how sleep awake cycle works .\nThank you."

The only thing to check is if the system enters sleep that all S3 power stays on. After that it is just stabbing in the dark, very complex problem. Although it may be only 1 resistor or FET, this will be a nightmare to diagnose. I still say liquid damage somewhere, possible cleaned already."
