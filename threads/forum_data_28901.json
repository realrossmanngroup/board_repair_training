The resistance to ground is good on all the pads. I replaced U7701. No change. Not sure why, but it looks like there's a surge coming into R7731. Or something is happening on the other end through R7715 and U7701. Board is otherwise functional."}

Why do you think they are dead?\nYou could do some basic math and calculate wattage with the voltage present and resistance. P=V^2\/R. 0201 resistor is typically 0.05W."}

I'm measuring no shorts."}
