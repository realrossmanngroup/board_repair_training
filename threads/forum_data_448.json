        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "C6908": "What is C6908? a CAPACITOR.",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line..",
        "U6900": "What is U6900? a CHIP.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "CHGR_ACOK": "What is CHGR_ACOK? This is identical to SMC_BC_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working.

        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
