The idea here is that it will power U6900 which allows the charger to talk to the SMC if the ISL6259\/U7000 says that it is ok for it to. So follow to the next logical step - is U6900 getting 3.4v? Is U6901 shooting out 3.4v for U6900? If not, why?"}

Measure voltage. Is it steady or does it move?"}

At this point since you've already replaced U7200, my guess is bad SMC."}

I then plugged in power and measured dc voltage on SMC_PM_G2_EN and got a very low mv on probe point 1006.\nCould be possible that the u7200 I replaced was bad? There was very little liquid spill on the machine, I pulled the U7200 off a donor board from china. I feel like I might be missing something from my inexperience , that maybe effecting diagnosis. Having g3hot and the 12v rail just seems like the problem might be the technician. :)\nThe PP5V_S5_LDO with power plugged in, checked at probe point 650 reads from dc voltage of 2.8v to 3.6v fluctuating rapidly and at SMC_PM_G2_EN its basically nothing"}

That should be at 3.4v immediately. My guess here is SMC if SMC_RESET_L is present as well as PP3V42_G3H. You need SMC_PM_G2_EN to create PP5V_S5 and get the ball rolling with everything else."}

(she has never done that before)\nWe were able to get green light on the charger by running a wire to fix the one wire circuit. (first wire was hideous, but the second one was much nicer) Have never done that before. \nWe where able to get the 12v circuit running.\nSuccessfully soldered the ISL6259 (took three tries:o)\nWe where not able to get the 5v up because of the SMC, however It was a great success for us at least because we are learning how to problem solve these boards.\n\nI used to send all my boards to your favorite company (L2 Computer) :o I sent them enough that I was getting them at $180\nAlthough I didn't get this board to work, I didn't send it to them either. Another success!\nEventually, We will learn more and have even greater success\n\nThanks for all you guys are doing!"}
