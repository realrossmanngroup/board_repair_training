Because on a ggod working board we should have the same values for SDA and SCL right?\nIn my case the only one left it's the smc, as <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, the battery and the BIL board are not in the \"loop\" anymore right?\nAlso I've forgot to mention that I've replaced the <CHIP>ISL6258</CHIP> and it's still the same and the values in diode more are\nSDA: 0.482V\nSCL: 0.498V\n\nIn SMC Byass mode both line have a solid 3.41V : no communication\nMy last chance is to re assemble everything and try an SMC Reset......will let you know later....\nThanks So far"

Maybe I should check the battery of my fluke.......\n\n@ 2Informaticos: no pb if I use soldering paste instead of ball which i don't have......?"
