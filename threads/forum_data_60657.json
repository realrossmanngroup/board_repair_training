        "A1304": "What is A1304? A1304 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Mid 2009 with EMC 2334, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2375..",
        "820-2375": "What is 820-2375? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PP18V5_G3H": "What is PP18V5_G3H? a SIGNAL.",
