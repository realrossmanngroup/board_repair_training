        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "R7050": "What is R7050? Current sense shunt resistor for the battery, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 17/18 on ISL6259 should give you 2.02 ohms. .",
        "R7052": "What is R7052? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

        "SMBUS_BATT_SCL": "What is SMBUS_BATT_SCL? SMBUS_BATT_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "SMBUS_BATT_SDA": "What is SMBUS_BATT_SDA? SMBUS_BATT_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "R5280": "What is R5280? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",
        "R5281": "What is R5281? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",

I have repaired these and checked all current sensors the only issue I could find was there is no continuity between <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7052</RESISTOR> I have tried cleaning the via but am unable to find anything rigid and thing enough to fit throug it so I have ran a Jumper between the 2. The charger just stays green. <TRANSISTOR>Q7005</TRANSISTOR> has 12.27v on pins 1-3 pin 4 has 12.24, pins 5-8 have .6v \nReadings on the battery connector are  7-9  are .6v. \n6 is 3.4\n5 is 0v\n4 is 3.4\nAny pointers welcome"
