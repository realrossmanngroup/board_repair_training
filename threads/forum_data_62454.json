Nothing more seems to be damaged, but liquid could have been through more components.\n\n[U][B]Behavior :[\/B][\/U] the board works fine when battery is not connected, I have been able to backup data. But when battery is connected, the fan start to spin for 20 seconds, no chime nor image, and out of the blue the fans go full speed for one second and the Mac shuts off. It does it in loop. \n\n[U][B]Tried so far : [\/B][\/U]I started with battery and battery cable swap with a known good one, same behavior. Removed J4801 that looked bad, don't know why I did that...\n\nDo you have any guess ? It's the first time I see something like this. Any help is welcome, thank you for your time."}
