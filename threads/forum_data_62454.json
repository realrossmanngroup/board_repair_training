        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15‚Äù Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",

        "PPBUS_G3": "What is PPBUS_G3? This is a typo of PPBUS_G3H. When you see PPBUS_G3, assume they meant to type PPBUS_G3H.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

I2C_PWR_SCL is the clock line of the SMBUS data line between the system management controller(SMC), battery, ISL9240 battery charging chip, and power management unit(PMU). This line is necessary for the machine to communicate with the battery, see the battery, and use the battery. When this line is malfunctioning or shorted to ground, the machine will have an X icon over the battery and not run off the battery. .",

Nothing more seems to be damaged, but liquid could have been through more components.\n\n[U][B]Behavior :[/B][/U] the board works fine when battery is not connected, I have been able to backup data. But when battery is connected, the fan start to spin for 20 seconds, no chime nor image, and out of the blue the fans go full speed for one second and the Mac shuts off. It does it in loop. \n\n[U][B]Tried so far : [/B][/U]I started with battery and battery cable swap with a known good one, same behavior. Removed J4801 that looked bad, don't know why I did that...\n\nDo you have any guess ? It's the first time I see something like this. Any help is welcome, thank you for your time."
