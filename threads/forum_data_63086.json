Same when used for an extended period of time.\n\nPrevious liquid damage around <CHIP>U3890</CHIP>/5 doesn't seem to be related to SSD lines. Also, some around <RESISTOR>R3773</RESISTOR> and <CHIP>U3700</CHIP> corner.\n\nTested with two good known SSDs, reinstalled still an intermittent issue. Cant measure with a board outside of the case when an issue occurs hence omitted some measurements.\n\nJ8600 - When Problem Occurs\n4 - 0.24V\n5 - 0.003V - <SIGNAL>SSD_PWR_EN_CONN_L</SIGNAL>\n6 - 1.78V - <SIGNAL>SSD_BOOT_CONN_L</SIGNAL>\n7 -\n8 - 0V\n9 - 3.4V\n10 - 3.2V\n11 -\n12 -\n13 - 3.2V\n\nLooking at[URL='https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a-hdd-problem.63074/'] @tipoti trouble[/URL] when it's working, measurements seem to be the same as mine when not working.\n\nCleaned the connector multiple times and inspected under a scope. No damage."
