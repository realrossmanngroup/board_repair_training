If gone on System Preferences >> Sound >> Output >> No output devices found.  Input >> No input devices found.  I thought that it could be a Software issues, so I went ahead and reformatted the hard drive and set up the computer as a New computer without customers data.  Still the computer does not show any output and input devices.  Can you help me in solving this issue."
