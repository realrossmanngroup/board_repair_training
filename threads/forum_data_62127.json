        "message":"Hello there,\n\nI replaced the left internal speaker of a MacBook Pro Retina Mid 2012. Easy repair, not even worth to mention on this forum.\n\nBut... when rebooting, the display suddenly had hiccups (or a heartbeat) every 3 seconds.\nThe lower part of the screen jumps up one centimeter and then goes back.\nI have added a small zipped recording as attachment, as you probably can interpret the above in many ways.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea where to start looking? Is there some circuit polling for something every 3 seconds which is somehow captured by the graphics card?\n\nI have ruled out any peripheral components: it already appears when only the keyboard, screen and power supply are connected to the logic board.\nI do not have a spare screen to test if it would be the display.\nWhen connecting a secondary screen to the HDMI output, the phenomenon does not appear on the external display.\n\nAny help would be highly appreciated.\n\nBest regards,\n\nStijn"
