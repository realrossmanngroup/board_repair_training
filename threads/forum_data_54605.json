        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15‚Äù Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

During the period that it won't power on, i plugged in the MagSafe and the light on the MagSafe would some times never lights up until the SMC reset. Other times it lights up orange, never goes through the initial green then orange until i do the smc reset. Can't seem to create the same fail with MagSafe connected when the computer is put into sleep mode. I've replaced the battery with the same result. \n\nCould this be SMC related?\n\nAny suggestions"

Some how i missed this during my initial scan of the board. Anyway, replaced all of them and the laptop is now fixed.\n\nThanks guys again for all the assist"
