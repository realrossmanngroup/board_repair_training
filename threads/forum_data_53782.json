But it is...\nThese machines are awful.\n\nI have ordered a stencil for these processors and copper shims to replace the crap iphone X heat conducting paste. I have the nozzle on the way for my BGA rework machine. I figured I would change a few of these processors and see if I can fix any. I have a drawer full of these boards all with CPU drama.. The processors are not that expensive but the working boards sure are!"
