I got a schematic and boardview for a close model. location of the parts on the board are a bit shuffled, but schematic ics seem to match. Here link to the Schematic and Boardview -  [URL='https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqUpFIbofx3Hl5wJE05zzzeM_VvZdA?e=bqp3bc']Lenovo FLEX 5-14ALC05 â€“ LC56-14A SVT[/URL]\n\nI got two of these, both have been connected to the same (doggy?) usbc, which blew them one by one. \nI have detected a short on the 5V line and traced it down to <CHIP>U7204</CHIP> (which was glowing at 1V over 5V line). Replaced it, and the short is gone. However, I cannot get 3.3 and 5V lines to fire up.\n\nPU4501 is heating up slightly and was dropping the DCBATOUT voltage from 19 to 9 V. After replacement, it now stays at 19V with no drop.\nNow still slight heat signature on PU4501 bench shows 19V/0.04A\n\n\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"1149px\"]61161[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]61163[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]61162[/ATTACH]\n\nPU4501/4551, same voltages\nP1 - 4.5V\nP2 - 19V\nP6 - 0V\nP9 - 0V\nP11 - 4.7V\nP12 - 0V\nP13 - 0V\nP14 - 0V\nP15 - 5V / 2.7V\nP17 - 5V"
