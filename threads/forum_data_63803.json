Same thing with ALL_SYS_PWRGD and SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD.\nIf I trigger SMC_ONOFF_L, CPU_VCORE will pulse only once.\nIf I do an smc bypass, I see the fan spins twice and stop :eek::eek::eek:\n\nIs there any hope I can check something else or most likely a PCH issue? Especially that i have no liquid damage...\nThanks"}
