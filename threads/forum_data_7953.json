        "message":"I have this 820-3115-B this machine did have water damage around the isl6259. i get no green light on the charger( even though i have 3.42v on the onewire) but no smc_bc_acok coming from the isl6259 which is where its created i believe... so i did some more checking around noticed that i get nothing on the charger Agate. i get 6.87v on one side of r7086 (the resistance on r7086 is .332 kh) and nothing on the other side.\n\nany idea on that?"
