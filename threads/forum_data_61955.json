After fixing this the board now behaves as follows:\nIt starts normally when booting for the first time. After that it always gets stuck at approx. 223mA.\nIf it has been off for a while, it starts up again normally for one boot process. Then again stuck at 223mA ...\n\nI measured all Power Aliases from page 62 while it stucks at 223mA - they are all good.\nCan you give me a tip on how to continue troubleshooting?"}

I have videos from the board before beginning with work - if it helps i can give an downloadlink or upload a view pictures.\n\nWhat i did now:\nI made a new BIOS with Medusa3 from a Donor with clean ME and PRAM.\nAnd i changed U1900 because it had a bit corrosion before and was only cleaned with flux.\nAt my first test the board was booting two times like normal up to 500-600mA.\nBut after this it is now only booting to 223mA every time.\nI changed U1900 a second time - just in case the chip is not good - same behavior. \nAround U6100, U6101, U1900, Y1905 and J6100 i measured in diode-mode all the values from FlexBV OBData - all seems good.\nFYI - i can't see any data transfer on the oszi at the Circuits from the BIOS. They have 3.3v but no data signs."}
