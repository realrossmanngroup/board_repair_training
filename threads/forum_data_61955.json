I have videos from the board before beginning with work - if it helps i can give an downloadlink or upload a view pictures.\n\nWhat i did now:\nI made a new BIOS with Medusa3 from a Donor with clean ME and PRAM.\nAnd i changed <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> because it had a bit corrosion before and was only cleaned with flux.\nAt my first test the board was booting two times like normal up to 500-600mA.\nBut after this it is now only booting to 223mA every time.\nI changed <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> a second time - just in case the chip is not good - same behavior. \nAround <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>, <CHIP>U6101</CHIP>, <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>, Y1905 and J6100 i measured in diode-mode all the values from FlexBV OBData - all seems good.\nFYI - i can't see any data transfer on the oszi at the Circuits from the BIOS. They have 3.3v but no data signs."
