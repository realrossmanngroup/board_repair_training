It was running with typical screen blsckout issues so I resoldered U8900 with leaded solder but without success. So I wanted to replace U8900. While removing it, it slipped out the tweezers and landed straight on the components around R8918. I put them back on place carefully and replaced U8900.\nNow the Macbook does not turn on anymore. ALL_SYS_PWRGOOD is missing because of missing PPVCCSA_S0_REG.\nU7100  gets power and enable voltage.\n\nThank you and best regards\nDudi"}
