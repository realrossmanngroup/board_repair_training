It was running with typical screen blsckout issues so I resoldered <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> with leaded solder but without success. So I wanted to replace <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>. While removing it, it slipped out the tweezers and landed straight on the components around <RESISTOR>R8918</RESISTOR>. I put them back on place carefully and replaced <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>.\nNow the Macbook does not turn on anymore. <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGOOD</SIGNAL> is missing because of missing <SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_REG</SIGNAL>.\n<CHIP>U7100</CHIP>  gets power and enable voltage.\n\nThank you and best regards\nDudi"
