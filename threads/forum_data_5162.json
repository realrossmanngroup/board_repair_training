        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "5V_S5": "What is 5V_S5? 5V_S5 is an abbreviation for “PP5V_S5” which is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 state. .",
        "PP1V05_SUS": "What is PP1V05_SUS? The PP1V05_SUS signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that supplies 1.05 volts, typically used in a suspended (SUS) state of the laptop. This state is a low-power mode where essential system functions are maintained, but the majority of the system is powered down..",
        "P5VS4RS3_EN": "What is P5VS4RS3_EN? PP5VS4RS3_EN is a signal that enables the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail. When you see _EN in front of a signal name, it means that it is enabling whatever comes before the _EN when the signal is high..",

        "C1300": "What is C1300? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PCH_INTVRMEN": "What is PCH_INTVRMEN? PCH_INTVRMEN is an Internal Voltage Regulator Enable: When pulled high, this signal enables\nthe internal 1.05 V regulators for the Suspend well in the PCH. This signal must\nremain asserted for the VRMs to behave properly (no glitches allowed).\nThis signal must be pulled-up to VCCRTC on desktop platforms and may\noptionally be pulled low on mobile platforms if using an external VR for the\nVCCSUS rail.",

So here is exactly what happens to mine:\n\nIt came with LD but almost impossible to notice. I did a UC but nothing changed.\n\n1) Green -> Orange Light OK\n2) 3V42, PPBUS, PPVRTC, <SIGNAL>5V_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V05_SUS</SIGNAL> OK\n3) SMC seems alive, various lines produce pulses, voltages are there, there is 32KHz clock going in, maybe I need to check something more specific?\n4) SPI looks and feels good\n5) <SIGNAL>P5VS4RS3_EN</SIGNAL> missing => <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> also missing\n\nAlso it does not start with <CAPACITOR>C1300</CAPACITOR> & <CAPACITOR>C1303</CAPACITOR> removed.\n\nThank you in advance,\n\ng"

I also checked surrounding pads but there is continuity.\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> looks dead, not jumping up&down.\n\nyou think this broken line (<SIGNAL>SPI_CS0_L</SIGNAL>) could have corrupted the BIOS? is a re-flashing attempt worth it?\n\napologies for the long delay between responses.\n\n\nEDIT: weird behaviour detected. After plugging in the charger a few times the light went GREEN->off (instead of ORANGE) and the fan started spinning and the CPU got hot. Repeating the procedure with the magsafe adapter makes the light go Green -> Orange and no fan spin. A few tries later fan spin again. Then nothing... Any clues?\n\nEDIT2: <SIGNAL>SMC_SENSOR_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> also missing.. maybe irrelevant?"
