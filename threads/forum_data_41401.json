            "message": "Working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that fails a ton of external video tests only (all internal pass, MUX tests pass, but 8 or 9 external video tests--mainly the rendering tests--fail, etc), and board performs OK until under even moderate stress, then it starts artifacting. I've uploaded a short video showing the anomaly which can be seen here: [URL]https://imgur.com/a/YN2Zc9P[/URL]\n\nI have hope it may not be GPU, only because I've NEVER seen this particular type of artifacting on this board. The blue triangles show constantly while running heaven, but no anomalies when just performing normal tasks, so I don't think it's the GMUX either. Was suspecting damage to board, but no caps or anything missing from GPU face or area of board. Now thinking possibly VRAM.\n\nAny ideas? Should I reflow GPU or is this a bad chip?"
