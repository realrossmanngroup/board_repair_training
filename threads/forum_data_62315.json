        "A1278": "What is A1278? A1278 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook or Macbook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2254, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2327, 820-2530, 820-2879, 820-2936, 820-3115..",
        "820-3115B": "What is 820-3115B? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPVTT_S0_DDR_LDO": "What is PPVTT_S0_DDR_LDO? a SIGNAL.",
        "DDRVTT_EN": "What is DDRVTT_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
        "R7403": "What is R7403? a RESISTOR.",
        "U7400": "What is U7400? a CHIP."
