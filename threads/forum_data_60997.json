Replaced everything and board was fully booting into OS. Appeared to be fixed.\n\nAfter running OS for a bit board suddenly died. Now when trying to turn on the fan spins on and off twice but nothing else happens, not the normal on and off 3 times. Vcore present at 1.7V\n\nTried known good bios with no change.\n\nShould should be checked next???"
