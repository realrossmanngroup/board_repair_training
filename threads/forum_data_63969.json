I can see that p5g3s is only 90 ohms from ground. A little low isnt it?"}

SO i injected 5V. I can see U810 heating up clearly. Took it off, normal diode readings. Then i replaced with another \"GAY\" chip from a different model donor. (i'm literally trying to find the donor i got it off and can't find it). The one that was originally on there is \"GAY SJN\" the one i replaced it with is GAY SJ5\nIt's the only chip i found that looks like is the right one. And sure enough it has normal diode reading with this but it still doesnt boot\n\nalso i think i solved the trackpad click mystery, there was a little tweezer nick in the flex, i sorted that and the click is back"}
