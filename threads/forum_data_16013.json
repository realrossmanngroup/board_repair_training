This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
