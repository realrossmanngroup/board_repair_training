        "message":"Hello All,\n\nI've got a touchbar from a friend that had some liquid spilled on.\nHowever, it looked pretty clean inside aside from some sticky brown mess on L7960 (cocke?)\n\nIt did not power on and had a short to ground on ppbus_g3h.\nSince there's a lot of stuff on ppbus_g3h I decided to inject some voltage in ppbus_g3h.\nAfter injecting voltage on c6483, U7270 became hot.\nReplaced U7270 and got a lot more voltages and obviously no short on ppbus_g3h anymore.\n\nHowever After a quick coil mesuring, I got the following.\nNo chime,no image, no fan spin. Cpu does get warm.\n\nthe ones that stay low:\n\nL7270 --> 0.007 - 0.010 \nL7220 --> 0.027\nL7210 --> 0.027\nL7410 --> 0.002\nL7420 --> 0.002\nL7430 --> 0.002\n\nThe other ones:\n\nL3500 --> 0.005 - 0.000\nL8410 --> 0.019\nL7030 --> 13.06\nL7660 --> 3.357\nL7600 --> 5.144\nL7700 --> 1.056\nLB7000 --> 0.004 - 0.000\nL9400 --> 2.696\nL7900 --> 1.203\nL7960 --> 0.979\nL8050 --> 1.005\nL8000 --> 1.023\n\nVoltages mesured:\n\npp5v_s0 --> 5.145\npp5v_s0_vccsa --> 5.145\nppbus_hs_cpu --> 13.05\n\nany suggestions?\n\np.s.
