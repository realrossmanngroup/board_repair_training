Cpu does get warm.\n\nthe ones that stay low:\n\nL7270 --> 0.007 - 0.010 \nL7220 --> 0.027\nL7210 --> 0.027\nL7410 --> 0.002\nL7420 --> 0.002\nL7430 --> 0.002\n\nThe other ones:\n\nL3500 --> 0.005 - 0.000\nL8410 --> 0.019\nL7030 --> 13.06\nL7660 --> 3.357\nL7600 --> 5.144\nL7700 --> 1.056\nLB7000 --> 0.004 - 0.000\nL9400 --> 2.696\nL7900 --> 1.203\nL7960 --> 0.979\nL8050 --> 1.005\nL8000 --> 1.023\n\nVoltages mesured:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> --> 5.145\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_VCCSA</SIGNAL> --> 5.145\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> --> 13.05\n\nany suggestions?\n\np.s.
