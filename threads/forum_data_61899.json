        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "CPU_VCCST_PWRGD": "What is CPU_VCCST_PWRGD? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_PBUS_VSENSE": "What is SMC_PBUS_VSENSE? a SIGNAL.",

        "SMC_TPAD_RST_L": "What is SMC_TPAD_RST_L? SMC_TPAD_RST_L is a signal that comes from the trackpad that can reset the SMC when it is low.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. The trackpad having corrosion from liquid damage is a very common cause of no light on the magsafe charger & the system not turning on, when the trackpad or trackpad cable is corroded and holding this line down. .",
