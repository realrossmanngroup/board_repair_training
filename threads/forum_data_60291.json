        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U5701": "What is U5701? this is the keyboard controller chip that takes the keyboard and trackpad input and turns it into a USB device signal for the machine to process. If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",
        "BUTTON_DISABLE": "What is BUTTON_DISABLE? BUTTON_DISABLE disables the trackpad when SMC_LID is below 0.5v and the system believes the lid is closed. .",

        "SMC_LID_R": "What is SMC_LID_R? SMC_LID_R is the signal coming from the hall sensor that detects whether the laptop screen is closed or open. This must be high in order for SMC_LID to be high. SMC_LID has to be high for the machine to not fall asleep and for it to have a backlight..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
