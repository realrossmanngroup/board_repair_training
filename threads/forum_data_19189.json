Tested <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> & <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>, got ~1v going to pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> but 0v going to pin 4 <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>. Replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and still no <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> (any higher). Resistance between <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> pins 28 & 27 is ~20ohms, pins 17 & 18 ~2.2ohms. \n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_CSI_P</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>CHGR_CSI_N</SIGNAL> are getting ~16.5v (should be enough right?)\n\nI'm thinking it's a fried SMC? The SMC looks to have two little bulges on the surface of it, is that indicative of damage?"

There was a short on <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> which would drop voltage from pp18v5 to like 10v, replaced and voltage was steady pre-<CHIP>U6990</CHIP> but 0v on pp3v42. Went ahead and replaced the SMC because fuck it why not right? And I got pp3v42 now. But I'm still not getting any g3h, and now <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> isn't sending voltage to <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>."
