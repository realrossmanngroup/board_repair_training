            "message": "Hey everyone another day, another issue\n\nI have this 2936 board here where someone messed with before. I already fixed a area where their \"put it full of flux and heat it up\" procedure knocked an important pull-up resistor off.\nRight now I managed to have all S0 power lines there, but I can't get <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> to become high\n\nI've already replaced <RESISTOR>R7951</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7952</RESISTOR> as they did not mesure their right values, however the replacements do exactly the same which makes me think my multimeter can't calculate it properly as its a divider.\n\n\nThese are the values I measured, with the resistors I've written down their supposed values from the datasheet after the Part#:\n\n[CODE]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_VMON</SIGNAL>: 3.29V\n<RESISTOR>R7951</RESISTOR> (15k): 7.16k\n<RESISTOR>R7952</RESISTOR> (7.15k): 5.35k\n<SIGNAL>VMON_3V3_DIV</SIGNAL>: 0.76V\n<RESISTOR>R7933</RESISTOR> (1k): 0.993k\n<SIGNAL>VMON_Q2_BASE</SIGNAL>: 0.7V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_VMON</SIGNAL>: 3.30V\n<RESISTOR>R7956</RESISTOR> (150k): 148.7k\n<SIGNAL>S0PGD_C</SIGNAL>: 0.13V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3RS0_VMON</SIGNAL>: 1.48V\n<RESISTOR>R7954</RESISTOR> (1k): 0.995k\n<SIGNAL>VMON_Q3_BASE</SIGNAL>: 0.78V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0_VMON</SIGNAL>: 1.03V\n<RESISTOR>R7955</RESISTOR> (1k): 1.007k\n<SIGNAL>VMON_Q4_BASE</SIGNAL>: 0.74V\n\n<RESISTOR>R7957</RESISTOR> (100): 99.6\n<SIGNAL>S0PGD_BJT_GND_R</SIGNAL>: 0.109V\n\nBetween Q2&Q3 (Pin 8): 0.135V\nBetween Q3&Q4 (Pin 2): 0.127V\n\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>: 0.049V\n\n[/CODE]\n\nAny idea what could be it? It feels once again like the answer is right in front of my nose but I just can't quite put my finger on it.\n\nCheers!"
