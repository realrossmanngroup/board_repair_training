I already fixed a area where their \"put it full of flux and heat it up\" procedure knocked an important pull-up resistor off.\nRight now I managed to have all S0 power lines there, but I can't get ALL_SYS_PWRGD to become high\n\nI've already replaced R7951 and R7952 as they did not mesure their right values, however the replacements do exactly the same which makes me think my multimeter can't calculate it properly as its a divider.\n\n\nThese are the values I measured, with the resistors I've written down their supposed values from the datasheet after the Part#:\n\n[CODE]PP3V3_S0_VMON: 3.29V\nR7951 (15k): 7.16k\nR7952 (7.15k): 5.35k\nVMON_3V3_DIV: 0.76V\nR7933 (1k): 0.993k\nVMON_Q2_BASE: 0.7V\n\nPP3V3_S5_VMON: 3.30V\nR7956 (150k): 148.7k\nS0PGD_C: 0.13V\n\nPP1V5_S3RS0_VMON: 1.48V\nR7954 (1k): 0.995k\nVMON_Q3_BASE: 0.78V\n\nPP1V05_S0_VMON: 1.03V\nR7955 (1k): 1.007k\nVMON_Q4_BASE: 0.74V\n\nR7957 (100): 99.6\nS0PGD_BJT_GND_R: 0.109V\n\nBetween Q2&Q3 (Pin 8): 0.135V\nBetween Q3&Q4 (Pin 2): 0.127V\n\nALL_SYS_PWRGD: 0.049V\n\n[\/CODE]\n\nAny idea what could be it? It feels once again like the answer is right in front of my nose but I just can't quite put my finger on it.\n\nCheers!"}

At this point I think the best would be to test continuity on VCCSAS0_DRVL, VCCSAS0_LL and VCCSAS0_DRH and maybe replace Q7100?"}
