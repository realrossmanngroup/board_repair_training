Replaced an SMC from donnour board and it\u2019s bad, it spins 2-3 seconds, stops, and spin forever. Fan is at full max right after pluging magsafe...Pretty confident for the soldering.\n\nMy question: is there any difference from late-2013 or 2014 820-3476-A SMC\u2019s?\nthanks"

Very rare in my case maybe 1 bad smc over 25...\n\nThanks"
