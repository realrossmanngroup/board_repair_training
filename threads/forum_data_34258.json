            "message": "Tricky one here.\n\nCustomer Stated that it did not recognize SSD and Thunderbolt Ethernet does not work. Works fine on external drives and thunderbolt does work for display, Just not ethernet. I have a feeling these are connected and its an issue with PCIE. SSD Reset L is at 3.3v and i have 3.3V at L4500 and at the Connector. I have .4v on <SIGNAL>PCIE_CLK100M_SSD_P</SIGNAL> and N. [Can anyone confirm this is correct? i feel it should be at the same Voltage as the rest of the logic] and 3.3V on <SIGNAL>SSD_CLKREQ_L</SIGNAL>. <SIGNAL>SATA_PCIE_SEL</SIGNAL> is at 3.05V that seems low to me, but I'm unsure.\n\nI Looked up <CHIP>U4510</CHIP> and it seems to be getting correct voltage but when i look at the data sheet it says SEL needs to be Low to Run in PCIE mode. is that what I'm missing here? i thought these SSDs used PCIE not Sata. I also checked XSD and it is low as it should be.\n\nAny Ideas on what to check next?\n\nthanks\n\n<CHIP>U4500</CHIP> Data Sheet\n[url]https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/CBTL02043A_CBTL02043B.pdf[/url]"

After spending a ridiculous amount of time trying to troubleshoot the SSD not being recognized checked all pice lines and clocks, Replaced <CHIP>U4510</CHIP>. Was about to quit. I then realized the customers SSD and Mine was formatted for APFS. For some reason this machine would not recognize it with that format. Erased to HFS and is recognized fine. Could never recreate the thunderbolt issue here in store. Close this please. Thank you."
