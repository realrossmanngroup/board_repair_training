        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC": "What is PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA": "What is PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA? PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state that powers the SMC that comes from PP3V3_S5. A blown or corroded L4901 inductor behind it can kepe it from working, inductor number will differ depending on your board. .",
