The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

You can de-solder the shield by pulling it up with your tweezers while heating up the sides where its attached to the board with. I assume its very similar to removing shields on iPhone motherboards, because I have never removed a shield from a macbook\n\nIf its indeed getting awfully hot when injecting voltage, remove it and see if the short goes away.\nIf there is corrosion in that area and the chip does not get very warm you could try a reflow with some nice flux first, you might have corrosion bridging some traces to ground.\nIf the chip is just at room temperature its most likely not the chip but internally inside the board"
