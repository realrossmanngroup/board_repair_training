            "message": "Hello guys,\nif after visual inspection traces of corrosions are detected around pins of IC chips and resistors/capacitors, is it really necessary to replace the components?\nI wonder if it may be sufficient to desolder components, clean placeholders /pads on the board and return the same components back to the board.\nDoes corrosion on pins/legs really kill the components?\n\nNo long ago, I have repaired <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, by cleaning the green tracesnear <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>. Both <RESISTOR>R1950</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C1950</CAPACITOR> had green stuff on their pads, so I put flux, removed componets, cleaned pads and returned the same components. I used alcohol to clean around U195, und reflowd with a bit of flux.\n\nLaptop started working and as far as I know, it still works. But on many youtbe videos, all these components are replaced."

            "message": "If pads get better after cleaning, should not be a problem for integrated circuits.\n\nYou should check resistors and caps value; at least in theory.\nIf you still have problems after (only) cleaning, then is surely the moment to do that."
