        "message":"Hello guys,\nif after visual inspection traces of corrosions are detected around pins of IC chips and resistors\/capacitors, is it really necessary to replace the components?\nI wonder if it may be sufficient to desolder components, clean placeholders \/pads on the board and return the same components back to the board.\nDoes corrosion on pins\/legs really kill the components?\n\nNo long ago, I have repaired 820-3437, by cleaning the green tracesnear U1950. Both R1950 and C1950 had green stuff on their pads, so I put flux, removed componets, cleaned pads and returned the same components. I used alcohol to clean around U195, und reflowd with a bit of flux.\n\nLaptop started working and as far as I know, it still works. But on many youtbe videos, all these components are replaced."

        "message":"If pads get better after cleaning, should not be a problem for integrated circuits.\n\nYou should check resistors and caps value; at least in theory.\nIf you still have problems after (only) cleaning, then is surely the moment to do that."
