            "message": "Hi, Can I get some advice please. I have a 2013 15” MBP <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> that powers off during boot and also just prior to the recovery console loading. If I boot into TGM it works fine. If I connect it to a bench power supply with an 85W Apple Magsafe 2 connector with everything connected to the logic board I get 1.75a. I hear the start up chime and the fan spins. Filevault was enabled so we get the logon screen, enter the PW to unlock the partition and part way through the progress indicator the Mac powers off and the power supply shows zero amps. If I disconnect and re connect the magsafe I get zero amps. It will then randomly power on and get to 1.75a again. If I try and boot into Internet recovery I connect ok to WiFi and the indicator counts down, when it loads the white screen with the Apple logo and about to show the macOS recovery it powers off and again the power supply shows zero amps\n\nI never see a light on the charger and I have tried more than one charger.\n\nAll of this is persistent.\n\nSo far this is what I have done.\n\nI have backed up via TGM.\nSMC and NVRAM Reset.\nI have disconnected the keyboard and the results are the same.\nI have disconnected the trackpad and the results are the same.\nI have removed the storage device and the results are the same, obviously just macOS recovery.\nI have disconnected the IO board and the results are the same.\nI have disconnected the battery and the results are the same.\nI have kept the charger disconnected and tried to get into recovery with just the battery connected and the results are the same.\n\nI have taken the Logic board and I/O board out and examined them under a microscope. There are no signs of liquid damage, no corrosion and the logic board is amazingly clean. I see no evidence that it has ever been dismantled until now. Some of the probe points are a bit discoloured but if I lightly scrape them the discolouration clears. There is a solder ball on <CAPACITOR>C9822</CAPACITOR>\n\nIf I place the logic board with just a single fan on the bench I can not create any issues. Same amperage and fan spin every time. Looking at Louis’ WIKI for this model I can not really see any troubleshooting steps that match my issue.\n\nAny suggestions would be well received. Thanks."

So its a Mid 2012 2.3Ghz 8Gb which means the Logic board is <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A . Would an issue with the FDMF6808N manifest itself the way I described ? I connected a Windows 10 Boot disk and held down option to boot from it, the Mac powers off. \n\nThanks\n\nBob"

I get 5v on pin 2 and 3 of <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> but nothing at all on L9000 and pins 28-30 of J9000. I am going to replace <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> but I am wondering what I should be seeing on Pin 1 of <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>? any ideas would be great please. Thank you."
