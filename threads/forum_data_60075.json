            "message": "This iMac was sent to me stating it stopped working after they attempted to upgrade the HDD to SSD. i believe i've found the issue but first want to confirm and second want to see if anyone know's what size the fuse is. See picture.\nI measured across and i'm getting what appears to be an open circuit, but that's as long as this is a fuse. (Note: This is my first iMac troubleshooting).\nSo, if this is a fuse, does anyone know what the Amp and volt rating? Theres no marking on it. Thanks"
