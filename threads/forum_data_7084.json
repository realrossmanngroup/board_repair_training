Fan now spins at full speed (at least its a step in the right direction). Problem is that it runs at full speed, and I now have no backlight\/display. no obvious damage to the board, all looks well around LED driver.  Is the U7400 related in some way to fan speed (like mouse issue) and\/backlight? No voltage at screen connector, no display or backlight on known good screens."}

You actually made it worse by changing U7400 cause now there is no CPU Vcore at all. When it did the 1\/4 fan spin it did have Vcore but was shutting down because of another issue."}
