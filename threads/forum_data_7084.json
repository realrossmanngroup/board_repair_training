Problem is that it runs at full speed, and I now have no backlight/display. no obvious damage to the board, all looks well around LED driver.  Is the <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> related in some way to fan speed (like mouse issue) and/backlight? No voltage at screen connector, no display or backlight on known good screens."
