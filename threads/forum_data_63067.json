When I connect the charger, I get a low battery sign on the screen, but that's about it, with or without the battery connected, I get the same battery low sign, and the unit will not power or go past that stage. One thing I have noticed is that PP3V3_S5 is not present, even when I get the low battery sign, this rail is not present, I am bent towards replacing U7800, but am not sure if that is a good troubleshooting cause of action. Please help."}
