            "message": "Good day, guys. \n\nI hope I get help with this one, this is new for me on this line, I have only encountered this issue on older designs pre-2018 Mac Line-Ups. When I connect the charger, I get a low battery sign on the screen, but that's about it, with or without the battery connected, I get the same battery low sign, and the unit will not power or go past that stage. One thing I have noticed is that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is not present, even when I get the low battery sign, this rail is not present, I am bent towards replacing <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>, but am not sure if that is a good troubleshooting cause of action. Please help."
