            "message": "Hi all\n\nI have a frustrating 3000$ fully specced problem on my hands and I need some experience shared to help me fix this problem.\n\nAbove mentioned MacBook came for EFI password removal that legit owned brought in, I've unlocked it and the owner was able to log in and all was good (friend - favor...). After 4-5 days he got back and wanted me to re install OS on it and after backing up and wiping SSD I rebooted it to a black screen. I got all major voltages:  5v, 3v3, G3HOT is (12v3), 1v05, 0.95 1V8 you name it.\n\nThe thing I am missing now is back light power enable signal. No USB activity and no picture on external monitor. All <SIGNAL>PM_SLP</SIGNAL> lines are present,<SIGNAL>CPU_PRWGOOD</SIGNAL> is 1V, CPU VCORE is 0V80 to 0V95 and only thing of \"concern\" is that south bridge is slightly warm to the touch ( i don't remember it being that way!) Also, laptop powers on and can be powered down via power button, battery is charging in normal fashion (20V, amperage varies)\nI can provide any relevant info as I am stuck with this board for months now, waiting for a spare board for parts. Board view and schematics are present and helpful. No water dmg, no physical dmg.  \n\nAny help, suggestion or hint is much appreciated. \n\nLet me just mention that I am not new in this type of work, just this model is a first one that I am working on so lack of experience is a factor - so I am reaching out for it (:\n\nThank you and I will really appreciate any help.\n\nRegards."
