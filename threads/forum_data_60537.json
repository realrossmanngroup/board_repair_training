Had a short on C7430 , replaced it and ppbus went up to 4v (from 0 ) \nnow the board is taking 23 mA and i am stuck :) pp3v42 is ok and i do have green and orange light .\nMeasured around the U7100 and pin 1 is 0 V , that cant be ok .... so traced back to R7185 and R7186 and they are up to specs .... The voltage there is probably not ok though , on pin 1 R7185 =18.51 and pin 2 =7.51V   and the R7186 pin 1 =7.51 and pin 2 = 0 V\n\nThe Q7180 \npin 1 and 2 = 18.51\npin 3 = 7.51\npin 4 and 5 = 17.95\npin 6 = 17.79\n\nif you had this board would you replace the isl or q7180 ? :)\n\nThanks in advance"}
