S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",

This needs a bunch S0 Rails to be created. But as <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> is missing on this board it is not in a S0 state.

Even if it it may be dead i could learn the troubleshooting process. \nIn the mean time i got another <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3476</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> in (i could fix this one and it still works fine). So i took all resistance measurements again from this working board, added the values to my sheet and uploaded it here. Only <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> are noticable lower than the values from the working board. So maybe this could be the last chance for this board..."

And only <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> makes sense here. So i replaced <CHIP>U8080</CHIP>. The diode mode readings did not change but the resistance readings came back up and - i could not belive it- the board turns on. So i dont know what to say at this ponit except thank you very much for your great help and patience.\nYou and this whole forum are amazing!!!"
