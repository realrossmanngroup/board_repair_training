        "message":"Hello,\nthis 820-3476 is not turning on. It has an orange light in the charger and there is no visible damage on the board.\nPP5V_S4 is not there because PM_SLP_S4_L is also missing. I checked U1900 and i ge a 1V p-p clock signal on pin 12 (on my oszilloskop) so i think this is fine.\nU1950 is missing ALL_SYS_PWRGD. Here it gets a bit confusing for me. As far as i understand PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK is needed for the CPU\/PCH to work. But this is created by ALL_SYS_PWRGD. This needs a bunch S0 Rails to be created. But as PM_SLP_S4_L is missing on this board it is not in a S0 state. So i am back to PM_SLP_S4_L not beeing created.\nWould be really great if somebode could give me a short explanation of how this works, what comes on first and help me fix this."

I slowly injected voltage in there (starting at 0.9 V - 3.5 V were enough to feel something getting hot) and U8300 got hot. I replced it. The short is gone now (0.377 V to GND in diode mode)  but still no PM_SLP_S4_L and still 0V on PP5V_S4 without pulsing. Also PPVRTC is still not pulsing. I checked ll other rails for shorts and two of the readings are a little low i think. \n\nPP1V35_S3_CPUDDR (and the other ram rails are similar) = 0.09V to GND in diode mode. This may still be ok because its a small circuit with low voltage on it...\nPPVCC_S0_CPU = 0.031V to GND in diode mode.
