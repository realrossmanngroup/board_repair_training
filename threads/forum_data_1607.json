        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. ."
