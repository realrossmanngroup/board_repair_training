CLeaned it up a bit looks pretty decent. Now it doesnt turn on but I have a pulse on L7520 and Enable on pin 4 of U7501, but missong 5V, 3.3 is present. Does that mean U6100 is working as I get the 5V signal and I have to look for another issue down the line?\n\nEdit: im missing 3V3_SUS on U6100, missing PP3V3_S4, I have 3.3v on U8000 but no enable signal"}
