        "820-00923": "What is 820-00923? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U3100": "What is U3100? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS": "What is PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS? PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS is 20v in from the USB-C charger on USB-C powered Macbook Pros..",
        "Q7030": "What is Q7030? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running.."

            "message": "Hi, first let me excuse me about my very bad english. \n\nI have a retina usb-c model coming from another store, had some liquid damage but i never see that cause the first place clean that. So, they replace some components randomly i pretend. \n\nWhen the machine comes to my store, in the usb-c meter was got nothing. I replace the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and restore the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>. From here, all is going well.\n\nIn the firsts attempts of the machine to turn on, used to get 19v and 0.22 amps in the usb-c meter and does not turns on. later on a 8th attempt i realized some part was getting so hot. that was <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/40. i get out those from the board, i measure all the pins of the <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/40 looking for some short to ground, and no have any short. so, i assume this components are bad. i replace those two, and at this time only the <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> got hot. But no have any short, i replace that again and have the same. \n\nLater same day, and now in the USB-C meter have 20v and 0.00 amps. I got some measures and i realized i have low PPBUS 1.6v i look for a short to ground and is not shorted. Looking for this rail i have noticed the <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> is missing. so, i have <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS</SIGNAL> but i don't know where look from now. \n\nThese types of machines are very confusing. \n\nI suspect the liquid was in the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> area, <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>, and <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>/200 Because the board looks in these areas.\n\nPlease, let me know where i must look or measure.\n\nthanks in advance."

(for a second, gets 19.9v and 0.003 Amps but just a sec).\nIn the <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> get 0.0070v in all pins and i measure in resistance mode too, get O.L.\nI change the <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>/40 because those two was getting hot and i try to take out of the board to measure and look for a short.\nI can reball that <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> but i dont think this have some crap in his pad cause this <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> have this black resin under the chip."
