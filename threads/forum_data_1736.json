After giving it a few minutes it's almost steady now, but the screen is displaying garbage vertical colored lines.  For the hell of it I put on another LCD and LVDS and that seems to be fine, so I guess the guy fried his LCD with the backlight over voltage."}

You can replace the entire assembly, or just the LCD, but fixing the LCD is a waste. i buy the cell for $85 and my receptionist can replace it in a half hour."}
