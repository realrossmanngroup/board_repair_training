        "message":"Hi,\n\nI have a 820-3115 with no backlight. There is a short to ground on PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT. I have removed all four caps, connector and LED Driver but the short is still present. I put voltage to the board and the heat seems to be evenly spread over the line and hottest wherever I connect the wire.\n\nDo you have any idea what else would be causing the short?\n\nThanks"

The actual capacitor was fine when I took it off but just next to it was burnt a little and was shorting to ground with the solder pad of the capacitor. I scratched a bit of the pad away and the short has now gone. Annoyingly that was the first component I removed and have to put everything back on again now!"
