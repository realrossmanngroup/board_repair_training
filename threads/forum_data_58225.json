        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

This one  already works but backlight appear slowly and with DIM backlight like photo show.  \n\nAlready replace <CHIP>U9701</CHIP>, <DIODE>D9701</DIODE>, <RESISTOR>R9840</RESISTOR>, fix trace <SIGNAL>PIN_24</SIGNAL> _U9701 to <SIGNAL>PIN1_C9796</SIGNAL>. \n\nLCD connector looks well and already did 3 PRAM. \n\nAny suggestion ? \n\nthanks"
