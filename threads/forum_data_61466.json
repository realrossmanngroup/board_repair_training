I had the same result, can't log in. restarts, it still feels really hot as well - I'm guessing it's hitting over critical temp and restarting. \n\nApplied new thermal paste (old stuff was dry as) still same issue. \n\nI am noticing fans are changing speed once, they are just going normal boot up speed. \n\nBoth fans are operating but obviously something is going on temperature wise. \n\nPlease help :) \n\nThanks"}
