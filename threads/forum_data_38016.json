        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

I'm guessing there must've been some corrosion under the CPU after all.\nCPU Vcore is now 1.7V, all other rails I was missing before (<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>) are back up. No gong or image on screen (internal or external). NVRAM reset doesnt seem to do anything, but it will shut off when holding the power button.\nUSB mouse light is flashing when connected. Still a borked CPU?"
