Getting consistent full fan spin now. I'm guessing there must've been some corrosion under the CPU after all.\nCPU Vcore is now 1.7V, all other rails I was missing before (ALL_SYS_PWRGD) are back up. No gong or image on screen (internal or external). NVRAM reset doesnt seem to do anything, but it will shut off when holding the power button.\nUSB mouse light is flashing when connected. Still a borked CPU?"}

I've had a few like that on the 3330 cured with a mild PCH reflow with some flux, but wouldn't try that on the wimpy CPUs here."}

I'm giving up on this one, looks like its a problem under the CPU and I cant fix that."}
