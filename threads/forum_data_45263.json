Flux on <CAPACITOR>C1683</CAPACITOR> <CAPACITOR>C1681</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C1680</CAPACITOR>, they were also soldered backwards. CPU also has flux under it but does not look pop corned. When turns on it beeps 3 times and then turns off. Tried good known ram, one at a time each slot. CPU vcore starts at 1.1v, and remains at 1.1V until board powers off.\n\nSo far just replaced <CAPACITOR>C1683</CAPACITOR> <CAPACITOR>C1681</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C1680</CAPACITOR> and soldered them in correct position. What to check next or does this sound unfixable from prior idiot?"

When powered up now the fan spins and it beeps once every few seconds with or without ram and cpu core stays at a steady 1.1V.
