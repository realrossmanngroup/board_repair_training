Unfortunately my colleague went ahead and reflowed the GPU to diagnose this board before we spotted that this is notorious board for C9560 problem. Now we have an image but question is did a temporary fix to GPU or to a cap? Is there a way to check it before we replace both?\n\nThanks!"}

That is why I am not jumping straight to GPU replacement on this one. No chime on boot and no image only fan spin. NVRAM reset doesnt work. This morning I was able to boot it again but it crashed in Furmark immediately."}
