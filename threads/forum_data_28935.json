Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics.

Unfortunately my colleague went ahead and reflowed the GPU to diagnose this board before we spotted that this is notorious board for <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> problem. Now we have an image but question is did a temporary fix to GPU or to a cap? Is there a way to check it before we replace both?\n\nThanks!"
