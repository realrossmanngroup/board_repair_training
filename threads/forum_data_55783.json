        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",

Cleaned, replaced <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R7537</RESISTOR> <CAPACITOR>C7537</CAPACITOR> <CAPACITOR>C7536</CAPACITOR> that were burnt. Now seems that i am getting all reail ok but dont getting ALL SYS GOOD. \n\n\nCHecked and seems that board tries to enter S0 state once connect adapter. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> is 1.7V and <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> 0 V.  As i see i will not get sys good while <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is not activated. \n\n\nBad <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> ??? ALready replaced it twice."
