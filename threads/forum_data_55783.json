        "message":"Hi, \n\nLogic board was water damaged in U7501 area. Cleaned, replaced U7501 and R7537 C7537 C7536 that were burnt. Now seems that i am getting all reail ok but dont getting ALL SYS GOOD. \n\n\nCHecked and seems that board tries to enter S0 state once connect adapter. PP3V3_S0 is 1.7V and PP5V_S0 0 V.  As i see i will not get sys good while PP5V_S0 is not activated. \n\n\nBad U7501 ??? ALready replaced it twice."
