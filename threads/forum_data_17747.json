I usually just use boot camp and keep the OSX partition relatively small and set it to boot from windows as the standard start disk. Then I always got the Mac OS available for trouble shooting when they have issues. They loose about 30GB hard drive capacity but that's the trade-off.\n\nThe 20-inch 2008-2009 iMacs only support 32 bit Windows 7."}
