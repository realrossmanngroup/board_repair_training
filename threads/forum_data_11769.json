No obvious liquid damage spotted. So far I have checked if 3.42 makes it to the SMC it seems ok (measured 3.49 though). What more should i check?\n\nEDIT: No light on USB mouse"}

Will try to reflow the GPU see if I can get it working like that. And check CPU V-Core as well. Since it is an 15 inch might very well be the GPU."}
