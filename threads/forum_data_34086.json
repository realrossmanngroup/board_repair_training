Now does not want to turn on (quarter fan spin orange then green then orange light). Tried disconnecting battery and still the same. Reflowed SMC - same. Replaced R7121 and R7122 as they were reading 100ohms instead of 10. Replaced U6100, U5110 and C5101 and still nothing. Wasted half of my day on this. Any ideas? Would appreciate it. P.S. tried a different dc-in board already"}

Guess it's just a short in one of the rails. Thank you for trying anyways."}
