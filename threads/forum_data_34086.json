When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

Now does not want to turn on (quarter fan spin orange then green then orange light). Tried disconnecting battery and still the same. Reflowed SMC - same. Replaced <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR> as they were reading 100ohms instead of 10. Replaced <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>, <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C5101</CAPACITOR> and still nothing. Wasted half of my day on this. Any ideas? Would appreciate it. P.S. tried a different dc-in board already"

Guess it's just a short in one of the rails. Thank you for trying anyways."
