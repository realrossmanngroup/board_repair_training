        "message":"I'm working on 820-00165 board, which came to me with description: \"Turned off by itself, after a while turned on, but SSD wasn't detected. Now has no reaction for charger\". \n\nMy observations:\n\n- board is clean, no corrosion, no water damage, no mechanical damage.\n- there is no green light when charger plugged in\n- I have discovered, that PP3V42_G3H is missing and has  low reading - 0,007V to ground in diode mode. After further inspection I found out, that short is caused by SMC itself. I have removed SMC and replaced it with one from the same board. PP3V42_G3H is back now, I have green then orange light on charger, but no fan spin. \n\nOther measurements: \n\n- PPBUS_G3H - 8,57V\n- PP3V42_G3H - 3,42V\n- PP3V3_S5 - 3,35V\n- PP5V_S5 - 5,12V\n- PPVRTC_G3H - 3,31V\n- [B]PP5V_S4RS3 - 0V (0,390V to ground)[\/B]\n-[B] PP3V3_SUS - 0V (0,390V to ground)\n -PP3V3_SUS_EN - 0V (0,495V to ground)\n- PM_SLP_SUS_L - 0V [B](not pulsing)[\/B]\n- PM_SLP_S4_L - 0V (not pulsing)[\/B]\n\nI already have tried another SMC from 820-00165 board, but it behaves the same."
