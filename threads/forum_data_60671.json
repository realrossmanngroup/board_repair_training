        "message":"Hello everybody :-)\n\nI'm currently working on a MBP (820-01987) with some corrosion around C6406 with pulsing PP3V3_G3H.\nIt is taking 20V and pulsing 15mA to 22mA.\n\nI don't see any obvios liquid damage on U7650, but I think this could cause the pulsing PP3V3_G3H? It's pretty close to C6406 and could be damaged too?\n\nI am a bit cautious since it is a very new device - so I prefer to ask here first :) \nBest regars\n\nLucas"
