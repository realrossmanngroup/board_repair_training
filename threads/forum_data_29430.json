The backlight circuit which was hit the hardest with the corrosion is know a problem. The LVDS was replaced due to it missing legs. The LED backlight drive has been replaced as well as all the surrounding resistors (nasty looking) The through hole via for the LCDBKLT_PWR_SW had to be rebuilt, the feed back circuit is intact, I am not getting BKL_PWM (0v). I have tried PRAM resetting it SMC lid is 3.4v and I get 12.56v to the LVDS connector pin 21."}
