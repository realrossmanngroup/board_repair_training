Someone replacing the battery and shorting pins? Water? Out of nowhere?\n\nThere are four items in this circuit. The battery, the U7000, the SMC, and the battery indicator\/sleep sensor\/LED thingie on the side.\n\nYou replaced the U7000. Unplug the sleep sensor\/battery indicator thingie. Does it see the battery?\n\nIf not, try good battery.\n\nDoes it still not see a battery?\n\nIf it doesn't, at this point, it is the SMC.\n\nBut give some better history."}

No shorts to ground on battery pins apart from the 3 ground pins which i suppose are meant to be that way . on the smc line resistors the voltages are 3.4 volts and on f7040 the voltage is between 17-18 volts which i suppose should be less . \n\nplease look at the attached pics ,  I found these solder blobs but they are not shorting anywhere until there is a track here which goes to smc but i doubt that .  Machine is not even slow . this one is proving to be difficult and beyond logic .\n i have cleaned the solder blobs and replaced the q7030 ,  changed the caps around q7030 . No idea but do not want to give up ."}

Battery detection will probably be 6259 or SMC.\nIf you remove the 6259 it should still work on the battery if it is recognized."}

As there is no short on smc data lines i think smc itself is faulty but  finding a working smc from another board and replacing it is a torture ."}

Also i need to replace smc on a1466 but do no have the same board as donor . so kindly advise as which smc's are compatible . thanks"}
