Unplug the sleep sensor/battery indicator thingie.

No shorts to ground on battery pins apart from the 3 ground pins which i suppose are meant to be that way . on the smc line resistors the voltages are 3.4 volts and on f7040 the voltage is between 17-18 volts which i suppose should be less . \n\nplease look at the attached pics ,  I found these solder blobs but they are not shorting anywhere until there is a track here which goes to smc but i doubt that .  Machine is not even slow . this one is proving to be difficult and beyond logic .\n i have cleaned the solder blobs and replaced the <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> ,  changed the caps around <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> . No idea but do not want to give up ."
