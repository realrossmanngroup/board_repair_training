Also there is slight ticking noise from the board, but cant pinpoint the location.\n\nTried with both disconnected trackpad only and cable from the board to KBD/Tpad.\n\nWhich voltages should I report?\nCoil voltage seems ok apart than these, which seem missing (or inaccurate?):\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_CPU_PH1</SIGNAL> - 0V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_CPU_PH2</SIGNAL> - 0V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_CPU_PH3</SIGNAL> - 0V\n<SIGNAL>VCCINAUX_SW</SIGNAL> - 1.81V"
