        "message":"Hi thanks, many places over the board.\nI trawled through many posts looking for a link to known good bios dumps for this specific board and couldnt find any.I replaced so far u7200 corroded and no cpu vcore before replacement, C102 was short, U1950 had .5v on pin3 before changing it, Spillage under Smc so reballed it (Might replace it and see if it helps). U7400 had corrosion and broken trace on it so replaced and fixed trace.\n\nFirst symptom was 19ma no charger led so current situation is 150ma, fan spin No Usb activity.\nAll spi resistors checked ok.\nWill try one of those bios files .\nDo you think there is any point in replacing the Smc? I had a 00165-a recently with something a bit similar and I replaced the Smc and it worked.\n\nAll diode reading\nL7320 - .0319\nL7310 - .0314\nL7630 - .099\nL7430 - .136\nL7560 - .352\nL7520 - .418\nL7130 - .143\nL3095 - .476\nL7701 - .418\n\ntried those dumps but still the same."

Is it possible there is a short somewhere? as there was slight liquid damaged on the underside of Cpu that was short cap c1204 which I replaced at start of troubleshooting.\n\nThanks for your time and input , it is much appreciated."
