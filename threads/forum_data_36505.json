Also cannot boot to recovery.\n\nI have already tried another BIOS from a known working board for testing.\n\nI am aware that this will most likely show signs of a bad GPU at some point but would still like to know what this issue could be.\n\nThanks. Have a good one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate - Resolved. Thanks anyway. have a good one."
