They already UCed with generic chinese bath.\n\nI did once more with Crest to clear their flux (which was all over the place) and also ensure a better bath and after that I jumped a corroded line and a missing resistor BOTH next to the SMC.\n\nNow when I connect the magsafe the fan starts, I get ALL_SYS_PWRGD but no green light..\n\nPPBUS_G3H at F7140 is 8.3 to 8.4V\nPP3V42_G3H at 3.45V\nSMC_BC_ACOK is also HIGH\n\nother voltages present too..\n\nAny ideas?\n\nbr,\ngeorge"}
