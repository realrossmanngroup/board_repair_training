So usb meter was sticking at 5v with 32amps when i started. Noticed corrosion on CB300 which is PP3v3_G3H. Removed that cap and now I get 20v (sometimes at 1.4 amps, sometimes at 14amps or sometimes at 5 amps.\n\nPPDCIN_G3H is missing\nPP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS is missing\n\nDo you think it is CD3215 chips?\n\nPPBUS_G3H is 1v"}
