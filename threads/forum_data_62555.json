        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",

        "R7112": "What is R7112? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",

            "message": "Okay, new development. When I tried with the 85w MagSafe, it actually came on. I am having problems now though with the keyboard and trackpad not working. Also the battery is charged up, but the computer will only power on with the Magsafe. I can now use the 60w Magsafe now every time.\nI do have a new keyboard and trackpad cable. I replaced both of these, and this did not work. The power button does work because I am able to power off the computer holding it down for several seconds. When I tested the trackpad and keyboard on another palm rest I had in stock with the keyboard and mouse, the external display was not sending any kind of signal through the mini display port. So external video is not working, but I hear it doing the chime. I then tested with an external keyboard and mouse, and both of these work (boots up to the customers name/login screen). I am thinking this is all relating back to a sensor issue? A bit more history on this Mac, and it originally had a lot of heat damage inside, meaning a lot of the parts that I would normally unplug, some had cracked or broke (plastic) from the heat over the years, which I had to replace, even the keyboard was replaced. Why the problem with the computer not turning on from the battery, and trackpad/keyboard is not working? Am I not getting enough power from something?"
