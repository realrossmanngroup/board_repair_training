I measured around and <SIGNAL>BLK_EN</SIGNAL> is only 3.0V. I chekhed the voltage divider (both resistors are fine) and came to <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. It is only 12.22V. I can clearly see it working on the screen and i can use it with an external monitor. Everything else works fine. I tried a different screen and still no light. I already exchanged <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R9731</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R9715</RESISTOR> to be sure but still the same measurements. Can this be a SMC problem if <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is stuck at 12.22V even if everything else works?"
