Ran diode mode on both touch bar connectors and compared to a know good board. found a I had a broken line to pin 20 and 21 on J4402 for the touch bar ran yet another jumper but still getting error. Testing with a known good display and top case and USB OS. SSD can be accessed with lifeboat in place."
