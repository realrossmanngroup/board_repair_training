            "message": "Hello all,\nI have loved watching the youtube channel and have had a fun time tinkering my self on some macbooks.\nTo cut to the chase, I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that came in because it was not charging the battery. After opening up the system, I found some nice sugary mess on the back side of the board in the <CAPACITOR>C1047</CAPACITOR> area. I also found A LOT of happy little solder balls sneaking out of many caps for the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS</SIGNAL> areas (pretty much every cap on the CPU side of the board except for <CAPACITOR>C7130</CAPACITOR>-31 and a few in that area.\n\nAfter gently cleaning with a toothbrush (I mean gentle - I didn't want to become a statistic that Louis talks about so much) the board no longer powered on... Great.\n\nSo I got to the trouble shooting. Had no G3H. Ended up replacing all the bad looking caps due to the escaping solder balls - Still no solution, Changed charger in board - no change. Swapped back old board and FM - it worked again. So I cleaned the connectors of that flex cable some more and no more problems with the onewire. Now I was back to the original problem of the battery was saying it was 0% and only working on the wall power.\n\nDid some trouble shooting, replaced a few components/voltage rectifiers that the caps could have damaged due to heat, checked the feedback resistors, change them cause I wanted to be sure. Finally swapped out <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> - still same problem. I had dropped the new <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> before installing it so said, ok, lets try again. Swapped with another new one and battery was reading that it was charging/full.\n\nRan ASD and found a bad sensor in the battery pack (-27degrees on one of them) Just installed a new battery now.\n\nSO, where I am at is, after installing a new battery, plugging in the charger displays the orange charging light, but the computer says 100%, unplug the charger and the battery jumps to about 93% Is this a battery calibration problem? I don't think so personally.\n\nOther thing to note/question.\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> is 15.10v on pin 1 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> (inrush limiter) and 14.57v on the output pin 4 (originally this was not getting its signal from <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> to open)\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> has the same 14.57v on pin 2 but only 8.18v on pin 7. Well below the 8.6 listed in the schematic.\n\nI have a feeling this is the problem as only 8.18v is going out to charge the battery max? Or is the sense circuit doing its job and thats all the 7.3v battery needs to max charge?\n\nIf this is a battery calibration thing, I'm all ears! This is my first battery swap for a macbook and wont be my last.\n\nHave a great day and sorry for the mess of a post."

System still says Battery is Charged. Possibly a current sensing problem?"

            "message": "Thank Gurmon, I did mention I installed a new battery. I tested 2 new batteries actually, same problem.\nSo, I made a rokie mistake and somehow, after testing the current sensing circuit about 10 times - <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR> was sitting at a comfortable 30.2ohms... No beno, Changed it out again with a brand spankin new 10ohm 5% and still was not getting charge. Everything looked good outside the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, current sense circuits, battery was comunicating with SMC, other variouse components for charging, so my gut told me 3rd time is the charm.\n\nChanged out <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> again, and now all is happy. Seems the brain is the best tool :)\n\nI am charging the system now and finally got that happy green light I have been wanting.\n\n\nBy the way, is that 15.2v and 8.2v normal for the air? Its quite different from the schematics and I haven't opened any others up yet. Also, any input on the balls flowing out from under the caps?\n\nCheers\n\nI guess this could be a case closed, but would love to hear some feed back about those 3 questions I have."

The SMC(<CHIP>U5000</CHIP>) talks to the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>(<CHIP>U7100</CHIP>) on an SMBUS line that can be pulled down by a bad battery, bad <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>, or a bad SMC, and tells the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> at some point to go up to 8.5v. If this were the case that <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> were 8.1v I doubt the machine would be charging or even [I]seeing [/I]a battery at all.\n\nRandom solder balls around capacitors is no good.

I probably burned it while changing out that <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> because I am still learning the techniques.  The system passed all the tests I could throw at it before it left my door and the client has been very happy with the repair.\n\nThanks"
