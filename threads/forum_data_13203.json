            "message": "Hey gang,  not too confident yet about what part to buy.  The part is VCC <CHIP>U7940</CHIP> 74AUP1G3208 SOT891 \nThere is a pic below so you don't have to open a schematic. \nHere is what I have found on mouser.com [URL=\"http://www.mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=74AUP1G3208\"]http://www.mouser.com/Search/Refine....rd=74AUP1G3208[/URL].\nI'm just a little hesitant to pull the trigger.  \nDoes it need to be 74AUP (don't know what that is) , I know the size has to be SOT891 (SIZE), what I'm unsure of is the 74AUP vs AUP on that page. The only thing in stock is just AUP.  \nAny help much appreciated. Also is there a way to search other board schematics for this part and see if I can salvage?"
