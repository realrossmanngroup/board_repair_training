        "820-3023": "What is 820-3023? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1800": "What is U1800? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "5V_S0": "What is 5V_S0? 5V_S5 is an abbreviation for “PP5V_S0”.",
        "3V3_S0": "What is 3V3_S0? Abbreviation for PP3V3_S0, a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S0 working state.",
        "PPVCORE_S0_AXG": "What is PPVCORE_S0_AXG? This is vcore going to the CPU’s integrated graphics processor for CPUs that have an integrated GPU. When this is missing on a device that has an integrated GPU and no discrete GPU, it usually means either no screen is detected, or the GPU integrated into the CPU is dead..",

        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."
