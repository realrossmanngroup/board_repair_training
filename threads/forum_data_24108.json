        "message":"This board was said to have liquid damage but I can't find much of any except for a little on the I\/O Board. There are discolored probe points in places but I don't see any corrosion anywhere.\n\nAnyways, the fans turn on when the charger is plugged in but nothing appears on the screen and there is no vcore. I do feel the U1800 chip get slightly warm so I think the PCH is working. \nPPBUS_G3H, PPVRTC_G3H, 5V_S0, 3v3_s0 and ALLSYS_PWRGD were all present.\n\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU and PPVCORE_S0_AXG show 0v but PP1V5_S3_CPU_VCCDQ, PP1V05_S0_CPU_VCCPQE, and PP1V8_S0_CPU_VCCPLL_R all had the correct voltage on them.\n\nI'm not sure exactly where to start in troubleshooting vcore on this model."
