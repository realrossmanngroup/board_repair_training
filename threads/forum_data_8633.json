        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "P5VS4RS3_EN": "What is P5VS4RS3_EN? PP5VS4RS3_EN is a signal that enables the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail. When you see _EN in front of a signal name, it means that it is enabling whatever comes before the _EN when the signal is high..",
        "S5_PWR_EN": "What is S5_PWR_EN? S5_PWR_EN is a signal that turns on all S5 power rails when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

The fan starts spinning max and does not switch of anymore. CPU VCore is at 1.739v. The USB can power an external drive, but mouse doesnt light up.\n\nEdit: could it be current sensing issue?"
