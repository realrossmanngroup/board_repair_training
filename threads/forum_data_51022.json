After putting password it becomes extremly slow and fans begins to spin high speed. Checked motherboard and there is nothing strange on it. No water damage, nothing. Also Power rails seems to be ok. \n\nAfter AHT it says that the computer may have power managment issue. Anyone faced similar things? I suspect it may be trackpad or some flex but actualy dont have new one to check it. \n\n\nAny idea?"
