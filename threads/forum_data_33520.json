Most of the liquid was maybe around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>.\n\nIt turns on and gives me an green light, no orange and runs off the battery no problem. Can also turn on/off when just on battery.\n\n<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>::17/18 & 27/28 measure as expected.\n\n<RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR> are in spec and show 3.4v"
