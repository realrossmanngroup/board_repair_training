All power rails are present and the machine is turning on. Signs of liquid damage however extremely minimal and have nothing to do with any critical components. \n\nFans spin, all main power rails are normal, I get USB light however no activity, and I get a Thunderbolt to HDMI signal output, that outputs a display signal, but its blank, black screen. CPU gets warm, but like a normal warm, same with GPU. Fans spin from normal then to max.\n\nI started measuring U6100, as most likely this was the culprit. I noticed SPIROM_HOLD_L, SPI_MLB_CS_L, and SPIROM_WP_L, are all 3.3V SPI MOSI and CLK are both 0V, and MISO is at 1.7V, but also goes to 3.3V after a little bit.\n\nIve looked this up, and theres only 1 post about an issue like this, and they mentioned SMC_TCK, TDI, TDO, and TMS all being 3.3V, which is the case here as well.\n\nI removed U6100 just to see what would happen and all _L voltages are still 3.3V, however and CLK, and MOSI are still 0V, but MISO is a solid 3.3V.\n\nIm just really confused at this point"}
