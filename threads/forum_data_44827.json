        "message":"This board had some minor liquid-damage. Computer works fine and charges the battery fine but if you unplug it, it can't start or run on battery. PPBUS is staying fine at 8.4V on R7006. Q5500 circuit seems to be working normally compared to a good board. R7151 and R7152 are both fine. U7100 area is clean. I added pre-ultrasonic cleaning pictures. Not sure if this is an SMC communication issue or something else. It's obviously communicating enough to charge so I'm guessing that part is fine but I'm not sure what would cause this."
