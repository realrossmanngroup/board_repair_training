        "R7151": "What is R7151? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

PPBUS is staying fine at 8.4V on <RESISTOR>R7006</RESISTOR>. <TRANSISTOR>Q5500</TRANSISTOR> circuit seems to be working normally compared to a good board. <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR> are both fine. <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> area is clean. I added pre-ultrasonic cleaning pictures. Not sure if this is an SMC communication issue or something else.
