If so, what's the best procedure for replacing <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C9510</CAPACITOR>? The space to fit a proper poly-film cap is basically non-existent. What's the best way to cram proper caps in there without causing any issues? I have a few 2849 boards that seem to be having similar GPU power circuit issues, and I didn't see too much on here with regards to tantalum cap failure on the 2849 (relative to the 2850).\n\nThanks in advance as always."
