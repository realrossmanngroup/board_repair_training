        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

            "message": "This macbook had a short in the board neard <DIODE>D7701</DIODE>, and the backlight driver feedback line was burned away.\n\nI drilled a hole until the short to ground was gone, replaced the fuse and backlight driver, and ran a wire to replace the <SIGNAL>LCDBKL_FB</SIGNAL> line to the backlight driver.\n\nBacklight works, laptop boots, and the fuse does not blow. However, the backlight no longer adjusts normally. Flickers between settings instead of fading, and the backlight turns off halfway down the on screen display's scale.\n\nAny thoughts? Crappy backlight driver soldering? Or <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> issue? \n\nThanks."
