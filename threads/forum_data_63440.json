Customer brought it after another shop repair attempt. The board had minor oxidation around jtag port and J8300.\n\nR8317, R8318 and C8302 were knocked off. After replacing them I'm still missing some voltages:\n\n[I]MEASUREMENTS[\/I]\n[B]J8300[\/B]\nPin1 : 0V\nPin2 : 0V\nPin3 : 5V\nPin4 : 5V\nPin5 : 3.3V\nPin6 : 3.3V\nPin7 : 3.3V\nPin8 : 3.3V\nPin9 : 0V\nPin10 : 0V\nPin11 : 0V\nPin12 : 3V\nPin13 -> Pin30 : 0V\n\n[B]L8300[\/B]\n5V on both ends\n\n[B]U7700[\/B]\nPin0 : 0V\nPin5 : 5V\n[I]diode mode[\/I]\npin15 : 0.5\npin16 : 0.5[I][\/I]\n\n[B]U8330[\/B]\nPin1 : 0V\nPin8 : 3.3V\n\n[B]U8340[\/B]\npin1 : 0V\nPin5 : 3.3V\n\nDon't know where else to look but it seems that U7700 can't get enabled.\n\nthanks for your support\n\nAnd have a great 2023 !!"}
