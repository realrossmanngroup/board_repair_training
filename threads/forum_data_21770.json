        "message":"Well I have a client who took his mid 2015 MBP to the \"genius\" bar and they said nothing was wrong with it.  After he brought it home he did a clean install and it would just keep rebooting.  I booted it from a good OS and same issue.  Then I did a PRAM and SMC reset and now it boots the the 3 Beeps 5 second pause. (Bad Ram)  any suggestions?  Does Louis do BGA RAM replacement?  Thx"
