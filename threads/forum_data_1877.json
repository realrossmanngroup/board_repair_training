            "message": "Kinda stumped on where to go with this one.. Missing <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> and the SMC area is getting really warm (and is shorted), however I do indeed have <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and a green light on the charger. I have gone back to the S5 enables and found 1.2v on pin 6 of <CHIP>U7941</CHIP> (supposed to be <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>)... I've also discovered I have 3.4v on pins 1,2 and 3 (but nothing in this area is shorted).. My assumption based on how fucked the area near the SMC looked is that the problem is in that area (image attached). All caps on that line are shorted and 2 have been removed because they were completely black and burned.. any help on how to go about repairing this?"
