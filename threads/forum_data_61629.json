This was using genuine 85w cable. I ran the board through an ultrasonic after this to remove the flux and gunk from the repair (my machine isn't frequency sweepable but I move the board around every 10-15s and I've never had this machine itself kill a board before) and after the clean and dry I get no green light and the machine pulls 45mA from the charger. Checked PPBUS and found it to be 0.45v, also checked and it seems to be shorted to ground. CPU coils have 12ohms resistance, so is it safe to assume the CPU is still ok and I can go hunting for this short using voltage injection?"}
