I have a problem with this iMac, it constantly turns on, starts loading system and then restarts with message \"computer restarted because of an problem)\". I'm not able to enter boot menu or diagnostics or safe mode. Tried other RAM or SSD - no results. Customer states, that authorised shop diagnosed HDD problem, but I really doubt.."

            "message": "There is a big difference in iMac behaviour with this BIOS. It chimes, lets enter to boot menu, but doesn't see internal SSD. It detects external drives and OS installers, but doesn't boot to them, keeps restarting while loading, but after restart there is no message about problem. Can I ask you to clean ME region of my BIOS? or in BIOS that you have sent me? I can do it manually, but it takes so much longer than using Medusa. \n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EkymeKmEhyQhs6QT89oPsV1Lo7hsyjD/view?usp=sharing[/URL]"
