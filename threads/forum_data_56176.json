            "message": "Received an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> 2016 touchbar 15\" in yesterday (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00281</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> / 661-06279) with a stange fault. Customer states they dropped the Mac and afterwards it wouldn't power up - can confirm there is a big dent on the corner of the housing.\nI've opened it up pulled the battery and then reconnected - when I connect the charger the fans start spinning and the machine powers up - i see the apple logo load up to half way then the screen goes black but the touchbar remains lit and caps lock reacts when I press it on and off. Also if I press keys it's making the invalid operation noise. If I attempt to force power down the machine at this point it doesn't react - holding power button down for 15 seconds and nothing machine stays on.\nI've disconnected the battery again and done some more digging around - observed the left option key was jammed down with something so have pulled the keycap and removed the offending dirt from there - tried booting again only this time it starts up normally takes me to the login screen no problem at all. Use it for a bit - checked all keys on keyboard working no problems there wifi, bluetooth all functioning as is screen. Shut it down, power it up again a few times - again no issue starts normally so i think great it's just the sticky option key which caused the issue and I replace the bottom case and try to power it up again - it's now behaving in the same way it was originally - it gives me half a loading screen and then blank and will happily sit there ignoring my key presses for SMC Reset, PRAM reset and won't power off with the power button.\nI've done some more to try to get it back on again - disconnected and replug battery a few times and have now managed to get it back on again - currently backing up the customers data in case the board is toast.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this issue and what to check for - one of my thoughts would be perhaps there's a faulty lid sensor somewhere but this board doesn't want to power up at all unless everything is connected which makes diagnosing this pretty difficult!"

            "message": "It appears to react with usb mouse when it's on it's own without anything else connected. \nJust as an update with more testing I did - after taking customers data off i've left it in a normal open position but off for the whole weekend turned back on and then off no problems shutting down or starting back up. Done this maybe 15-20 times - then after shutting down I closed the lid and reopened - nothing no response at all macbook sits there and won't power up at all no fan spin nothing.\n\nAfter pulling the battery again and then leaving it in an open position and plugging the battery back in - i've also connected an external display to try to do further diagnosis, started up normally both displays working - i then closed and reopened the lid - internal display went off but external remained on. I've then checked <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> at <CAPACITOR>C4490</CAPACITOR> which is reading 3.40v when the lid is open and 0.0v when closed. I've then gone into the display preferences and it can't see the internal display any more. \n\nNow my thoughts are pointing towards maybe the good old crap screen cable problem on the touchbar models with a data line which isn't talking properly back to the SMC from the screen. Any other thoughts - unit was working perfectly on external but won't power on again now after shutting down - power button presses are ignored, as is shorting <SIGNAL>SMC_ON_OFF_L</SIGNAL> to ground - can confirm it drops from 3.40v to 0.00v on power button press however. Also with the internal display completely disconnected it will consistently power up upon application of the charger cable when it's plugged to an external display."
