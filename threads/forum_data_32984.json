I tracked down that <SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_FUSE</SIGNAL> is missing (it starts at 1.27v and slowly increases til 1.5ish). I can't understand how the 18v gets activated from the charger, is that via the <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> line / <CHIP>U6900</CHIP>? I'm using an 85watt charger and the DC-in jack works on the donor board I have.\n\n* Fuse F6905 is shorted just fine.\n* <RESISTOR>R6920</RESISTOR> is 47Ohm (as expected)\n* <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> is 10Ohm(as expected)\n\nResistance <SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_FUSE</SIGNAL> to GND starts at 8k and slowly increases until 40k or so\n\nThanks! Sorry if this is a noob question."

Looks like something is pulling the 3.2v from the charger to be 1v. I just need to find whats pulling it down.\n\n\nEDIT:\nI got 18v!! Just for future reference, read this on how the magsafe process works. Make sure you have 68k load resistor otherwise charger wont send out 18k.\n[URL=\"http://www.righto.com/2013/06/teardown-and-exploration-of-magsafe.html\"]http://www.righto.com/2013/06/teardo...f-magsafe.html[/URL]\n\nPlease mark this one as solved."
