I go look at it and I see the hard drive light is on but no life on the macbook as if its just restarting losing power and repeating.\n\ni take it open it up and i dont see any obvious damage i pop it into the ultrasonic make sure its clean and it fixed the issue for a day.\n\nnow the mac will turn on and chime but wont stay on more than a second or 2 after just complete shut off.\n\ni tried unplugging everything but same issue.. could this be bad smc?"}

How can i tell if im in smc bypass mode?\n\nwell i think it was a power button issue. Maybe it was stuck somehow after pressing it various times the issue seems to have stopped..\n\nwell it came back again.."}
