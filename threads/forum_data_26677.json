        "message":"This board worked fine initially but then the screen went black while I was using it. It seemed like the processor lost power. The computer had so signs of life besides a spinning fan. After testing it, the CPU is actually getting power (1.75V). With the board out I can see that the fan comes up for a second, dies down and then spins back up and stays spinning, kind of like the 3437 boards. But that's it - no post, no boot. I was convinced this was going to be a CPU issue. I'm not sure now which part of the board would fail but still allow the board to spin up. Any thoughts? I attached pre-cleaning pics. It looks like the main area hit was around U1900, Y1905, the top right part of the SMC where the 3V42 lines are and some near J6100 (now removed) on the other side of the board. I replaced all visibly damaged components in those areas and made sure pads were clean underneath anything not replaced."
