        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",

        "R7151": "What is R7151? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

The battery will not charge and the computer will not run off battery. If loaded into the OS, it says \"your battery needs to be replaced\". I replaced the battery, now it just says no battery is installed (but it still gives the battery percentage at 52%!). I don't think it is the battery in this case. The charger shows green then orange.\n\n<SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL</SIGNAL> : Shows activity (also checked for connection to J6950, is fine)\n<SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA</SIGNAL> : Shows activity (also checked for connection to J6950, is fine)\n<SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CONN</SIGNAL> : Initially shows around 3V - 4V, but then drops to 0V after around 20 seconds\n<SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_L</SIGNAL>: 0.33V\n\n\nNot sure what else to try. Other than the battery, when plugged into AC it works fine.\n\nMy only thought is with the <CHIP>U5000</CHIP> or <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, but visually - they seem fine."

Second question would be to connect the old battery again and check what OSX says about the status/cycle count/etc.\n\nMy suspicion is you have 2 bad batteries. These machines need A1496 battery model!"
