        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "R7050": "What is R7050? Current sense shunt resistor for the battery, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 17/18 on ISL6259 should give you 2.02 ohms. .",
        "D7050": "What is D7050? Diodes between SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL and ground, these data lines allow the battery to communicate with the battery charging chip and the SMC..",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present."

            "message": "The computer stopped charging properly after I start using Oracle Virtual Box with heavy configuration, I guess something somewhere overheated. Initially the problem was that the battery was not charging even though the mac works fine using the charger only, without the battery. Since the status of the battery was \"replace soon\", I purchased a new one. The new one was not charging as well, so I guess the problem is in the board. I took the mac to a \"friend\" who works with iphones only, but  he said he \"could handle this problem\", well he didn't, and worse, after I pick it up and turn it on it was not even recognising the battery anymore and the battery status is not in the menu bar anymore (If I check the box to show it it unchecks itself). He must've added another problem trying to fix the problem, since he was nervous when he handed it back and didn't charge anything. I know some basics electronics and have a multimeter so I would like to understand what is causing this. Could you please point me to possible faulty components that could cause this (e.g check <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> and so on)? Many thanks."

Since the store who sold me the battery ask me to send it back, I sent it  to them a few days ago.
