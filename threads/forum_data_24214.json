I replaced all the components in those areas and after all this now the fan does the usual on and off fan spin 3 times but after about 1 second the fan stops spinning. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 8.6v and once the fan stops spinning o <SIGNAL>5V_S5</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL> rails are present.\n\nThere was also liquid damage to the JTAG connector which I removed. I thought the issue for this fan spin may have been because I found that Pins 30&34 of J6100 were bridged together but even after fixing that the issue remains.\n<CAPACITOR>C5120</CAPACITOR> did not look good so I replaced it along with <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>. All the proper voltages are present on <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>\nI replaced <CAPACITOR>C5003</CAPACITOR>/09 because they didn't look to well.\nThere was a little corrosion around <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> and <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> so I put some flux and heated that area.\n<CHIP>U1950</CHIP> and its area looks fine and I get 3v42 on <CAPACITOR>C1950</CAPACITOR> even when the fan stops spinning.\n\nIt is doing all of this with no external components plugged in."
