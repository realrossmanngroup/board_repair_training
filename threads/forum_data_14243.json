        "820-2914": "What is 820-2914? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW": "What is PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW? PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW is a line after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit for backlight that connects to the LED driver’s switch(SW) pin where it is switched to ground rapidly in order to create the boosted voltage for the backlight circuit. .",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKL": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKL? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVOUT_S0": "What is PPVOUT_S0? a SIGNAL.",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "U9701": "What is U9701? a CHIP.",
        "BKL_FB": "What is BKL_FB? This is backlight feedback. It goes from the output of the backlight circuit back to the LED driver, so it can see what it is doing. If this line is broken or corroded, the boost circuit will not boost PPBUS_G3H to a higher voltage for backlight, and backlight voltage output will be the same as the PPBUS_G3H input. This trace/via is usually the first to corrode since it is the highest voltage in the system..",
