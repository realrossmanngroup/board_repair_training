No issues at all. When on battery it lasts around 6 hours of continuous use.\nHowever-if it\u2019s plugged in on charge (86watt charger) and I shut the lid, 9 times out of ten I have to hold the power button to get it to turn on. It\u2019s also quite warm to the touch. Even after being left for 8 hours. When it does boot up I\u2019m always greeted with an error message saying couldn\u2019t shut down properly. Then gives me a panic log to report.\nAnother thing I noticed is while on charge the Touch ID does not work. If I remove the cable it all works fine again.\nthis happens on all 4 ports.\ndoesn\u2019t matter if I shut it down or put it to sleep if does the same thing. Have attached pictures below so you can see what I mean.\n\nive ran it in diagnostics mode and no faults where found.\nAny help would be good as a lot of guys I know that fix macs are stumped.
