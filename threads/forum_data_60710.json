        "EDP_BKLT_PWM": "What is EDP_BKLT_PWM? EDP_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "I2C_BKLT": "What is I2C_BKLT? I2C_BKLT is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight.."

            "message": "This is a rush repair I will probably get to pass on as I am totally stuck.   I am new to these boards.\n\nLots of things were damaged on this LB.\n<CHIP>U8500</CHIP> LCD  <SIGNAL>PP5V_GS3_ALSCAM</SIGNAL>   was damaged.   Replaced\n<CHIP>U7710</CHIP> totally smoked and sense resistors smoked\n<CHIP>U8110</CHIP> smoked and eating <RESISTOR>R8147</RESISTOR>\n\nAfter all that was fixed the machine boots but no backlight. I can see the apple logo with a flashlight\n\n\nI detect a short on the drive to <TRANSISTOR>Q8401</TRANSISTOR> <SIGNAL>LCDBKT_FET_DRV_R</SIGNAL>\nreplaced <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> to resolve the short.   Still didn't work  but my short was gone. so I changed again because I am real stupid and lazy.   No help\n\nBack light EN is present on Pin 17 of <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> at 3.2V\nVDD is present at pin 18 of <CHIP>U8400</CHIP>\n<CHIP>U8400</CHIP> is not pulling down the 12v on <RESISTOR>R8402</RESISTOR> so <TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR> is not getting turned on.  Both <RESISTOR>R8401</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R8402</RESISTOR> are good.\n<CHIP>U8400</CHIP> is not attempting to drive <TRANSISTOR>Q8401</TRANSISTOR>.\nPreformed PRAM reset\nusing a monitor flex adaptor to turn on back light circuit.   Tested on another LB know that J8500 is good\n\nWhat has to be present to turn on <SIGNAL>BLKT_SD</SIGNAL> so it pulls down the 12v to turn the thing on?  What am I missing here?\n\n\"I answered that question by following other threads on the channel\"  The SCL/SCA data lines. Thanks to \"\n[B][USER=682]2informaticos[/USER]\" [/B]comments on another backlight thread related to this LB.  My data lines are good and diode check / voltage check normal against a working LB.\n\nFIred up the Tektronix TDS scope and inspected the data lines.\nNo data activity is present on <SIGNAL>12C_BKLT_SCL</SIGNAL>/SDA lines.   They do Ohm out to the pins on J8500\nused known good flex and known good monitor interface board.   Verified with working LB\n\nThese boards sure have come quite a ways since the old <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> macbooks.  I guess burning a entire day to learn one is worth it."

            "message": "I kept hoping for a reply to this thread while I was working on the board.  I ended up answering my own questions and digging deeper and deeper into the problem as the day went on.  \n\nThis was the only machine I worked on today.  I had no idea how complex the backlight circuit was until today on these.   I did make a test jig using a totaled screen.  Ripped off the screen board to test communication with the LB so I can enable and test the back light without having to put the stupid board back into the computer or use a awkward test screen.\n\nI think this machine was the victim of some sort of ESD strike that came in through the monitor.  Not sure.   I have no idea how so many systems could be affected at the same time like this.  I do not know and may never know why the SCL/SDA data lines are not communicating with this back light driver IC.  I do know the monitor interface board and ribbon are good and communication is present with a known board.   Now I am more than confident I can burn my way through these backlight problems on these newer boards with ease and in very little time.\n\nThis LB was a total board from hell.  It taught me quite a bit about how these boards work even though I failed and gave up.  If anyone has experience with the <SIGNAL>BKLT_SCL</SIGNAL> /SDA lines please add to this thread.   I will be watching in for the next few days."
