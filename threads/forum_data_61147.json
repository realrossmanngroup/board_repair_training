It had corrossion around <CHIP>U3700</CHIP>/<CHIP>U3770</CHIP>/<CHIP>U2890</CHIP>/<CHIP>U3900</CHIP>/<RESISTOR>R5640</RESISTOR>/<CHIP>U8210</CHIP> (pictures attached).\n\nI have cleaned it up, replaced <CHIP>U3770</CHIP> and <CHIP>U2890</CHIP>, repaired broken traces, replaced damaged resistors/caps. Also resoldered <CHIP>U3700</CHIP> and <CHIP>U8210</CHIP>. Area of <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R5640</RESISTOR> looks good after celaning.\n\n- board starts, switch to 20v and takes ~0,45-0,80A.\n- CPU gets warm, CPU VCORE is 0,945v constantly, doesn't drop to 0,6v.\n- <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 13,05v.\n- there is no image on internal screen, nor on external monitor with internal screen unplugged\n- no USB activity\n- trackpad clicks\n- no CAPSLOCK light when pressed\n- fan is spinning fot ~20s and stops\n\nI have tried clean ME bios from forum and board behaves the same. Dead CPU/PCH?"
