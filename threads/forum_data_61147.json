        "message":"I'm working on 820-00840 board which got damaged by coffee spill. It had corrossion around U3700\/U3770\/U2890\/U3900\/R5640\/U8210 (pictures attached).\n\nI have cleaned it up, replaced U3770 and U2890, repaired broken traces, replaced damaged resistors\/caps. Also resoldered U3700 and U8210. Area of U3900 and R5640 looks good after celaning.\n\n- board starts, switch to 20v and takes ~0,45-0,80A.\n- CPU gets warm, CPU VCORE is 0,945v constantly, doesn't drop to 0,6v.\n- PPBUS_G3H is 13,05v.\n- there is no image on internal screen, nor on external monitor with internal screen unplugged\n- no USB activity\n- trackpad clicks\n- no CAPSLOCK light when pressed\n- fan is spinning fot ~20s and stops\n\nI have tried clean ME bios from forum and board behaves the same. Dead CPU\/PCH?"
