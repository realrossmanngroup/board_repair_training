        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "U7600": "What is U7600? a CHIP.",
        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "Q7630": "What is Q7630? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4": "What is PM_SLP_S4? This is a typo of PM_SLP_S4_L When you see PM_SLP_S4, assume they meant to type PM_SLP_S4_L.",
        "3_L": "What is 3_L? a SIGNAL.",
