The board has had liquid damage but been cleaned, Looks like flux around the bios chip...\nThe board says 2.4GHz 4GB which matches what the bottom plate serial number is. It is a 2013 Macbook Pro Retina 13\" .\nThe serial number in the bios \/ about screen is invalid as well as the about screen identifies it as a 2015 2.4 4GB which I don't think\nthey made a 4G model in 2015 So if it someone edited the model identifier in the bios, is that where the year comes from?\nGiven all the inconsistencies is it probably best to find a clean bios file and not try to use anything in the bios that is in the unit?"}
