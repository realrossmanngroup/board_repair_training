            "message": "Hi Folks,\n\nGot a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that runs slow yet passes all AHT and ASD (OS and EFI) tests.\nDirty inside but after a good cleaning no signs of corrosion. Same behavior with or without battery and other component isolation.\nFigured this would be a sensor issue but no issues are found.\n\nThis was handed to me with reports of slow performance and occasional fan on max behavior (have not seen the fan on high myself).\n\nPrior to cleaning the Mac froze when booting from a USB KG OS and restarted itself when I tried to launch an app, this behavior is gone after cleaning.\nAlso had the 3 RAM beeps once after assembly but reseating the RAM solved that. Battery is a compatible model A1322.\n\nIf not a sensor issue, what could cause the slowdown?"

I cleaned a few sections of the board with alcohol as they did not look 100% (dirt, no corrosion) and found that the whole upper section of the board is covered in a film of something greasy. Alcohol is repelled. It’s not visible but I can scrape it with tweezers, barely 1mm thick but I assume this stuff is under the SMC, CPU as well...\n\nWithout an ultrasonic cleaner ima have to pass on this one it looks like.\n\nAs for flashing a bios, that’s way out of my wheelhouse. I’ll get there but am not there yet :)\nThanks for sharing that though."
