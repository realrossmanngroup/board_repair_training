This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. ."

Had quite some damage on the trackpad connector so have replaced that perfectly, however I have noticed that so many lines are short on the trackpad which I'm pretty sure are not meant to be ground. When plugging in the trackpad with new cable, the computer will end in a boot loop. so it will start only with that disconnected. \n\nAnd for the keyboard there is a chip on the other side of the board which on similar models is in charge of keyboard functionality, that looks toasty. However, I'm not sure if I can use some of my donors from other models?"
