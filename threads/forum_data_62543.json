No light on charger, battery not visible, fan full speed, ASD test showed:\n              \n- SMC: 0x0 SMC Critical Sensor Check [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- THSP Thunderbolt Proximity [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- TM0P MLB Top Side [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- TW0P Airport Proximity [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- Tm0P Memory Proximity [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- Ts0P Trackpad Skin [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n\nReplacing trackpad and trackpad connector solved the fan issue and battery was visible, but still not light on charger and not charging.\n\nReplacing I\/O board and I\/O board cable solved the green and orange light on charger, and now the battery charges. \nAlso, ASD test passed, no error at all.\n\nThe last problem is the status and date of the battery. With Coconut battery the battery date appears with date=1979-11-30 and status=Check battery.\nNevertheless before using it in this Macbook the battery had status=Normal, and the date was 2014-10-29. This issue happened with 2 batteries. When I put these batteries back in another Macbook the correct date appears, but the status remain Check battery for one battery, for the other it went back to Good.\n\nWhat could be causing this behaviour?"

Indeed it is happening on a Macbook updated with Big Sur, while testing on a old 2011 Macbook with El Capitan I have no issue.\nI installed Catalina instead and now the manufacture date  and status of the battery are correct, crazy!\n\nI will complain to Apple :D Thanks!"
