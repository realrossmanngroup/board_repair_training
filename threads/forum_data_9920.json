I have a TL866.\n\nI used the read function in minipro and had to uncheck \"Check ID\" to get it to read. But when I dumped it into HxD and tried to find the serial, searching for \"hwc\" didn't pull it up and \"c02\" pulled up an invalid serial when I tried to verify it on everymac.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong??"
