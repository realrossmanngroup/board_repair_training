        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",

        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",

It has orange and green lights on charger. fans spin but no chime and no display. Have checked with working display just in case it didn't chime or something in this model. \n\nHistory is i I replaced the display 12months ago. It has now come back dead and customer says 'just happened'... there is not any evidence of liquid damage anywhere whatsoever. \n\nSo I thought vcore but after measuring all the following I'm completely stuck now. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> 1.8v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V35_S3</SIGNAL> 1.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL> 1.5v\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V35_S3RS0</SIGNAL> 1.4v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> 5v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> 5v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_CPUPKG_VSENSE</SIGNAL> 1.9v\n*****<SIGNAL>PM_1V5_PGD_L</SIGNAL> 0v ****** not sure if reading this correctly <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>DELAY_1V5S0_PGD</SIGNAL> 3.4 **** shouldn't this be 1.5v here at <RESISTOR>R8137</RESISTOR>\n<SIGNAL>PP1V35_S3RS0_CPU_DDR</SIGNAL> 1.4v\n\ni don't know where to go from here. Would really appreciate some guidance please. \n\nThanks a lot. I'm guessing I'm looking for a reason why the CPU isn't turning on but I can't find one."

Try if a PRAM reset works from an external keyboard and see if caps lock key works.\n\nI do suspect that this board will have failed due to the drop a year ago. Ripped trace under some BGA is a very real possibility."
