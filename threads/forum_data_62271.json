Was liquid damaged around U3770, cleaned up with heat and flux. Has proper PPBUS, PP3V3_G3H, and ALL_SYS_PWRGD. PLT_RESET_L goes high, L7210 stays at 0.98V and doesn't budge.  Checked R1320-25, all have good resistance values. Have also tried heating CPU with good flux at 180C for 15 seconds, also tried flashing known good BIOS from the forum. Anything else obvious to check, or is this going to be a rabbit hole? Hoping something in the previously affected LCD backlight area hasn't affected the CPU, but everything in that area measures properly comparing to a good board."}

I'll do another pass around the liquid affected areas and see if anything looks out of place or damaged."}
