        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

Has proper PPBUS, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>, and <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>. <SIGNAL>PLT_RESET_L</SIGNAL> goes high, L7210 stays at 0.98V and doesn't budge.  Checked <RESISTOR>R1320</RESISTOR>-25, all have good resistance values. Have also tried heating CPU with good flux at 180C for 15 seconds, also tried flashing known good BIOS from the forum. Anything else obvious to check, or is this going to be a rabbit hole? Hoping something in the previously affected LCD backlight area hasn't affected the CPU, but everything in that area measures properly comparing to a good board."
