        "PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the backlight on the LCD screen, this is necessary to get the screen to light up..",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_PLT_RST_L": "What is BKLT_PLT_RST_L? a SIGNAL.",

        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "R7789": "What is R7789? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7788": "What is R7788? a RESISTOR.",
        "R1430": "What is R1430? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "BKLT_PLT_RSTL": "What is BKLT_PLT_RSTL? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

            "message": "<TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is a transistor that will let the power from the backlight fuse(<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>) through to the system during conditions that power should be let through to the system(system is on, not sleeping, etc). This transistor is a P channel MOSFET that will allow power to flow from the source(pin 4) to the drain(pin 1/2/5/6) if the voltage on the gate(pin 3) is less than the voltage on the source(pin 4).\n\nSo look at how this is set up. <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR> takes the 8.5v from pin 4(source) and brings it to the gate(pin 3), so that the voltage on both pins is equal, which means it'll never open. Fuck. :( This is what <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> & <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> are for. <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR> by itself just takes 8.5v from the source and puts it on the gate of the transistor. However, when <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> is given a path to ground, <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> become a [I]voltage divider[/I] that lowers the voltage on the middle point between them. <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> will send some power to ground from <RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR>, which will lower the voltage at pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> to 3v, but only if pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> is given a path to ground.\n\nSo we know in order for <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> to allow power through to the backlight circuit, its gate(3) has to be lower voltage than its source(4). This means that <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> has to be given a path to ground. <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> sits between <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> and ground, though! <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> is a set of two transistors, but these are a little different than <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>. These are N channel mosfets. These will let power flow from source to drain when the voltage on the gate is around equal or higher than the voltage on the source.\n\nSo let's check the source here... source is ground, aka 0v. So anything on the gate at all should cause it to open. \n\nSo <SIGNAL>BKLT_PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL> is 3.3v, which is great, but <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> is 0v, which is bad.. this means it isn't going to open, which means <RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR> doesn't get to send some of the 8.5v from pin 3(gate) of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> to ground, which means <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> will never open. aka no backlight. \n\nNow, we have to think about what would cause this. <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> comes from the PCH/CPU chip, <CHIP>U0500</CHIP>. Under what circumstances would the CPU say [I]\"hey don't make a backlight!\" [/I]??\n\nMaybe if it thinks the computer is closed? \n\nSo now we have to figure out when it thinks the computer is closed. find <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> and measure it. This should be 3.4v when the laptop is open, and 0v-0.5v when the laptop is closed. In practice, a voltage as low as 3.1v-3.2v can fuck with the backlight circuit in my experience. So measure <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>, while the computer is on, and open, to confirm that the board thinks the machine is open for use.\n\n<SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> could not be being created because of something like that. However, it could also be getting created, but be shorted to ground by something that is malfunctioning. A short circuit to ground means that some fucked up component or pathway is sending a signal to ground(the black hole for electricity for the purposes of our discussion where if it goes it will never to be seen again)\n\nCorrosion can also short <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> to ground as well. You have to find places where <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> has a path to ground. <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> is one of those places, the CPU is one of those places, <RESISTOR>R1430</RESISTOR> is one of those places.. I'm not saying the latter two are at ALL common, but anything is possible.\n\nIn terms of making measurements, here's where we will just be hardasses and say you just have to figure out some of this shit on your own. We can point you in the right direction but as duke always says \"engaging brains\" is necessary here. In the sticky he linked you to there are literally colored lines and arrows pointing to specific points. I say you should measure voltage at backlight output, and when you look at the page, the last point is [I]<SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>. [/I]This also shows up on the LCD connector on pins 3/4 and when you look at the LCD connector page, is the only logical signal that could have anything to do with backlight. You will have to be able to close these small gaps in logic on your own and be a detective in some ways or you'll be fucked, even with our advice. \n\nBest of luck!"

Which is weird. Then I decided to make sure that the LVDS connector was soldered well and had no corrosion.  After that I plugged in the display and it blew the backlight fuse.  \n-Replaced backlight fuse. Now no 3.4v on LCD connector.\n\nHere are my readings now.\n\n<RESISTOR>R7788</RESISTOR>  PIN  1 = 7.88V\n             PIN 2 = 7.66V\n\n<RESISTOR>R7789</RESISTOR>  PIN 1 = 7.66V\n             PIN 2 = 7.56V\n\n\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR>  PIN 3  = 7.58v  ( should it  be lower? )\n             PIN 2 (<SIGNAL>BKLT_PLT_RSTL</SIGNAL>) = 3.34v\n             PIN 5 (<SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL>) was giving me 3.4v and now is 0v after unplugging LCD connector.\n\nSo it looks like the voltage is getting lower from <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> but is it now low enough?  I know that there could be a short somewhere but if you think replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR> might be the right direction?\n\nThank you again for all your help.  I have put in mad hours to learn more and not have your time wasted."

Would that make any difference if somehow this \"working LCD I bought is bad. Also could I have just mangled the WLED driver replacement? I've Replaced it 3 times, desoldered the pads (all of them look nice) and have tried to get it perfect. Not heating it forever and seeing the chip move so that I know all balls are melted.
