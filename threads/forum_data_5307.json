I don't know what to measure. \nGot a 820-3462 board with not a sceric of water damage to be found under the microscope. \nLaptop works fine on cord but battery is always showing an X. \nTried a new battery and a working second hand battery. Same prob. \nPower rails exist obviously because it turns on. So SMC? How do I tell if this problem is the SMC or not?\nPretty confused on this one. \nThanks."}

It's one of the screws holding the battery to the board, and if not present nothing with the battery will work, it is not magnetic, so everyone loses it."}
