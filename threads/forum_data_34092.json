            "message": "Hey all, got a a MBA the other day that was 3 beeping me. Checked out the voltage going to the ram and it is sitting at 1.35V. The schematic says 1.5V and with ram, I know that could be a big difference but wasn't too sure as i though desktop ram is normally around that 1.32v range. Maybe my brain isn't working right there.\n\nSo, I think the ram is getting OK voltage, and not normally accepting 3beep issues, I reflowed (reflew?) the ram. I left the heatsink on the CPU thinking it would wick excessive heat off and verified each ram was melty by micro bumping it (cant see it dancing with my microscope.)\n\nI use way too much flux like good ol Rossman in his most recent 3 beep repair here he did the same.\n\nThe computer booted right up afterwards with no issues, until i noticed that there is no SN under system info - it says not available (or the equivalence in spanish) Then a minute later, the image became distorted  and froze up. I tried a few more times until it gave me a 3 beep error again. I let it sit for a few min, and the it booted up again. So something heat related?\n\nAny ideas where to go from here? Is that 1.35V ok for <SIGNAL>PPDDR_S3_REG</SIGNAL>?\nThanks!"
