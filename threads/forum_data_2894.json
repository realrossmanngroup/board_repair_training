        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

I have a normal MagSafe light, SMC reset works fine, SMC bypass causes a millisecond fan spin.\n\nI've repaired and replaced components in every area that was even slightly damaged just to make sure there was nothing unexpectedly causing a failure. I've taken diode measurements against a good board and can't find anything off.

The one thing that I think is hurting the cause is that there were tiny amounts of corrosion in a few different areas. It definitely wasn't concentrated on just one area, but it was things like backlight, PPBUS and 3V42."

One is to add your issue that is close or similar to the original poster's, and the second is to say something like, \"I have the exact same problem, any progress?' The former gets chaotic pretty fast, while the latter feels reasonable and is sometimes helpful for people involved. I think the key is that it really needs to be the exact same issue. Once you start posting things like, \"this is what's happening to mine\" the thread gets convoluted. Hope that helps. btw, I'll update this once I ever get a chance to get back to this board."
