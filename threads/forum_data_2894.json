        "message":"I'm getting my ass handed to me by this 2015 Air board. It had very light corrosion scattered in a few places, mostly around the 3V42 circuit and other PPBUS components, but not near the ISL6259 charging area, that all looks perfect and measures normally (voltage, diode.) 3V42 and PPBUS were always there and did not require any repairs to get them going. I have a normal MagSafe light, SMC reset works fine, SMC bypass causes a millisecond fan spin.\n\nI've repaired and replaced components in every area that was even slightly damaged just to make sure there was nothing unexpectedly causing a failure. I've taken diode measurements against a good board and can't find anything off. I've reached the end of what I can do with it so if anyone has a helpful idea for a next step it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have:\n\u2022 3V42\n\u2022 PPBUS\n\u2022 PPVRTC\n\u2022 5V_S5\n\u2022 3V3_S5\n\u2022 3V3_SUS\n\u2022 PP1V05_SUS\n\nI don't have:\n\u2022 PP5V_S4RS3 (0V)\n\u2022 PP3V3_S4 (0.346V)\n\u2022 Every other voltage line on the Power Aliases page"

I did originally change U1900 because SYSCLK_CLK25M_X2_R was at 0.025V and SYSCLK_CLK25M_X1 is at 0.65V. No change after replacing that though.\n\nThis is hard because the areas that had corrosion seem pretty innocuous as far as the board turning on. The one thing that I think is hurting the cause is that there were tiny amounts of corrosion in a few different areas. It definitely wasn't concentrated on just one area, but it was things like backlight, PPBUS and 3V42."

One is to add your issue that is close or similar to the original poster's, and the second is to say something like, \"I have the exact same problem, any progress?' The former gets chaotic pretty fast, while the latter feels reasonable and is sometimes helpful for people involved. I think the key is that it really needs to be the exact same issue. Once you start posting things like, \"this is what's happening to mine\" the thread gets convoluted. Hope that helps. btw, I'll update this once I ever get a chance to get back to this board."
