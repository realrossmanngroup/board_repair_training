I have a special case (i think so:-) and I do not know if the post belongs here but i try:  I have a macbook pro <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> - logicboard is broken (screwdriver or projectile destroyed the logicboard) and the customer has valuable data stored on it which he will pay everything for to get. I am aware that Nand needs to be moved ... should T2 chip, soc-rom also be swapped? what else to swap to the new logicboard? thanks for the help:-)."
