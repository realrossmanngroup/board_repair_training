All major power rails are present, expect for the cpu core, which is shorted with a 0.001 diode drop to ground. I pulled L4210, 20, and 30 and observed that the CPU side is still severely shorted, while the supply is perfectly functional (and stopped clicking), and the device consumes 500mA with the coils removed. I tried injecting power into vcore, but it pulls 6A at 0.6V and maxes out my supply without anything getting warm. Is this a definitive shorted cpu, or is there anything else I should check before wrapping it up?"

Is it worth getting a 20A supply just to confirm that it gets hot, or probably a waste of effort?"
