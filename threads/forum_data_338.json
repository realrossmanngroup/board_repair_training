The pins where burned to dust!\n\nAfter all that the fan went on - off - on - off - on - off - on and finally it remains on and everything seems to work and my work were done right? Not really :)\n\nASD reports PPBUS is too low and I measure 7.6V on the whole rail. I donÂ´t think something is shorting to ground since nothing gets really hot.\nFurthermore all the resistors in the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> area measure good values...\n\nSo what did you think about this problem?\nShould I follow the rabbit or leave the machine as is?\n\n--> The customer has his machine already back for data backup since the machine works and he knows about the issue and he will report unusual behavior."
