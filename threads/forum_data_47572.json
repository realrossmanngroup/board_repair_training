It actually chime after 25 seconds, always.\nAfter that you get the apple logo and then the password screen, but only for a few seconds, because it turns off. Actually PPVcore and S0 rails turn off, I have 5V S3 and 3.3V S3, didn?t mesaure other lines. \nFan never spins, but board never gets hot. And in the fan conector I have 5V before it turns off.\n\nNo liquid damage, boards looks really nice under the microscope.\n\nWhat should I try next, SMC, RAM, CPU?"

I upgrade firmware and install Mojave in my SSD, still works fine. My plan is to backup his info and erase and install all in his SSD,\n\nSo now I need to install a Bios with the serial number of the Macbbok. \nIs my first time doing this, any other step, after editing the bios with the serial number?"
