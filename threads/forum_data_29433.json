If I connect the trackpad after boot, it works without issues. Also shows up as USB device.\n\nIn verbose mode the last line before turning black is \"Airport Link Up on awdl0\". Removed Airport but still same behaviour. Also, AP and BT work without issues.\n\nAny idea?\n\nThanks!"}

Without trackpad the CPU is clocked down so it will not crash. Still no solution as I have no time to spend on this."}
