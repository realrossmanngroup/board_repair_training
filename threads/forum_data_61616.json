With injected voltage - 3 CD3215 switching to 20 volts and rebooting, UB400 is not reacting for charger at all. USB-C meter doesn't turns on.\nChecked the board with thermal cam - nothing gets hot. But looks like there is a short circuit somewhere...How can i find it?"}

This pin goes to resistor RB305, and it should be 1 MOhm. I removed RB305, puted back UB400 and mac works.\n   What is weird - i thought when resistor goes bad - resistance can only get higher value, not less. Is it possible that 1M resistor became 26 Ohm?\nOr RB is not a resistor?\nAnd one more question: is it necessary to solder back new RB305, or i can just remove it and forget about it?"}
