This pin goes to resistor RB305, and it should be 1 MOhm. I removed RB305, puted back UB400 and mac works.\n   What is weird - i thought when resistor goes bad - resistance can only get higher value, not less. Is it possible that 1M resistor became 26 Ohm?\nOr RB is not a resistor?\nAnd one more question: is it necessary to solder back new RB305, or i can just remove it and forget about it?"
