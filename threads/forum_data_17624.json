I don't have a working spare, only donors.\n\nI am dealing with this board and finding shorts. Both of these rails were shorted to ground, both around 32 on diode mode.  I already removed <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> (not sure why I removed <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> as doesn't seem relevant now) when working on this before. I gave up due to lack of confidence but feel my skills have improved a bit since last looking at it. They are still off the board.\n\nI looked around the board for any obvious issues but didn't see anything so I injected 3.42v and found that <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> (after a while because of foam covering) got hot. I have removed this and diode mode got me to 32 on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>.\n\nI then removed the caps and resistors associated to this circuit and have got to 160 on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>.\n\nThe short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> also improved and this is now 110 diode mode.\n\nAre these values correct with the chips I have removed? Shall I just put <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> back on the board now and test again?\n\nThanks"
