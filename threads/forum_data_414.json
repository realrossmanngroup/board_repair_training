        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "C7771": "What is C7771? Tantalum capacitor on 820-2330 and 820-2532 logic boards that often dies and causes PP1V05_S5_MCP or PP1V05_S5 to be 0.331v instead of 1.05v. If heating this cap restores voltage to this rail, replace.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
