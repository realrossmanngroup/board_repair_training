SMC should be correct one yes. \n\nHaving 3.4V at pin 6 of the ISL is what determines the base voltage of ppbus G3H, correct? I'm thinking it can't be a coincidence that I'm getting 8.65 sometimes 5V and was getting the proper 12.65 but aren't those the values I'd get from properly boosted by SMC PPBUS based on CELL being either 1 cell (5V), 2 Cell (8.65V) or 3 Cell (12.65V)?
