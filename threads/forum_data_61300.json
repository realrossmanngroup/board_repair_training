            "message": "I actually have 2 of these <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00923</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> boards that have the same issue. Both had the same initial damage, liquid damage on J4402 and pins 22 and 20 melted and damaged the board in that area and the touchbar cable. The rest of board looks completely clean. I checked and there is no short on either of those rails, and when I plug the board in, I get 20v 0.9 amps for a few seconds and then it drops to about 650ma and stays around there. I have 0.991v at L7210/20 and 0.767v on L7410/20/30. I do have USB activity (tested with USB flash drive and the light flashes steadily), but no caps lock reaction or chime. I get about 1v on PPVCCEDRAM_S0_REG_F, but have 0v on PPVCCEDRAM_S0_CPU. I assume there was an overvoltage on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_T139</SIGNAL> that caused the touchbar connector to melt, but maybe that assumption is wrong. PPVCCEDRAM_S0_CPU comes from <CHIP>U7760</CHIP>, which is powered by <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>, but the enable signal <SIGNAL>PM_OPC_ZVM_L</SIGNAL> is 0v. That enable comes from <CHIP>U7790</CHIP> from <SIGNAL>CPU_ZVM_L</SIGNAL>, which is also 0v. Not sure where to look on this now since that seems to come from CPU. Any idea what would cause this?"

I do not have any <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> or <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> boards that work right now, but I do have a working <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1989</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. I checked the values on that board and CPU vcore does drop to 0.6v and PPVCCEDRAM_S0_CPU is 0v, so I guess this voltage is not required. On these broken <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>'s I am working on, the CPU vcore voltage starts at like 1.1v and then drops to 0.9v, but never gets to 0.6v so its not posting. I am working with the board alone on the desk. I think the voltage from <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_T139</SIGNAL> leaked onto <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0SW_DFR</SIGNAL> due to the damage on J4402. Could this have somehow killed the CPU?"
