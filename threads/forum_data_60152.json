        "P5VS4_EN": "What is P5VS4_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "P5VS5_EN": "What is P5VS5_EN? P5VS5_EN is a signal that turns on the PP5V_S5 power rail. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

A blown or corroded L4901 inductor behind it can kepe it from working, inductor number will differ depending on your board. .",
        "SMC_TCK": "What is SMC_TCK? SMC_TCK is a signal that must be pulled up to 3.42v in order for the SMC to be in the proper mode to function. Often this is not pulled up because of corrosion or corroded resistors by the SMC. .",
        "SMC_TDI": "What is SMC_TDI? SMC_TDI is a signal that must be pulled up to 3.42v in order for the SMC to be in the proper mode to function. Often this is not pulled up because of corrosion or corroded resistors by the SMC. .",
