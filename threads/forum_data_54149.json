        "820-3209": "What is 820-3209? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "820-3209A": "What is 820-3209A? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PP1V5_S0": "What is PP1V5_S0? PP1V5_S0 is a 1.5v power rail present when the machine is in an S0 working state.",
        "PP1V8_S0": "What is PP1V8_S0? PP1V8_S0 is a power rail that is present when the machine is in an S0 state, meaning it is fully turned on, not sleeping or hiberating .",
        "PP1V05_SUS": "What is PP1V05_SUS? The PP1V05_SUS signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that supplies 1.05 volts, typically used in a suspended (SUS) state of the laptop. This state is a low-power mode where essential system functions are maintained, but the majority of the system is powered down..",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance â€“ this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",
        "PP1V5_S3": "What is PP1V5_S3? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVTTDDR_S3": "What is PPVTTDDR_S3? PPVTTDDR_S3 is a 3.3v power rail that powers the DDR RAM when the machine is in an S3 suspend to RAM state. .",

However, now I have image and the board is booting up like normal with an image. But the problem is now the keyboard and trackpad is not working. So new problems..

If its not the trackpad and flex/board as u described.. earlier the PCH became very hot. when I didnt have any image. maybe that was because I used 2.5 amp with SMPS the PCH got hot... or maybe some short inside of it, because a crystal clock was damaged earlier. However, I will check your info and revert back to this thread. thanks."
