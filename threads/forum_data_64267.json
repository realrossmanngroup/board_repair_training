Removed L7130 and the short was on <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG</SIGNAL> side. Then removed both [B]F7140/F7141 [/B]and the short is on the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> side.\n\nIm injecting voltage on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, however nothing seems to be getting not even ward. Im as high as 19v and 6amps"
