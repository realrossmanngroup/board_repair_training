Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

            "message": "Hi to everyone,\n\nI am facing a short circuit issue on a circuit board and would like to share my situation to seek advice and suggestions from the community.\n\nI have identified the short circuit on the <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG</SIGNAL> line, and I have proceeded to isolate the circuit by removing <RESISTOR>R7060</RESISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR>. Currently, I am focusing my analysis on the capacitors in the upper right part, specifically from <CAPACITOR>C7050</CAPACITOR> to <CAPACITOR>C7055</CAPACITOR> and from <CAPACITOR>C7090</CAPACITOR> to <CAPACITOR>C7099</CAPACITOR> [URL='https://imgur.com/mmMSY2E'](See here)[/URL]. Despite a visual inspection, I have not found any obvious physical issues under the microscope.\n\nTo proceed further, I plan to inject current into the short-circuited line. I want to clarify that I have a Thermal Camera. However, as this is my first time performing this procedure, I am uncertain about the voltage and current settings on the power supply. Considering the nominal voltage of the line is 13.1V, I am thinking of setting the voltage to that value, but before proceeding, I want to ensure the correct setup.\n\nI appreciate any advice or information you can provide on this matter.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nP.S. I have also replaced the <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> chip, but the short circuit persists."

It means now that the short is not on <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG</SIGNAL>, but it comes from <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. The value on the short is 95.3 ohm. Should, at this point, try to inject voltage or is maybe better go ahead with the isolation of the short?"

            "message": "Thanks informaticos, injecting voltage on that line like you explained on that post, I found who was the responsable of the short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. The responsable was <CHIP>U8050</CHIP>, I replaced it and now I have not short to ground on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>.\n\nNow the voltage on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is not stuck at 13.1V how it should be, but it oscillates from 1V to 13.07V and after 1-2sec it drops to 1V again to continue this cycle indefinitely.\n\nI found also a short on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL>, but I think is better to understand firstly why the tension on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> oscillates like that. What do you think?\n\nEdit: I found that the short was caused by <CHIP>U3500</CHIP>, I removed it and the short disappeared. Now, I go to replace all the components I had to remove  and will tell you\n\nEdit 2: Now it seems I've no short on circuit. But when I give power with usb-c and try to start the board, I get this reading [URL='https://imgur.com/1suNeFc'](See here)[/URL].  It means I have 20V with oscillation from 0A to 0.2A. I noticed that the oscillation of the tension on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is still present like before and when I read 0.2A on the USB tester, the tension on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 13.07V then when the Ampere on the USB tester drops down, the tension on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> does the same. What means that?"
