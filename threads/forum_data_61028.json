        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",

I track down the problem to <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>, and <TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR>. replaced all, and magsafe green light come.\na few days later customer came back, no green light. i see ppbus is 12.2v. I have tried replacing smc 3 times.but still ppbus 12.2v and no green light. I test my smc to my sure working board and smc is good. so problem should be on board side.\ni noticed <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is low at 0.7v at <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>.\nits not shorted, diode mode is 0.473.\nso to sum up\nI have ppbus 12.2v\npp3v42 : 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> 0.7v.\n\n<CHIP>U7000</CHIP> got proper dcin 16v, acin 4v, vdd 5.1v, and vddp 4v.\nany pointer ? thanks..\nfor info, i have replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> a few times too, and quite sure its not the isl problem.\nthe whole board is kinda *not corroded,but oxidized. all probe point is dark."
