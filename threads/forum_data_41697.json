I tried of course another bil button. Then I discovered the immaculate looking connector was in fact the problem...\n\n\nWhen I put back the board in the laptop chassis with HDD plugged in, it starts and shut off right away..\nIf HDD is not plugged, everything works great and no error found on EFI, it boots fine with usb hard drive.\n\nKnown working and tested HDD and hdd cable. No obvious damage on the connector.\nChecked for shorts on the connector and none were found. PP5V_S0_HDD is 5V present and same with PP3V3_S0_HDD (3.3V).\n\nI am suspecting something related to SMC_HDD_ISENCE, because in SMC bypass mode, the board turns on!\nWith no bypass, it starts and shut off right away.\n\nValue of resistances around U5380 (IHDC sensor) are ok.\n\nWhat do you think? did I screwed something on SMC when trying to reflow it?"}
