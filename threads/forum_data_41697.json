            "message": "This board had initially a problem with no holding off charger only and BIL button not reporting anything when pressed (led were working when you plug charger and when you unplug).\nAfter some tests I concluded too early for an smc issue and reflowed it because there is nothing much for <SIGNAL>SMC_BIL_BUTTON_L</SIGNAL>, but I realized later when I pressed the bil button the signal was not pulled down. I tried of course another bil button. Then I discovered the immaculate looking connector was in fact the problem...\n\n\nWhen I put back the board in the laptop chassis with HDD plugged in, it starts and shut off right away..\nIf HDD is not plugged, everything works great and no error found on EFI, it boots fine with usb hard drive.\n\nKnown working and tested HDD and hdd cable. No obvious damage on the connector.\nChecked for shorts on the connector and none were found. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_HDD</SIGNAL> is 5V present and same with <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0_HDD</SIGNAL> (3.3V).\n\nI am suspecting something related to <SIGNAL>SMC_HDD_ISENCE</SIGNAL>, because in SMC bypass mode, the board turns on!\nWith no bypass, it starts and shut off right away.\n\nValue of resistances around <CHIP>U5380</CHIP> (IHDC sensor) are ok.\n\nWhat do you think? did I screwed something on SMC when trying to reflow it?"
