            "message": "This board had liquid damage in the 3v42 and battery circuit area when I received it. It was not turning on at all and no light on the charger either.\nThe I/o board is damn near spotless and the other side of the board looks to have no liquid damage anywhere including the smc and <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> area.\nI put flux on the damaged components and heated it up a little and then the fan spun and there was a light on the charger. I UC'd the board and I was able to install an OS on the SSD.\n\n[I]The problem is that when I plug in the battery and then plug in the charger the machine turns on automatically. Afterwards if I shut down the machine and try plugging the charger in again it will not turn on automatically and I have to hit the power button.[/I]\nWhen the battery is removed the machine turns on automatically every time the charger is plugged in.\n\nWhen I go to the power information page I see the battery charges and runs off the battery fine and is in good condition.\n\nThe only components I have replaced are <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7006</RESISTOR>. <RESISTOR>R7006</RESISTOR> looked burned and was measuring around 50 ohms so I replaced it along with <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> even though it measured fine.\n\nHere are the areas I wrote down for having liquid damage before cleaning the board.\nj6100\n<CHIP>U7090</CHIP>\n<RESISTOR>R7006</RESISTOR>\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> area\n<CAPACITOR>C7117</CAPACITOR> area\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7560</TRANSISTOR> area"
