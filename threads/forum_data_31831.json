This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

It just doesn't fail consistency enough to get any feedback. It has all screws in now so it looks like its might not be a damaged board or loose component being affected by board flexing. Being that the SMC was replaced, I feel like something is slightly off with that, or with a component surrounding it. Can't see what it might be, but I'm out of ideas."
