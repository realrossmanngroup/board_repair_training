LCD connector on logic board in perfect condition.\nLogic board looks clean.\nAt first stage I disconnected LCD cable and connected external display via USC C and there was Apple logo, progress bar but after w few minutes restarts.\nWent to DFU and revived device and now got only Apple logo, no progress bar, no restarts.\n\nAny idea what next step? Restore or maybe damaged LCD connector did some damage to the logic board?"}
