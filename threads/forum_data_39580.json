            "message": "Hi guys I have a 15 inch retina 2015 with no backlight. I have 12.56v on PPBUS side and 12.45 on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>, on pin 1,2, 5, 6 i get 0.1v only it look like it doesnt get enable signal toopen the gate. On pin 1 of LCD connector also no voltage. I only have schematics for this board, just bought the boardview should have it tomorrow so couldnt test too much. I did figure <RESISTOR>R7701</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7702</RESISTOR> they have the correct ohm value. Anything specific with these boards that I should check? No sign if liquid damage looks as new. Also tried with a known good working display.\n\nGreetz\nArno\n\nEDIT: after i ultra soniced the board (just to make sure there is no crap under any IC) the voltage on LCD BKLT came back now I have 11v on pin 1 of the LCD connector. Will try to replace <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> if I have enable signal on <RESISTOR>R7742</RESISTOR>."
