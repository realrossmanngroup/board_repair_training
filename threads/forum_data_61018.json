        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

            "message": "SO this board had a burned VIN pin 16 to <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>. Replaced and cleaned up some other corroded  areas and board started and booted. USC'd it and now it mostly power cycles with short fan spin (same in SMC bypass). On occasion it will boot completely and stay running. Double checked solders around <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>. Found blown <RESISTOR>R7267</RESISTOR> and replaced but no change. Swapped <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> to test and no change. Tried reflowing the SMC but my best guess is something with USC has affected this board OR it had an intermittent issue prior and I didnt test it enough... Once I got the board working originally, I checked for data then installed in the Mac and fired it up without issue. Tested hardware and sent into USC. \n\nMy best guess is I have a borderline voltage for post that isnt usually making the cut. Just looking for some rabbit holes to chase down"
