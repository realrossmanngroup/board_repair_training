        "message":"SO this board had a burned VIN pin 16 to U7200. Replaced and cleaned up some other corroded  areas and board started and booted. USC'd it and now it mostly power cycles with short fan spin (same in SMC bypass). On occasion it will boot completely and stay running. Double checked solders around U7200. Found blown R7267 and replaced but no change. Swapped U6100 to test and no change. Tried reflowing the SMC but my best guess is something with USC has affected this board OR it had an intermittent issue prior and I didnt test it enough... Once I got the board working originally, I checked for data then installed in the Mac and fired it up without issue. Tested hardware and sent into USC. \n\nMy best guess is I have a borderline voltage for post that isnt usually making the cut. Just looking for some rabbit holes to chase down"
