            "message": "I got this board today that was liquid damaged. The user told me they took it to 'ubreakifix' and they replaced the keyboard and cleaned the board. It looked like they didn't clean it well because I saw corrosion and red probe points around the <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> / <CHIP>U7870</CHIP> area.\nThere was a light on the charger but no fan spin. The only power rails that were missing were <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4SW_SNS</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL>.\nI added flux to the corroded areas and heated it up before throwing it in the crest ultrasonic.\nAfter the ultrasonic the fan spins and now <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4SW_SNS</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL> are present but I get nothing on the screen.\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is showing 1.8v but yet when the machine isn't chiming nor is the cpu getting hot.\n\nI'm not sure why the cpu is not turning on if the voltage is present.\nAlso, the fan doesn't turn on and off 3 times like the '13 and 14' airs. Does that not happen with these 2015 Airs?\n\nUpdate: <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> and both sides of <RESISTOR>R1950</RESISTOR> are 3.32v and the resistors around <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> measured proper resistance. When I measure pin 7 of <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> I get around .25v and it goes down.\nAlso, on <RESISTOR>R1962</RESISTOR> when I plug the charger in the highest voltage I got was 0.7v and it goes down quickly from there. For some reason the fan will spin on high and I'm not sure if it is has anything to do with me probing on <RESISTOR>R1962</RESISTOR> but the fan will just stop spinning and not come back on.\n\nNote: These measurements were done with the board separated from the Macbook."
