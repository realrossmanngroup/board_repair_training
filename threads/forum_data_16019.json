I measured all resistors related and they came back fine.\n\nAfter replacing <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> the system had a fan spin and I placed it back into the system for testing, but to my surprised the flux that I hadn't cleaned started smoking right where <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> is at!\nThe system keeps running without issues and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and PPDCIN is stable at their expected voltages, but I don't think <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> is supposed to get this hot, or is it?\n\nJust gotta be sure before I give it back and it burns a house down ;)\n\nThanks!"
