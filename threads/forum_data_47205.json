        "820-00850": "What is 820-00850? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "ISL9239": "What is ISL9239? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2016-2018 responsible for charging the battery and creating the power rail PPBUS_G3H.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "CHGR_ACOK": "What is CHGR_ACOK? This is identical to SMC_BC_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

The other side stays steady at 5V. PPBUS is at 12.3V. LDO voltage is coming up to 3.4V and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is also coming up to 3.4V. I haven't been able to find any shorts. Not sure how these 4 ports are divided where one side is having an issue the other side isn't."

Diode measurements are all the same at around .180. Slightly higher than the older boards.\nI'm guessing PPBUS should be 13V and yes, this is an SMC-related issue. Board is not turning on with either side plugged in. I don't see <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL> in the 00239 schematic and I still can't find <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>. There's nothing that's standing out yet. The SMC area is very different. Those <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> pads are gone."
