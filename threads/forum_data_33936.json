        "message":"Hello, \n\nI got this logic board 820-2850, replaced C9560 just to be sure, it passed EFI and OS ASD tests successfully. I installed a fresh High Sierra on an SSD and it takes 65 seconds to boot. When running, it does not appear slow, however I get no sound. Icon in the top bar is greyed out. In preferences the output is \"Digital out\" only, although I get a healthy chime on startup. Also, trackpad works fine but in preferences where I want to enable tap mode it says \"searching for trackpad\" What???\n\nAny ideas?"
