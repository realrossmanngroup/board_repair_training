When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

Between pins 27/28 on <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> there is 20 ohms resistance, too much, right? I have replaced two <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and the result is the same... i have also replaced <CAPACITOR>C7120</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7121</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7122</CAPACITOR>,<RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>,<RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR>, but still the same. <RESISTOR>R7120</RESISTOR> is ok. What should i check next?\n\nThank you"
