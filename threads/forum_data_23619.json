        "message":"Hello,\ni am working on a 820-2879 that was waterdamaged. I cleaned it and it works again but sometimes it\u00b4s running really slow and the fan is ramping up all the way. I run ASD and when the fan gets loud it shows various sensor issues. If i run ASD again there are different Sensors failing and the reason why they fail is different too. The most common sensor failure is \"SMC IO failed\". Sometimes some sensors are also reading below the low limit or above the high limit. I attached a picture. Now i don\u00b4t know if it is a sensor, the SMC or something else. Thanks for any help."
