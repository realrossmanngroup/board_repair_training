    "definitions": {
        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "Q7130": "What is Q7130? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR? This is the input that comes from the charger..",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_AMON": "What is CHGR_AMON? CHGR_AMON provides DC current sense information to the SMC(System management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip). It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",
        "CHGR_PHASE": "What is CHGR_PHASE? CHGR_PHASE is charger voltage chopped up into individual slices prior to smoothing where it becomes PPBUS_G3H.",
        "CHGR_UGATE": "What is CHGR_UGATE? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_AGATE": "What is CHGR_AGATE? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_LGATE": "What is CHGR_LGATE? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_ICOMP": "What is CHGR_ICOMP? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_CELL": "What is CHGR_CELL? CHGR_CELL is a signal going to the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 battery charging chip that sets PPBUS_G3H voltage. Macbook Airs with 2 cells in series  in their batteries will have PPBUS_G3H voltages of 8.15v to 8.55v, Macbooks & Macbook Pros with 3 cells in series in their batteries will have PPBUS_G3H voltages of 12.23 to 12.56v..",
        "CHGR_VCOMP": "What is CHGR_VCOMP? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_VNEG": "What is CHGR_VNEG? a SIGNAL.",
        "C7140": "What is C7140? a CAPACITOR.",
        "TPAD_SPI": "What is TPAD_SPI? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q3088": "What is Q3088? a TRANSISTOR."
