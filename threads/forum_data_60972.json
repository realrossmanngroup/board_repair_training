        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "SMC_TPAD_RST_L": "What is SMC_TPAD_RST_L? SMC_TPAD_RST_L is a signal that comes from the trackpad that can reset the SMC when it is low.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. The trackpad having corrosion from liquid damage is a very common cause of no light on the magsafe charger & the system not turning on, when the trackpad or trackpad cable is corroded and holding this line down. .",

            "message": "Hello,\n\nI have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3023</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> MacBook Air with a keyboard / track pad issue. I found corrosion on the trackpad connector which I replaced and trackpad started working as well as most of the keyboard keys. I replaced the whole keyboard and now both the trackpad and keyboard works. After a day of testing, both keyboard and trackpad suddenly stopped working. I checked voltages and was getting weird USB _TPAD_CONN_P / <SIGNAL>USB_TPAD_CONN_N</SIGNAL> voltages (2.8 volts / 1.9 volts). I replaced <CHIP>U5700</CHIP> and now I get 3.3 volts / 0 volts and trackpad / keyboard works again. However after 1 day of testing again, it stopped out of no where USB _TPAD_CONN_P / <SIGNAL>USB_TPAD_CONN_N</SIGNAL> abnormal voltages again. After a bunch of measuring, seems the only thing left is the <CHIP>U2650</CHIP> which I replaced. Worked for a little bit, and again back to weird issue. I replaced trackpad to make sure that might not be it and UC'd the board. Same issue. I even tried with the keyboard disconnected and just the track pad, but seems to have nothing to do with the newly installed keyboard.\n\nAny thoughts?"
