        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. ."

            "message": "When troubleshooting backlight circuit, the output voltage is important. Different voltages tell you different things.\n\nOn an air, 39-49v means that the backlight boost circuit is working, but there is no load - aka, it doesn't \"See\" the light of the screen. Once there is a load on the circuit, like the light of the screen, the voltage will go down. This can be caused by bad LCD connector, bad LCD cable, LCD backlight cable being plugged in upside down(most common one), bad LED strip in the screen.\n\n25-27v means backlight is working and we are just blind. :)\n\n18-20v means that the boost circuit is partially working. This is usually missing <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> signal, or bad LED driver. <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> sets the brightness on the screen. If the LED driver is working but PWM is too low, there will be voltage boost, but it will be just below the threshold required to light the screen. Sometimes <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> is missing because the brightness down key is stuck down(liquid on keyboard), sometimes this is missing because the machine is fucked(you can just send <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> to the <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> line if it is missing to tell it to stay on at full brightness), sometimes the LED driver is shorting it to ground.\n\nIf you have 8.5v on backlight, that means no boosting is occurring. This can be bad LED driver, this can be feedback line from backlight output to ball A5 of the LED driver for feedback being destroyed(VERY COMMON). Also <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> voltage divider being bad - you need at least 2.7v on <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> or you get no boosting and wind up with 8.5v on backlight, which is just <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> being passed through the circuit. \n\nIf you have anything below 8.5v it could be a number of things. Here, if we have 0 volts, the first thing to determine is if we can actually see an IMAGE on the screen. If the computer does not detect the screen properly, and does not display an image, our issue is image/screen recognition, not backlight. The computer is smarter than an iPad, it won't send backlight out if the screen is fucked. So do you see a picture?\n\nIf you do have 0v, it is often a short to ground on the line, or dead fuse, or blown via/trace somewhere in the boost circuit. See on the top of my picture where L9701 goes to <DIODE>D9701</DIODE> which goes to output? If there is a break anywhere in that line, you get 0v on output, OR soemthing like 1.2v, or 0.125v, or some really low shit because the via is broken and making intermittent contact.\n\nEither way, in order to start properly troubleshooting what is going on, we need way more information. I have also attached pictures of some common backlight faults. Again, don't make fun of me and microsoft paint, it's all I got :( it works for GradeAUnderA!!"
