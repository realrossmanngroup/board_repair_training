The usual pink vertical lines. \n\nThe problem being i cant get 216-0732019 or 216-0732025 anymore to replace these dead chips.  I have tried from usual suspects from china\/singapore  and i just get sent dead bullshit garbage reballed shitty chips. (I'm not bitter)\n\nSo what i'm asking is there a straight swap with a PC based MXM card that will work in the 2009 C2D imacs, taking into account vBIOS mods. Basically like we can do with the 2011 versions, or is it truly game over for these now?\n\nThanks in advance"}
