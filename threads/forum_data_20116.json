There is no liquid spill, board is clean.\n\nBoard will start up totally fine sometimes, and then cut out into a 1/4 fan spin issue.\n\nPPBUS-G3H is bouncing on the scope, as well as PPDCIN-G3H,\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> is also cycling. \n\nI have replaced all current sense resisters, even though they where okay. <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, and the SMC. \n\nIts like the board has a short somewhere, but I cant find it.\n\nAny clues ?"
