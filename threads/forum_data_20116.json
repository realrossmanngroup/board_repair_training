There is no liquid spill, board is clean.\n\nBoard will start up totally fine sometimes, and then cut out into a 1\/4 fan spin issue.\n\nPPBUS-G3H is bouncing on the scope, as well as PPDCIN-G3H,\n\nSMC_PM_G2_EN is also cycling. \n\nI have replaced all current sense resisters, even though they where okay. U7000, and the SMC. \n\nIts like the board has a short somewhere, but I cant find it.\n\nAny clues ?"

Replaced those.\nLooking directly on the other side of the board, GND side of C8371 was oxidized."
