He did a force shutdown by pressing power button. Mac never restart.\nWhen connected to Apple configuratior, when I plug cable it will show as \"recovery\". I did a revive, didn't work. I entered DFU, did a revive fail \" timeout..\" after 16 hours. I did Recovery, DFU with battery. \n\nData are important, so before trying  \"Erase all contents and Settings\" is there anything else I should check ? While reading a post on this forum, somone had a similar issue but had no P3V3G3, he did a reflow of U7800 and that fix the issue. Should I try that first ?\n\nC8200 = P3V3G3S_SS = 3.39V\nR8200 = P3V3G3S_EN = 1.80V\n\nCB701 = PPBUS_G3H = 12.61V\nPP1V2_AWAKE = 1.21V\nPP1V1_SLPDR = 1.1V\n\nBig coil, diode mode = L7410,7420, 7430, 7210, 7220 = .11\nBig coil, diode mode = L7030 = .420\nBig coil, diode mode = L8410 = .961\n\nThanks\nSam"}
