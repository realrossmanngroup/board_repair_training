Mac never restart.\nWhen connected to Apple configuratior, when I plug cable it will show as \"recovery\". I did a revive, didn't work. I entered DFU, did a revive fail \" timeout..\" after 16 hours. I did Recovery, DFU with battery. \n\nData are important, so before trying  \"Erase all contents and Settings\" is there anything else I should check ? While reading a post on this forum, somone had a similar issue but had no P3V3G3, he did a reflow of <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> and that fix the issue. Should I try that first ?\n\n<CAPACITOR>C8200</CAPACITOR> = <SIGNAL>P3V3G3S_SS</SIGNAL> = 3.39V\n<RESISTOR>R8200</RESISTOR> = <SIGNAL>P3V3G3S_EN</SIGNAL> = 1.80V\n\nCB701 = <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.61V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_AWAKE</SIGNAL> = 1.21V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_SLPDR</SIGNAL> = 1.1V\n\nBig coil, diode mode = L7410,7420, 7430, 7210, 7220 = .11\nBig coil, diode mode = L7030 = .420\nBig coil, diode mode = L8410 = .961\n\nThanks\nSam"
