        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "C1802": "What is C1802? Capacitor to ground on PCH_SRTCRST_L on machines from 2009-2012, PCH_SRTCRST_L needs to be high for PCH to not be in RTC reset mode, this capacitor can become corroded or leaky and result in this signal being pulled low. .",
        "C3890": "What is C3890? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C1803": "What is C1803? Capacitor to ground on RTC_RESET_L on machines from 2009-2012, RTC_RESET_L needs to be high for system to not be in RTC reset mode, this capacitor can become corroded or leaky and result in this signal being pulled low. .",
        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. ."
