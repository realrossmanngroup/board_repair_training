Once i removed <RESISTOR>R8151</RESISTOR>, i now had a steady 5v for <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>. So i put <RESISTOR>R8151</RESISTOR> back in the circuit, replaced <CAPACITOR>C8159</CAPACITOR> with the same result, no 5v. I pulled <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> to eliminate the circuit being fed by it, and still wasn't getting 5v on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>. All resistor measurements are good, and the only capacitor in the circuit wasn't shorted but i replaced it just as well. My confusion is why won't the 5v return when <TRANSISTOR>Q8150</TRANSISTOR> is removed, since the only components on that line is 3 resistor, a capacitor and the bjt."
