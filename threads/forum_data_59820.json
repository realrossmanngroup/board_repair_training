I got it and took it apart and reassembled it carefully and it started to work. I gave it back to the customer and they gave it back to their customer. It has been returned for not working. So far I can get an external image via TB but if I turn on with screen it will light up for a few seconds then goes black. The fourth diagnostic LED also turns off. Once it turn off I cannot get it to repeat the fault unless I leave it unplugged for a while. I assume since I get an image externally, the GPU is ok. Any ideas on what to check next? I think I tried to replace the LED driver board before but it didn't change anything."
