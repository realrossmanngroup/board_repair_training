        "message":"Short Story:\n\nHey everyone, I ran this by Louis to get his okay before posting this but basically, I\u2019m going to be retiring from board repair due to other elements of running my business completely overwhelming me so I need to create some partnerships with some people to offload my supply of boards. These would all be fresh-from-consumer boards that you would have first-look at. I\u2019ll be making weekly shipments and selling them in groups by board model. Feel free to contact me if you're interested or if you have any questions.\n\n\n\nLong Story:\n\nI no longer have a free moment to work on boards so I need to work with other people who are looking for a source of boards. I have a pile of boards that is getting out of control and I no longer have any hope of getting to them. I\u2019ve considered training someone but, if I\u2019m lucky enough to find someone capable enough, it seems like the most time-consuming endeavor I could partake in so I\u2019m opting to just work with other repair techs interested in a steady supply of boards.\n\nMy plan is to sell them by model, so for example, I would offer up all 2015 13\u201d Air boards (820-00165), 2012 MacBook Pro 13\u201d (820-3115) boards and so on for all 30-40 computer generations of models I\u2019m currently buying (2009 and later). So someone could take just one series, or five, or all of them.\n\nI\u2019ve built up some established local sources (recycling centers, advertising, networks of individuals, etc.) over the years where I\u2019m getting complete computers directly from consumers so at least 95% of the boards are untouched before getting to me. They\u2019re not cheap, but the deal I have with everyone is that they can\u2019t be opened before I get them. So in my plan, my employees would pull the boards, clean them in the ultrasonic and any boards that don\u2019t come out working would go into the stack to be sold. As hard as it would be to know what\u2019s wrong with a board but have to move it along, I recognize the value of what I\u2019m offering is that the repair tech I\u2019m selling these to would receive 100% of all the boards. There would be zero attempts to fix anything so all boards, including the hard-fixes, the easy-fixes, the 5-minute fixes, the fuse-fixes, everything would go directly to the repair tech I\u2019m working with. We take pre-cleaning pictures of all the boards also so the tech I\u2019m working with would receive high-res pictures of the front and back of the board in its original state. Prices would be set slightly higher than as-is boards sell for on eBay. The value of these board would be much greater than anything that could be acquired off of eBay, but I think pricing it slightly higher than eBay would be a fair price for both sides.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re interested or have any questions.\n\nThanks,\nJay"

I've sent you a PM--thanks, Jay![\/QUOTE]\n\nHi Steven, I saw your message, thanks for writing. Let me come up with a list of what we get per month and I'll get back to you. I know we get a whole lot of the ones you mentioned, besides the 3330, but I also want to come up with a list of everything else too. I'll write you back tonight, and post the list here too for other people to see, after I leave work and have a minute to look through our invoice system.\n-Jay"
