In all other 3 ports it only has 5V on ampmetter, and 0.25A.\n\nClient arrived today from flight and says that it just stoped charging the battery with no reason, and it still doesen't charge the battery..\n\nCB306 and CB300 were burnt and his traces exploded. I've replaced UB300, but it keeps with the same behavier (it stays w\/o CB306 and CB300).\n\nRB260 was a bit burnt and I've replaced.\n\nStrangely I have 0V on PP1V8_UPC_TA_LDOA, and 0 on diode reading (mesured on test pad).\n\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC = 3.3V\n\nDiode readings:\nUB400:\nPP1V1_UPC_TB_LDO_BMC = 0.491\nPP1V8_UPC_TB_LDOD = 0.461\nPP1V8_UPC_TB_LDOA = 0.497\nPP3V3_UPC_TB_LDO = 0.497\n\nU3200:\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC = 0.488\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD = 0.459\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA = 0.495\nPP3V3_TBT_X_SX = 0.515\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO = 0.499\n\nU3100:\nPP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC = 0.510\nPP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOD = 0.477\nPP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOA = 0.517\nPP3V3_TBT_X_SX = 0.514\nPP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO = 0.500\n\nUB300:\nPP1V1_UPC_TA_LDO_BMC = .521\nPP1V8_UPC_TA_LDOD = 0.3486\nPP1V8_UPC_TA_LDOA = 0\nPP3V3_TBT_T_SX = 0.523\nPP3V3_UPC_TA_LDO = 0.500\n\nCan you help?"}
