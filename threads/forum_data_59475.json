Not sure how this happened and why it burnt as no other components have been effected.\n\nI've also remove the JTAG as this had a small amount of corrosion and I've replaced C3287, R3561, C3560 & U3560 just for giggles.\n\nI'm missing PM_SLP_S4_L, some readings\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 8v\nPPVRTC_G3H - 3.4v\nPP5V_S5 - 5v\nPP3V3_S5 - 3.3v\nPP3V3_SUS - 3.3v\nPP1V05_SUS - 1v\nPP5V_S4RS3 0v\nRTC_RESET_L - 3.3v\nPM_SLP_SUS_L - 3.3v\n\nPM_PWRBTN_L - 3.4v\nPM_RSMRST_L - 3.2v\nPM_DSW_PWRGD - 3.4v\nPCH_DSWVRMEN - 3.2v\nPM_BATLOW_L - 3.3V\n\nSMC_ONOFF_L triggered drops PM_PWRBTN_L to 0v\n\nPM_SLP_S0_L pulse from 0v to 3.4v\nPM_SLP_S3_L pulse from 0v to 3.4v\nPM_SLP_S4_L pulse from 0v to 3.4v\nPM_SLP_S5_L pulse from 0v to 3.4v\nL7310 - pulse from 0v to 3.4v\nL7320 - pulse from 0v to 3.4v\n\nI'm also getting pulse on the U1950, pins 3,5 and 6\n\nNot sure what else to check and why PM_SLP_S4_L is missing."
