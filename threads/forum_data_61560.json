        "message":"I'm working on a 820-01598-A which came with liquid damage - primary as a data recovery job.\nI cleaned the liquid damaged areas. The logicboard pulses 63-64mA.\nC6404 Pin2 is completely gone so i took the cap away - i think it's not necessary for data recovery?\n\nThe board shows no reaction. Here are my measurements ...\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12,600V\nPP3v3_G3H = 3,307V\nPP1V8_SLPS2R = 1,804V\nPP1V8_AWAKE = 1,804V\nPP1V1_SLPS2R = 1,102V\nPP0V8_SLPS2R = 0,798V\nPP3V3_AWAKE = 3.306V\nPP1V2_AWAKE = 1,199V\nPMU_PVDDMAIN_EN = 3,299V\nP3V3MAIN_PGOOD = 3,274V\nPP3V_G3H_RTC = 3,007V\nPCH_RTC_RESET_L = 3,007V\nP5VG3S_EN = 3,304 V\nPP5V_G3S = 5,128V\n\nThen i wanted to check DFU (i have not much experience with this).\nNormaly i would expect to see the DFU - Logo on the Display of the machine with Apple Configurator2.\nBut it shows me a Logo with REVOVERY. This Logo comes without pressing any Key-combination, only after plug in the data-cable (usb-c to usb-c). What does this mean? What is the difference between DFU and RECOVERY? \nAll functions i tried to use didn't work (restart, repair, shutdown, backup etc.)"
