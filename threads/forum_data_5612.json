            "message": "Hello Guys, I have a macbook pro i7  that has some light water damage on it. When i connect the charger to the computer without the battery it shows me a orange light as if its charging. It doesnt boot. Im assuming there is a problem with the current sensing. During visual inspection I was able to find some unhealthy components near the <CHIP>ISL95870</CHIP>.  I did a beep test on both sides of this capacitor and it beeped to ground. The resistanc eof the resistor that apears besides that cap is 10.7Ohms.  I have also reballed this ic since some pads were corroded. I would love to measure my main power rails and troubleshoot it a bit more but i dont have the brd and schematic for this board. Can anyone share or enlighten me? Thanks"
