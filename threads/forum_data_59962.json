The fans spin and the CPU gets warm, but there's no picture or USB activity. Also, it seems that <CHIP>U1200</CHIP> gets unbearably warm after 10-20 seconds, but not sure if that's normal for this model. Sometimes the laptop will make a sound when plugging in the charger, but nothing else.\n\nI have tried the DFU restore with Apple Configurator and it completes with no error (or any message, for that matter) but the laptop still won't boot.\n\nAny guidance on what I can check would be a huge help. Sorry for the plsbro question but I'm stumped on this one"

Tried powering up while pressing T but nothing shows up on screen and plugging it into other machine doesn't detect anything. Wish it did so I could get the customer's data back.\n\nBy <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> I assume you mean <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>, i think that's the main CPU rail as per schematic.\nThe line starts at 0V as I plug in the charger. About 20s after I plug the charger in the fans start and I measure 0.9961V. After another 20s it drops a bit to 0.9951V, then after 20s again it jumps up to 1.0067V and stays like that until I unplug the charger as the fans ramp up to max speed. All the changes are sudden jumps and other than that the voltage is rock solid, no pulses or changes that I can see on my multimeter."

I really wish I had a working machine to compare with, would make things much much easier. it gets hot enough that holding my finger on it for 10 seconds causes pain. it's not quite as bad a a bare cpu die or a direct short, but definitely hot. Sadly I don't have a thermal cam to measure temps. <SIGNAL>PP1V05_PRIM</SIGNAL> reads 1.036v while <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S5</SIGNAL> is bang on 1.800V and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is 3.33V, which I think is all the main PCH power supplies. Resistance to ground on <SIGNAL>PP1V05_PRIM</SIGNAL> is about 70 ohm after cooling down for a bit. If it's dead, is the PCH tied to the T2 chip or some other nonsense on these machines? Seems the chip is available on aliexpress etc."
