            "message": "This is a customers computer in near perfect condition with 170 cycle count. Brought in for preventative maintenance (blow out dust, thermal paste, stress test). Passed 11hrs + of looping ASD, all tests. Apple recommends this for stress testing.\nHowever, when looping just the Sensor Group (load) testing it fails the SSD - current IHDC, and Other current 3.3v High IO3R (see pictures). Not every time, just occasionally.\nTheres no recommendation for or against looping just the sensor load tests so I’m not sure if this failure would happen just from repeated looping.\nI’ve duplicated the testing on a 2014 13” without failure but don’t have a 15” to test.\n\nAnyone have any experience with this failure or have a similar model to test?\n\n2014 2.8Ghz, 16Gb, NVIDIA GT750, 512Gb, 16Gb\n\nThanks"
