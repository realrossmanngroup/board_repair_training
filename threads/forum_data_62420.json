        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",

        "PP1V05_S0": "What is PP1V05_S0? The PP1V05_S0 power rail is for various components on the logic board that require a 1.05V supply voltage in the S0 (on) state. This voltage rail is likely to be used by the CPU (for VCCIO), PCH (Platform Controller Hub).\n\n.",
        "PP1V5_S0": "What is PP1V5_S0? PP1V5_S0 is a 1.5v power rail present when the machine is in an S0 working state.",
        "PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS? This power rail is PPBUS_G3H after going through a current sense resistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H & the input of PPBUS_G3H to circuitry that provides power for the CPU..",
        "PP1V2_S3": "What is PP1V2_S3? PP1V2_S3 is a 1.2v power rail present when the machine is in an S3 suspend to RAM state.",
        "PP1V8_S3": "What is PP1V8_S3? The PP1V8_S3 signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides a voltage of 1.8 volts during the S3 power state. The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",
        "PP1V05_SUS": "What is PP1V05_SUS? The PP1V05_SUS signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that supplies 1.05 volts, typically used in a suspended (SUS) state of the laptop. This state is a low-power mode where essential system functions are maintained, but the majority of the system is powered down..",
        "PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS? This is PPBUS_G3H after passing through a current sense resistor that splits it off from the rest of PPBUS_G3H. The purpose of this is so that we can measure how much current is flowing to this part of the machine..",
