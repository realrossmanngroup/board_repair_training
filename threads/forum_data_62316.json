I already checked SSD0 power rail and i am getting 2.5v.\ni can also say that i have all the power rails including the <SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> which is 3.38v ( the power sequence was taken from  <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01598</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>). moreover in this case <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is 1.329v and <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S5</SIGNAL> is 0.44v however no short on those rails . <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> resistance to ground is 74Kohm and <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S5</SIGNAL> is 23.33Kohm.\nforgot to mention that all the ACE LDO voltage are present.\n\nUSB C ports of <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> are stuck on 5v and drawing 380mA - 400mA .\nFor those chips the 2 X 1.<SIGNAL>8V_LDO</SIGNAL> and the 3.<SIGNAL>3V_LDO</SIGNAL> are present however the 1.<SIGNAL>1V_LDO</SIGNAL> is missing.\nPPBUS is present 12.6v and also <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is present 3.34v.\nI checked the resistance of <CAPACITOR>C3104</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C3204</CAPACITOR> ( Use for CC1 and CC2 communication )  and both of them are 198kohm.\nmoreover i checked the CC1(<SIGNAL>USBC_XB</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>XA_CC1</SIGNAL>) and CC2 (<SIGNAL>USB_XB</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>XA_CC2</SIGNAL>)  of those <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> in diode mode and got :\nCC1 - 0.585v\nCC2 - 0.59v\n\nI also checked the <SIGNAL>ACE_I2C_LINES</SIGNAL> and got the following values on  <RESISTOR>R2834</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R2835</RESISTOR> ( <SIGNAL>I2C_TBT_X_SCL</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>I2C_TBT_X_SDA</SIGNAL> ) [B]Both of them are on 3.31v .[/B]\n\nI also decided to check and compare QB400 and <TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q3200</TRANSISTOR> .\nThose chips as i see it are responsible to deliver 20v to the board ( <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>).\n\nthe results on the [B]working[/B] USB C , QB400 and QB300 :\n1. <SIGNAL>UPC_TB_GATE1</SIGNAL> : 26V ( FROM <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>)\n2.
