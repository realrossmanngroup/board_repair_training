I have 3.3v on <SIGNAL>PP3V_S5_LCD</SIGNAL> @ <CHIP>U8501</CHIP> , <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SOSW_LCD_R</SIGNAL> is missing, <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_SLEW_3V3</SIGNAL> is also missing, <SIGNAL>PANEL_P3V3_EN</SIGNAL> is also missing but im struggling to see where this rail is created in diode mode this rail reads .546 so it shouldnt be shorted, any pointers in the right direction would be great"
