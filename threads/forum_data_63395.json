She said she cleaned it with baby wipes and now it won't come on! \n(IT FUCKING STINKS!) \n\nSo it does turn on, with backlight but no image, I get a chime and it charges, tried external display and got one then it went off, then it came on again then I couldn't get one at all so give up for the night. \n\n\n\nTried again today opened it up and it's immaculate inside, no liquid sensors triggered no sign of moisture at Al it looks like new both sides of the board. \n\nThen I tried external display again and it was on the user log in screen with it auto typing into the log in box.. Stuck key maybe?\n\nI then notice that if I power it off holding the power button it just turns itself back on again. \n\nIt also speaks to me and says \"username\" if I hit f12. \n\nSo I'm guessing the keyboard / TP are liquid damaged and the logic board is OK? but question is would this prevent the screen form working? I get backlight nothing else. \n\nI'm thinking if this is a new screen keyboard and tp it's not an economical repair. Your advice appreciated"
