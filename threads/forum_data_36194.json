        "message":"bit of a backstory on this computer. \ncomputer had light liquid on keyboard. Ordered and tested keyboard replacement, no liquid contact was found on board or drive. \ncomputer comes back a couple of days later with blown component on ssd. Looked over board again, made sure that ssd was getting 3.3v checked for any shorts. Ordered parts ssd, replaced compoennt on ssd and booted computer, created time machine backup. rebooted computer and immediately the smell of smoke. quickly disconnected battery from computer. same part fried again. but data is now safe. \n\nordered new drive, but afraid to install it in the machine, i know we don't have schematics for the ssds, but i am not certain what the motherboard is doing to fry this component. The component was labled c7h on the original drive, c7j on the parts board and c7c on the brand new drive. it is connected to the 3.3v rail. Can i find this component on any of my donor boards? \n\nI have just finished some more measuring and it looks like the 3.3v rail jumps up to 5v for a quick second when just powering up and then a steady 3.3v is this causing the failure."
