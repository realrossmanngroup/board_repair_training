If replacing a keyboard doesn’t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",

Swapped in two complete cases to be sure. \nNoticed <RESISTOR>R5704</RESISTOR> has 3.3v on pin 2 but only 2.8v on pin 1. On a known good board I’m getting 3.3v on both sides. \nIf all the caps after <RESISTOR>R5704</RESISTOR> and before <CHIP>U5701</CHIP> are good then does that point to <CHIP>U5701</CHIP> or is something else known to pull PSOC down?"
