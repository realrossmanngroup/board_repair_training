I have attached a picture of the cap though.\n\nConnecting this board to a USB-C meter it successfully goes to 20V, drawing about 20mA -> to about 150mA for a second -> to 450-500mA for a brief moment -> 350mA for slightly longer then back to 20mA.\n\nI do not know if is actually working properly, the cpu does turn on during the 450-500mA phase, I do not have a whole computer to properly test it.\n\nDo you think it is functional?"
