I did the reball in SMC, because it had oxidation near it. In the tests the mac spins the cooler, but there is no video and no USB activity. I cleaned the ME region of the BIOS, but the defect continues.\n\nVoltage: PPBUS_G3H 12.6V; PP3V42_G3H 3.42V; PLT_RESET_L 3.34V; ALL_SYS 3.33V; Vcore 1.84V;"}
