With charger plugged in and motherboard out of computer I get fluctuating voltages on both pins of F7140. The fan initially begins spinning but dies again after a few seconds. Shortly after it will do this again in the same order, however it does not always begin this loop immediately, sometimes it takes several moments. On F7140, I get 8.87V max for <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> which drops down to 5.32V, then up to 7.46V and back to 8.87V every times the fan starts spinning but the fan always stops spinning once PPBUS gets back to 8.87V. I also took some other measurements around the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> region.\nI am getting the 5.1V on pin19 and 20 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, and 4.32V on <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> pin of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>. I am showing 16.09V on pin 2 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and there is no continuity to ground through that MOSFET so I do not think it is shorted to ground. I am also getting 8.87V on <SIGNAL>CHGR_UGATE</SIGNAL> and 0.54V on <SIGNAL>CHGR_LGATE</SIGNAL> of <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR>, which I thought was strange.\n\nThoughts?"

Since this rail comes from the dc-in board, I went ahead and replaced that as well but I seem to be having the same issue with this missing power rail as before. After replacing with new DC-in board I took some more measurements and they are as follows:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 8.56V but drops to 7.4V when the fan intermittently begins spinning, and then back up to 8.56V when the fan stops\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> is 0V, but jumps to 5.09V when the fan begins to spin, and then back to 0V when the fan stops. This was measured at pin 1 of L7520. The resistance to ground on this line is 55.6k ohms\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.39V at pin 2 of L7095 and stays present with or without fan spin\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> is 4.98V normally, and drops to 0V when the fan begins to spin (measured on pin 1 of L4820)\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is 0V normally, but jumps to 5V when the fan begins to spin.\n\nI also noticed that sometimes when the magsafe is plugged in I do not get any green or orange light, but <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and other power rails measured above always hold the same values regardless of light being present or not.\n\nSo it is apparent that the board is trying to power on, but it can't and I think it has something to do with the <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> power rail but I am stumped as to where to go next. With new DC-in board, my results are pretty much the same as before. Do you think this problem could be because of the 821-1721-A cable being bad that connects the I/O board to motherboard? I unfortunately do not have another for reference and would have to order one, but would like a second opinion before doing so. Cable looks fine physically.\n\nThanks"
