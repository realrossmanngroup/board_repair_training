Don't see this one much. I have 11.5V on F7040 with known-good battery plugged in. Sense resistor circuit near ISL is normal. Diode measurements are fine with pullup resistors. Both resistors are measuring 2k\u03a9 (although they both were at 1k\u03a9 before I changed them. No idea why.) I'm stuck now with No Battery Available message. Any ideas where to look next?"}
