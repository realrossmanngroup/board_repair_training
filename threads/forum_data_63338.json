Affected areas are R7439, some corrosion on caps around 7210 and U7100. R7100\/7101 have been eaten away along with their pads. I have cleaned up all corrosion, replaced components, resoldered U7100 and recovered traces.\n\n-Board starts, but doesn't show any image on the screen and there is no chime.\n-Caps Lock doesn't light up\n-When I put it into DFU mode Apple Configurator detects it but can't revive or restore - after some time of waiting \"installing software\" just dissapears and shows lock with status \"booted\"\n-thermal camera doesn't show anything heating up\n-tested with other battery - the same\n-the only activity computer has is clikcing trackpad\n\nSome basic measurements:\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 12,72V\nPP0V9_SSD0 - 0,9V\nPPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0 - 1,8V\nPP2V5_NAND_SSD0 - 2,5V\nPP1V8_IO_SSD0 - 1,8V\nPPVCCIN_S0_CPU - 0,601V"}
