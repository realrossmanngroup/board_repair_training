        "message":"That macbook came to me after water damage , Pulling 0.006 on DCPS and when connect to the USB AMP Meter  only was showing 5.23v so i checked U3100 and U3200, so i have found resistor  R3033 which a [UPC_XA_HPD_RX] and R3034,[UPC_XA_HPD_RX]   and on both sides they measure 0.00v  so  I Thought that those were shorted and i removed and replaced them , as well as U3100 nd U3200 now i am getting on  R3033 And R3034 0.750ohms ,  Now i am getting the 20v on my amp meter but macbook is acting very weird , as i plug usb cable with amp meter , fan would promptly start spinning then stop then restarting again , but no image on screen , Can someone explain me what [UPC_XA_HPD_RX]  for and is it normal for their  reading 0.00ohms."

        "message":"First of all, welcome to the forum!\n\nR3033\/34 appear both as NO STUFF in schematic.\nDid you really found them on the board?\nIf yes, what value did you place in their position.\n\nTheir pin 2 goes to ground, normal to get short to ground, don't you think?\nBoth are 100K, if were placed on the board.\nI don't understand how can a resistor get shorted; unless it has low value as normal (not really short then).\n\nTry to understand a schematic, or ask for help BEFORE changing things without reason.\nYour power problem was U3100\/200 related.\n\nDoes the board stay on after second restart?\nDid you check for voltage on big coils?\nUSB activity present?"

Also do you have some specific coils do  i have to check or I have to check all of them?"

In Regards of R3033\/34  , I did not have a donor board to measure their resistance to compare , but funny thing about it , I changed U3100\/200 First  then check Resistance of R3033\/34 And was still 0V that was how i got confused , but with  that,  i was getting fan spinning then stopped but like i mentioned if battery is connected when connecting USB cable and connect it back that was when i was getting sound , But no display , no back light  on keyboard or screen , that was when i changed R3033\/34 and since then i am getting fan spin but very prompt and stop then restart again  but this time with battery connected if i connect the cable , i am not getting the sound anymore. do you have any chance have a good working board if you would please give me the resistance value of R\/3033\/34 I know one side goes to ground but the positive sides.\n\nPlease"

So  I am assuming that my backlight driver IC is working  , so can this issue relate to the battery or the flex that connect the lcd to the motherboard , i do not have  another flex cable  here to make a test. Please advice\n\nThank you."
