        "message":"I have a 13\" 2015 Macbook Pro that the LCD assembly was replaced by another shop.  It worked for 3-4 months and now came into us without producing a backlight on startup and it will only boot with backlight into password recovery mode? We replaced the entire board (820-4924) but the issue still occurs.  I tried a 820-3476 and there is backlight immediately on boot up and it boots fine into any SSD we put it into it.  Obviously the other shop replaced the laptop with the wrong assembly.  But my question is why did it work for a while? And what is the compatibility with 2015 LCDs screens??  I have seen some screens for sale that state they will only work on 90% of 2015 Macbook Pros. Also why are the 820-4924's only booting into password recovery mode?"
