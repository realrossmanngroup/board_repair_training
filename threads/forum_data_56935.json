        "message":"Hi there,\n\nFeedback line was missing because the pad was totally destroyed by corrosion (see the picture). \nRan a jumper to another pad (see picture 2).\nReplaced the backlight driver IC.\nStill no backlight. 8.5V on the coil.\nChecked BKL_PWM - was low (0.8V). Connected C7711 to pin 2 instead of R7704.\nBKL_EN is 2.7V\nStill 8.5V on the coil and strange backlight on the screen: I dont see folder but rather a whole screen goes solid dark color.\n\nPlease help. Thank you."
