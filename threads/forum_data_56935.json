        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

Connected <CAPACITOR>C7711</CAPACITOR> to pin 2 instead of <RESISTOR>R7704</RESISTOR>.\n<SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> is 2.7V\nStill 8.5V on the coil and strange backlight on the screen: I dont see folder but rather a whole screen goes solid dark color.\n\nPlease help. Thank you."
