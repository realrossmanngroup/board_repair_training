I went to the screen with a high powered light and no picture either. I tried a seperate thunderbolt cable to the port on the back and still nothing. Also hooked it up to 2 machines. Not sure what to start checking on this one."

Took screen apart and 2 strips in there and 1 connector had fallen off but tested all and found 6 out also. Thinking I need to get those fixed first as some TVs will shut right down if not a proper current draw. Found used ones on Aliexpress so need to put this on back burner for a month and wait for them to get here."
