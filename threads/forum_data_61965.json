            "message": "Hello. I got this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01987</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board in that was pretty badly liquid damaged. Most of the damage was around the backlight circuit and <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s. The board was originally stuck on 5v and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was only 0.7v and 0.068 in diode mode. I removed <CAPACITOR>C6456</CAPACITOR> and the diode mode value on PPBUS went up to 0.410 and now I get 12.3v, but still 5v on amp meter. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> was 0v, so I replaced <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> and had to replace <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> also and that got me 20v back, but no amps. Now <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> is 3.3v, but <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is only 0.9v, but seems to have the correct diode mode value of 0.398. I found small amount of corrosion around <TRANSISTOR>Q7680</TRANSISTOR>, so I replaced that chip and <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> at the same time, but still have only 0.9v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>. Any idea what else could be causing this or what else to check?"
