Keyboard and trackpad work perfect if i push option button at start : can select drives, enter wifi key and move the trackpad. After boot OS they both disappeared and appear the windows where i have to connect a bluetooth keyboard or mouse. \nThings done :\n- changed U4820\n- changed U4830\n- changed U4850\n- changed Q7979\n- changed U8000\nAll resistor and capacitors around these chips have correct values.\nThanks"}
