Keyboard and trackpad work perfect if i push option button at start : can select drives, enter wifi key and move the trackpad. After boot OS they both disappeared and appear the windows where i have to connect a bluetooth keyboard or mouse. \nThings done :\n- changed <CHIP>U4820</CHIP>\n- changed <CHIP>U4830</CHIP>\n- changed <CHIP>U4850</CHIP>\n- changed <TRANSISTOR>Q7979</TRANSISTOR>\n- changed <CHIP>U8000</CHIP>\nAll resistor and capacitors around these chips have correct values.\nThanks"
