I found some corrosion near one of the debug connectors, so I removed it. Later I thought it may be a BIOS Issue so I replaced the bios chip.\n\nInitially this board had an orange light (no battery), and the fan would power on for a second or two, turn off, and then repeat. I searched the board and found that the S5 rails were constant while the S0 rails were ALL turning on and off. Otherwise those rails seemed to be exactly as expected. I've checked every current sensing resistor I could find, thinking it was a sensor issue. After a week or so of troubleshooting, the fan no longer spins up. I left it whilst doing the spin-up routine for 10 minutes, came back, and now I'm here.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.5V along with all the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5</SIGNAL> rails.\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> 0.9v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.41v\n\n\n\nThe weirdest thing that made me sign up for this forum is that the F7005 18.5V fuse has 0.1ohm resistance, yet has 0V on both sides when plugged in. If I test the pins on the DC Jack connector, they all come back as 0 volts. So either something is terribly wrong or I might just have the secret for infinite energy.\n\nAny advice? I'm now looking to troubleshoot the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> circuitry to see if maybe it's responsible for my <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> problems.\n\nI have the board view, schematic, a donor board, a basic microscope/iron/air station and so forth."

Check <RESISTOR>R6130</RESISTOR> position for crap otherwise the issue must be inside the board.[/QUOTE]\n\nHmm. Maybe too much lead in my diet.\n\nWhen originally replacing the ROM (first thing I tried, before joining this forum), I shifted some things around and I thought I had blown one of those components off the board. One of them, either <RESISTOR>R6101</RESISTOR> or <RESISTOR>R6130</RESISTOR>, I noticed was completely missing! So I grabbed one and replaced it thinking I was fixing my fuck-up.\n\nSo most recently I've tried removing <RESISTOR>R6101</RESISTOR>. Same issue. I've then replaced <RESISTOR>R6101</RESISTOR> and removed <RESISTOR>R6130</RESISTOR>. Same issue - albeit <RESISTOR>R6101</RESISTOR> correctly measures 3.3k.\nSo I've lost the original ROM and the schematic doesn't specify whether or not the board has quad SPI.\n\nMeanwhile I'm going to be comparing with the donor to see if there's anything else I might have wrongly screwed with.\n\nThe biggest and only clue I have for this board was corrosion in the thunderbolt and USB ports. Is there a way to isolate that portion of the board? Just disconnect a resistor or fuse somewhere to cut them out of the equation so I can see if the core of the board is able to boot on its own? The Thunderbolt 15V boost regulator circuit outputs 0v, but I don't know when or if thunderbolt is expected to initialize."

It booted up, fan spins OK, and gives me an error related to serial number (expected). I told the retailer the previous chip may have been defective. They sent me another. New chip does the quarter fan spin issue. So should I just buy a bios programmer and do it myself? It's a bios issue I think, yet all my proper replacements dont let it boot."
