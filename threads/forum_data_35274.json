If it's zero, then PM_SLP_S4_L will likely be missing as well. Make sure you're using a known good 60 watt or higher Magsafe 2, but after that, check around the U6100 to see if you have any corroded probe points or resistors. Also check pin 8 of U1950 for corrosion and see if PM_DSW_PWRGD is present. If it is missing, inspect the SMC area for signs of liquid damage."}
