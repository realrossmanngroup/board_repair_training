        "SMC_ONOFF": "What is SMC_ONOFF? SMC_ONOFF is a signal that tells the machine that the power button has been pressed so it knows to turn on, or turn off. .",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. ."

Check <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL>, to see if it may be getting pulled down.  <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL> stable 3.4v even after fan stoped. but it drop down right before it shut off then went back up wile it is booting  after 12 sec fan spinging I get the chime and apple logo. then auto turn off . now nothing connected other tha dc jack as soon connect the magsafe fan spins then after 20 sec auto turn off"
