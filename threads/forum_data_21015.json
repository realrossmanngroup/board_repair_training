When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

So I will give it another try. My board is beraly water damage. turns on with battery, when connect charger percentage jumps to 100% I tried pram reset before realizing it doesnt charge. and doesn't turn on with battery unplugged.\n\n<CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> gets power\nbetween pins\n 17/18 - 4ohm\n27/28 - 15 m ohm\n20v PPBUS\n\n\nwhat I think L7560 - has only 1v\nif I remove coil one side has almost short 250 ohm - <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_CSN2</SIGNAL> is that normal or is it even L7560?

After plugin in power cord spark on <CAPACITOR>C4696</CAPACITOR>, I removed it. I still have short on L7560. after few min, green light disappear. later I figure out <CAPACITOR>C7552</CAPACITOR> in short. I replaced it, after I fixed it I tried to boot macbook with battery, another usb capacitor blown sparked( first <CAPACITOR>C4696</CAPACITOR>). all three capacitors are on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4_REG</SIGNAL>, started blowing for some reason.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> voltage increased to 4v. L7560 1.8v I tried to apply 1v to <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_REG</SIGNAL> as a result <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> get warm, am I up to sth or it is just first thing to get warm and I have another big capacitor in short?.\nI am really stuck here, Duke any ideas on how to go about this one?"
