Cleaned also corrosion everywhere.\n\nThe board is fully booting only in safe mode. Otherwise it will boot at 75% (progress bar) and just restarts, same thing with external MacOS. \nAlso it can boot windows with no issue. I can load the boot menu with option key or perform a recovery mode.\n\nTried to disconnect everything piece by piece nothing changed, (I/O, trackpad, keyboard, battery) only internal lcd left to try and use an external monitor.\nTried a successful DFU restore but nothing changed also. AHT test comes with no error found.\n\nShould I conclude for another dead CPU? :("
