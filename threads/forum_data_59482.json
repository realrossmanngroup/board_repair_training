SMC_TPAD_RST_L is a signal that comes from the trackpad that can reset the SMC when it is low.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v. The trackpad having corrosion from liquid damage is a very common cause of no light on the magsafe charger & the system not turning on, when the trackpad or trackpad cable is corroded and holding this line down. ."

I have measured for a short to ground on J4801 but I could not find any , I also tried to boot the machine through safe mode , but still unable to . I have replaced a whole functional top casing that includes the trackpad and cable but no changes"
