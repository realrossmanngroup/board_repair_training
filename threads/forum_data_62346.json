            "message": "macbook came in dead, after checking <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was only 1.5V. Replaced ISL chip and laptop successfully boot up(without battery)\nso installed into chassis screwed in the battery and tested boot up fine with charging cable. 2nd restart macbook does not boot up anymore, measured <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> back to 1.5v, ISL dead again, so i was thinking maybe bad ISL and replaced again but same shit happens. Conclusion is ISL gets killed with battery is plugged in.\n\nI measure all current sensing resisters and all was fine. tried replacing the battery(tried different vendors) also same. gone through about 6 isl chips now and still no idea why this is happening."
