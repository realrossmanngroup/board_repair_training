But right now i was just testing to tell you exactly what it does and its been lagging for a few secs at the startup but then opens into os normally i tried this 3 times now and it seems to be working. not sure why it works and then doesn't. it still seems to be doing it though i tried 5 times and now its doing the same thing over and over load spin the mouse shows up goes away and the load spins again it keeps doing this until i restart. unlike before when it was lagging but would end up fully loading.  The owner also said that sometimes if he put pressure on the macbook it would fully boot for him also.    I will look for traces of damaged areas. there was never any corrosion."

( the top ram slot im using now had broken tabs so its possible the tab was making it not work last time i tested it, i Placed a piece to put pressure on the side clamp and its holding the ram nicely)\n\nThanks again for all the help and info! this one seems to be solved and is working but with out one ram slot."
