        "message":"Looking for a way to source a new chip for the UT101 spot. Above removal of the chip that was there it completely broke in half and fell apart (yes I know, throw tomatoes). The caps were all replaced with new caps now and all that is missing is the chip. [B]L16A030D215[\/B] is what is written on it.  All other features with the computer work as intended. No random reboots, trackpad works, no throttling or lag. \n\nAny help or guidance would be great."
