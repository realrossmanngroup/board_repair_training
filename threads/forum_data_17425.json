        "message":"[USER=\"1\"]larossmann[\/USER] Thanks you for the info!  if i do a smc bypass by holding the power button down on a keyboard and then dropping the power to the board it kick on the fans they still glitch but get a good spin going and i test the ppbus and g3h rails and everything is working 12.5 volts on the ppbus_g3h.  is this a confirmation for the smc as the problem?  \n\nOf the 4 boards i have like this all of them give 12.5v on ppbus_g3h and 18v on pin 28 of the 6259. when performing the smc bypass 1 board spins, 1 just glitches consistently, 2 do not move at all.  i am guessing a few have other problems on top of the smc.   can i heat the smc to see if it just something fcuking up a ball? \n\nThanks again!  and happy Easter man! i think the damn easter bunny left the egg right in front of me on this one and it was rotten inside..."
