        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK? a SIGNAL.",
        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",
        "CPUVR_PGOOD_R": "What is CPUVR_PGOOD_R? CPUVR_PGOOD_R is a signal that comes from CPU_VR_EN that is necessary along with ALL_SYS_PWRGD to create PM_S0_PGOOD.",
        "PCH_PM_SLP_S0_L": "What is PCH_PM_SLP_S0_L? a SIGNAL.",

            "message": "No. The battery was actually good. This board came in a long time ago with minor water damage so I can't recall all that I did, very little though. The <CHIP>U1845</CHIP> I broke everyone I had off of donor boards. When the <CHIP>U1845</CHIP> came in the mail I put it on and couldn't figure anything out. (I will make a mental note about the battery being attached for testing!). When I first plugged the battery in I got the battery charging symbol bright and clear. I waited awhile and tried to turn on but kept saying charging. Then I though the fan has to be connected, so I disconnected the battery and put the fan on and it started right up. I only let it stay on for a few seconds into the Apple logo.\n\nOnce I put it together and turned it on again it was dim, I was able to see the login part dimmly.  So I thought it was backlight. But now I get no image -hahahaha !!!\n\nI'm kinda glad because now I'll get to explore the image circuitry because I could never figure those out on my previous run-ins with no image. Backlight I've solved a few, but they were easy.\n\nI'll do my research off other posts, & Louis's videos and see if I can solve this puzzle on my own : ) You'll probably be hearing back from me, LOL.\n\nI do get the dong and seen it working, so my hopes are high. It's not a rush job or anything.\n\nQuestion: Do I have to have the fan, battery and screen connected for testing around? Or just the battery and screen?"
