The U1845 I broke everyone I had off of donor boards. When the U1845 came in the mail I put it on and couldn't figure anything out. (I will make a mental note about the battery being attached for testing!). When I first plugged the battery in I got the battery charging symbol bright and clear. I waited awhile and tried to turn on but kept saying charging. Then I though the fan has to be connected, so I disconnected the battery and put the fan on and it started right up. I only let it stay on for a few seconds into the Apple logo.\n\nOnce I put it together and turned it on again it was dim, I was able to see the login part dimmly.  So I thought it was backlight. But now I get no image -hahahaha !!!\n\nI'm kinda glad because now I'll get to explore the image circuitry because I could never figure those out on my previous run-ins with no image. Backlight I've solved a few, but they were easy.\n\nI'll do my research off other posts, & Louis's videos and see if I can solve this puzzle on my own : ) You'll probably be hearing back from me, LOL.\n\nI do get the dong and seen it working, so my hopes are high. It's not a rush job or anything.\n\nQuestion: Do I have to have the fan, battery and screen connected for testing around? Or just the battery and screen?"
