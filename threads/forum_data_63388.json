Full continuity to ground on D6902 pin 2. Full continuity to ground on PP3V3_G3H. Any way of testing the cap?\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThank you for your time!"

Full continuity to ground on PP3V3_G3H.\"\nSo you have short to ground on both 3V3_G3H and PPBUS_G3H.\nPost exact resistance value (ohm scale).\n\nRemove R6923 and check on which pad remains the short to ground."
