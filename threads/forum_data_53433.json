The crystal comes and goes.\nPulled <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> repealed and replaced and Bam! I got fan spin. so.... I dive into the toybox! I knew there were tons of <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> boards in there!\n\nToy Box first one I grab! <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> missing (<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>) does the exact same thing! <SIGNAL>SYSCLK_CLK25M</SIGNAL> is erratic. Pops in for a split second. Just long enough for my Tek 784 to trigger lock and and let me see. Then it is gone. Each time it does this I see the current bounce a few mA. Like it was just about to wake up. I changed <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> and Y1905 (careful not to overtemp) and no change.\n\n<CHIP>U1900</CHIP> pin 1 (<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>) 3.3v\n<CHIP>U1900</CHIP> pin 13 (<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>) 3.42v\n<CHIP>U1900</CHIP> pin 5 (<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5RS3RS0_SYSCLKGEN</SIGNAL>) 3.3v\n<CHIP>U1900</CHIP> pin 2,3 (<SIGNAL>SYSCLK_CLK25M_X2</SIGNAL> and X1) intermittent 25Mhz signal\n\nI am thinking that because all these parts come from donors I could easily be throwing bad parts on the board but I have tried twice now. Stop me before I rape a working board! These crystal circuits are not magic. There is not much to them. GIve <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> power and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5RS3RS0_SYSCLKGEN</SIGNAL> and Y1905 should sing like a canary. Hopefully I am wrong here and am missing something.\n\nMy Toy Box is boards I could not quickly resolve.   eBay has been a great way to learn!"
