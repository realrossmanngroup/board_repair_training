After replacing everything affected by the liquid machine was turning on and booting into OS. Customer wanted drive erased and updated to big sur. During the reinstall process machine kept crashing about 1\/2 way claiming there was a problem with your computer and showed the symbol with a X through it.\n\nAssumed it was a firmware issue so did a DFU restore. After the restore when the O.S was almost finished installing (Went alot further in the install vs before the restore)  the board  just died and wouldn't boot back up. Now when trying a DFU restore again getting the error message  \"The system cannot be restored on this device\" Device added from invalid state Restoring 0XFAA(4010) \n\nA couple times when trying the restore the fan would start spinning at maximum speed until unplugged.\n\nAll of the AWAKE and SLPS2R voltages appear to be present. What should be checked next???\n\n\nPP1V2_AWAKE 1.2V \n\nPP1V8_AWAKE 1.8V\n\nPP3V3_AWAKE 3.3v \n\nPPVDDCPU_AWAKE 0.755v \n\nPPVDDCPUSRAM_AWAKE 0.802v\n\nPP0V8_SLPS2R 0.800v \n\nPP1V8_SLPS2R 1.8v\n\nPP1V25_SLPS2R_SMC_AVREF  1.250v\n\nPP1V1_SLPS2R 1.1v"}
