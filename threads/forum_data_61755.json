        "PP1V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V8_SLPS2R? PP1V8_SLPS2R is a 1.8v power rail present when the system is in a SLPS2R state. .",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V1_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V1_SLPS2R? The PP1V1_SLPS2R power rail in the MacBook schematic provides a 1.1-volt supply in a specific low-power state indicated by the \"_SLPS2R\" suffix and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP1V2_AWAKE": "What is PP1V2_AWAKE? The PP1V2_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides 1.2 volts and is associated with the machine's awake state and is used for powering the T2 chip..",

During the reinstall process machine kept crashing about 1/2 way claiming there was a problem with your computer and showed the symbol with a X through it.\n\nAssumed it was a firmware issue so did a DFU restore. After the restore when the O.S was almost finished installing (Went alot further in the install vs before the restore)  the board  just died and wouldn't boot back up. Now when trying a DFU restore again getting the error message  \"The system cannot be restored on this device\" Device added from invalid state Restoring 0XFAA(4010) \n\nA couple times when trying the restore the fan would start spinning at maximum speed until unplugged.\n\nAll of the AWAKE and SLPS2R voltages appear to be present. What should be checked next???\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_AWAKE</SIGNAL> 1.2V \n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_AWAKE</SIGNAL> 1.8V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_AWAKE</SIGNAL> 3.3v \n\n<SIGNAL>PPVDDCPU_AWAKE</SIGNAL> 0.755v \n\nPPVDDCPUSRAM_AWAKE 0.802v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP0V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> 0.800v \n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> 1.8v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V25_SLPS2R_SMC_AVREF</SIGNAL>  1.250v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> 1.1v"
