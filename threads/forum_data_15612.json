Charge voltage is getting into the board\nFound short at C6994 and C6999, removed and shirt still there. Removed U6990, short still there. \nFrom what I can see on a schematic it should be pp3v42_g3h_reg coming out of u6990. Where does pp3v42_g3h_reg? From what I have found on the schematic it goes to the SMC so am I correct in thinking it is the SMC either failed and shorted to ground or something different?\nThanks"
