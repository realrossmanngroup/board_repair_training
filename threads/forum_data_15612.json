Charge voltage is getting into the board\nFound short at <CAPACITOR>C6994</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C6999</CAPACITOR>, removed and shirt still there. Removed <CHIP>U6990</CHIP>, short still there. \nFrom what I can see on a schematic it should be <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H_REG</SIGNAL> coming out of <CHIP>U6990</CHIP>. Where does <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H_REG</SIGNAL>? From what I have found on the schematic it goes to the SMC so am I correct in thinking it is the SMC either failed and shorted to ground or something different?\nThanks"
