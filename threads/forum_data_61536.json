            "message": "Hello. I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that had liquid damage around <CHIP>U4200</CHIP>, <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> area and PPBUS was shorted to ground inside the board under <TRANSISTOR>Q3501</TRANSISTOR>. I was able to dig the short out and replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q3501</TRANSISTOR>. I cleaned and replaced a bunch of corroded resistors around <CHIP>U4200</CHIP> also and the board turned on and booted to the OS fine. The touchbar was on, but it was not responding to touch. I reinstalled a fresh copy of big sur on it but it was still not responding to touch. I did confirm that touch ID was working after reinstalling big sur on it. I found that pin 15 on J4402 was OL, so it was not connected to <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>. I removed <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> and confirmed the trace was broken. I ran a small wire under <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> to reconnect this trace and also had to replace <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> with one from a donor, because I found the original <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> was damaged. I replaced it with one from the same model donor and now it boots and touchbar responds to touch like it should, but now touchID does not work. When I try and add a fingerprint, it gets to the point where it asks me to place my finger on the scanner, but then it immediately says it failed. I know the touch ID button is paired with the board but is it paired specifically with <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>? I already tried replacing <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> again with another one to rule out bad soldering, but I have the same issue still."
