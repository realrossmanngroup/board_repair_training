        "message":"i have a playstation 5 with faulty gddr6 memory.. the resistance on the power rail is very low but when i inject 1.5 volts it doesn't draw more amperage than a good working board. is there a way to single out the faulty chip without removing all of them? it has 8 of them. Could I damage it if i inject 3volts?"
