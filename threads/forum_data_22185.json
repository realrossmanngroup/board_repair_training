            "message": "Hi\n\nOriginally this macbook came in without a light on the charger, the customer did not know of any water damage but some other company told them there was corrosion (and they made and showed pictures I have in my possession as well), they 'Chemically cleaned\" it (read: Drop it in the ultrasonic and call it a fix) and it worked for a good 3 months until it just crashed and never came back on again.\n\nJust after opening I saw a very ugly looking <RESISTOR>R6995</RESISTOR> which measured >10MOhm resistance, instead of the 1MOhm it should've. The Coil didn't look very well either, and I replaced both for good measure. Macbook worked again and kept working for a couple of days before it had the same issue again.\n\nThe board looks somewhat clean for a board this old, no signs of bad corrosion and all components are looking okay.\n\nI found that <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> was defective, as there was power going in but nothing coming out even though there is no short on the line and replaced <CHIP>U6990</CHIP>\nIt still had the same issues, but I thought that maybe I broke it with too much heat, bad soldering or just bad chip. So I tried it again with a new chip while being extra careful of its environment, however the issue stayed.\n\nVIN(7)/EN(4) = 18.4V\nVCC(8)/FB(2) = 3.74V\nSW(6) = 0V\nBYP(9) = 0V (Obviously)\n\n<RESISTOR>R6995</RESISTOR> = 998kOhm\nNo short to ground on <SIGNAL>P3V42G3H_SW</SIGNAL>\nNo short to ground on <SIGNAL>P3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>\n\nAny idea?"
