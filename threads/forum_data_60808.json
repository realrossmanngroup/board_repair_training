If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

I have checked ALL voltages and they are all good. No short to ground on any power lines. I then went ahead and checked S0 PGOOD on <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> and ALL SYS PWRGD is only measuring .52V with all voltages going in good. I have swapped out 7950 twice and it would turn on occassionally but then not wake from sleep or just die randomly. All resistors around <TRANSISTOR>Q7950</TRANSISTOR> are measuring good. I am not sure what to check next as this unit only turns on occassionally. If i disconnect and reattach the magsafe plug extremely fast I can usually get it to power up. There is no corrosion on the board whatosoever."
