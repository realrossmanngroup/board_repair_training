Green light on charger. Is able to charge battery. I have checked ALL voltages and they are all good. No short to ground on any power lines. I then went ahead and checked S0 PGOOD on Q7950 and ALL SYS PWRGD is only measuring .52V with all voltages going in good. I have swapped out 7950 twice and it would turn on occassionally but then not wake from sleep or just die randomly. All resistors around Q7950 are measuring good. I am not sure what to check next as this unit only turns on occassionally. If i disconnect and reattach the magsafe plug extremely fast I can usually get it to power up. There is no corrosion on the board whatosoever."}
