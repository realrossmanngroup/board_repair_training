        "message":"Hi i have a 820-3330-B With water damage, it wont power on and only has a green light. I have checked the u6901 pin 4=3.26mv pin A & B= 3.26mv pin 5= 3.4mv & u6900 pin 4=3.72mv pin 1 =3.27mv c6908=3.4mv.  is the dip in mv from 3.72 to 3.27 and 3.4mv a problem?  im going to keep digging into this. any help is appreciated \nThanks\nNate"
