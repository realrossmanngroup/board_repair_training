The customer said that it had no backlight, but when I try and turn it on its totally dead. Im presuming this model runs fine off the charger with a flat battery ?.\nThis thing is pretty much out of the ark, so its quite different to the newer boards I have been repairing so far.\nI see this model doesnt seem to have a ISL chip on it, does it just have the SMC that deals with all of the power etc ?"}

Start by measuring the basic 3v42 PPBUS etc. Also does it turn on from just the charger no battery plugged in? If not, tried known good DC in board? MUST use 85 Watt Mag 1 btw 60 watt won't work."}
