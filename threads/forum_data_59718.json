An <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> came to my workshop that only turned on with a battery and when I connected the magsafe and the green LED blinked, change <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and measuring it had no <SIGNAL>PP5V1_CHGR_VDDP</SIGNAL>\nremove <RESISTOR>R7001</RESISTOR> and got green light then orange\nreplace <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> and fix that fault.\nnow when I connect with a charged battery it says the battery is exhausted and it does not turn on, then I connect the magsafe and with the battery connected it marks a level of 60% and it works very slow. From already thank you very much"
