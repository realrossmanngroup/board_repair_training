        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",

            "message": "Hello! My costomer brought in a mac and complain, that two left side ports won’t charge anymore and only one right side port is working (upper one). Amp meter wasn’t even lighting up on left side ports, upper right port was working fine (switching to 20V, charging), bottom right was disconnecting all the time. I have discovered corrosion (but no water damage, looked like oxydation) arround all 4 USB-C controllers, some damaged resistors and traces. I have rebuilt traces, replaced resistors, resoldered all 4 controllers. After that left side ports started communicating with charger but board will not switch to 20V anymore on any port. The right side bottom port is still disconnecting constantly. I have already replaced all controllers with full working and tested ones - the behaviour is the same. The only activity is clicking trackpad. \n\nBasic measurements: \n[LIST]\n[*]<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12,26V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3,3V\n[*]<SIGNAL>PP1V8_AWAKE</SIGNAL> - 1,8V\n[*]All LDO lines of USB-C controllers are present\n[*]Thermal camera doesn’t show any obvious shorts\n[*]traces around UB260/<CHIP>U3060</CHIP> are OK (had to rebuild trace from pin number two of UB260 to RB298/293/262/29C)\n[*]SSD supply lines are not present, but there are no shorts\n[/LIST]\nI have tried DFU revive. Device is recognised in DFU but can’t be revived, because Apple Configurator can’t connect to SSD I guess.. \n\nWith thermal camera I have noticed, that when I connect charger to looping port, <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> is flashing for a half of second around pins nr. 8,19,20,27. I have replaced that chip, but it’s the same.."
