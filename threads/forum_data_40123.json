            "message": "Hi guys I have an 3476 with liquid damage at <CAPACITOR>C7622</CAPACITOR> the line was burned. I wired it to <CAPACITOR>C7624</CAPACITOR>. Still there was a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING</SIGNAL>. I found <TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> a bit hotter then the rest and replaced it. The short circuit is gone and instead 1.2v I get 12.56v on PPBUS. Now the board is power cycling. Vcore goes up to 1V and back to 0 and so is <SIGNAL>5V_S0</SIGNAL> at fan. Could this be related to the liquid? It was only a bit on one spot and the board looks quite OK in general. Any chance that the CPU can be fried as well here? Checked <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> and ROM area looks quite clean and voltage is there 3.3v and 3.42v.\n\nEdit: found a short in 1.05 circuit, removed <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> but that didnt remove the short. Rest of components look pretty OK. Since its a low voltage line I figured I better not pump power through it to find the short. Any things I should be checking here?"
