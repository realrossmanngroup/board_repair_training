Replaced those components and diode measurement was still at .300 on <SIGNAL>PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC</SIGNAL>. So I reflowed the SMC and diode measurement is now @ .475 on <SIGNAL>PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC</SIGNAL>.  Green light is back and board turns on. Only thing is that it turns off while booting to ssd and may or may not turn back on right away. This occurs with AC or Battery power. The last time this occured I hit the board with some hot air and it turned on. This however could just be coincidence. Looks like I will be doing some more measuring in tha AM. Thanks for your help, its greatly appreciated guys."
