The rest of the board looks clean, no corrosion.\n<CHIP>U8900</CHIP> area looked pretty bad so I have decided to rebuild it swapping all the nasty components.\nI did also swap <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> from a donor board.\n\nOnce powered on, I could hear something clicking. It was <TRANSISTOR>Q8930</TRANSISTOR>.\nI have now removed it, checked for short and put another in place.\n\nBoard is turning on, chime, will respond to PRAM but no GPUVcore whatsoever.\nI've double checked every resistor around <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and they all measure fine.\n\nI am missing the enable signal on pin38 coming from the GMux chip.\nSo I am now confused in where to start. Should I be getting an enable signal even if <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> is bad or not?\nIt's not even pulsing."
