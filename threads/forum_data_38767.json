Board looks visually clean with the usual dust here and there, no liquid damage to be seen.\n\nAre these boards prone to any GPU failures? Is there something else I should be looking for?\n\nI don't get a display on an external monitor but to be honest I'm not using the best of adapters to test this with (don't often deal with the newer Macbooks so don't have a lot of kit to test with!).\n\nCheers guys"
