            "message": "So we got a mpb 17 with this board.\nAt first the machine would not even start. By watching multiple videos where Luis addresses this issue I was speculating immediately that the \"classic\" <CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR> cap issue will be the problem. \nMeasured voltage on it, it was 0.3V. Changed the cap to a non tantulum one.\nThe machine would start up. It seemed that we fixed it but when the owner came back and installed own ssd and optibay the machine would turn itself off just after boot.\nWhen we try to boot from external hdd it works. Also tried connecting multiple usb devices that suck power but it would work fine. But when we boot with the hard drive installed in still shuts down every now and then.\n\nAnother issue that might be connected is that the screen will turn itself off quite oftenly. Tried felxing the motherboard just in the area above the fan where the vRams are and the screen would go on and off.\nMeasured all rails, everything seems normal.\nNo idea where to look next.\nThanks for the help"
