Before working on the board it did get 20V and appeared to be booting. After replacing surrounding affected components board got stuck at 5v. All LDO voltages present.  Replaced U3100 to rule out but no change.\nPP3V3_G3H fluctuates around .500v-.900v C3200 however it appears everywhere else on the board 3.3V\n\nWhat could be causing 3.3v to flucuate only on c3200? No short to ground and already replaced C3200"}
