I needed to format it, I went through the whole process and left it until it was finished, when I went to check the machine it no longer showed an image with any other screen, it turns on, however, there is no chime, and its consumption is around 1,200 mA, any tips on where start evaluating, taking into account that it was functional.\n\nI have some skill with electronics and maintenance and I followed everything carefully with the process on this MacBook, but the failure occurred during the system installation."
