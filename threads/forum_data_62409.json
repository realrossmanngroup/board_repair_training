Description from customer [I]\"no more reaction. Water damage - the device was for a short time submerged in water\"[\/I].\n\nAfter fixing all the damaged areas finally PP3V3_S0 was missing. I changed U7650 to fix this.\nThe board have 20V and uses at the beginning ca. 485mA, going up to ca. 600mA when the cpu-temperature get's up. The CPU gets warm, up to 55\u00b0C (needs ca. 1-2 minutes) measured on top of the cpu-cooler.\nThe board does not boot - chipmunk don't show any cpu-activity.
