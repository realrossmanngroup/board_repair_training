I believe it had this issue before I changed the battery though also. \n\nIt sometimes restarts during boot or just randomly will freeze and restart. Sometimes I can burn up the battery without a freeze or restart. Hardware test shows no issues. I\u2019ve done restore via configurator, reloaded, pram and smc resets. Think this is a memory issues? I notice that when you force Mac off by holding down the power button it spins up the fans real quick just before it powers off. I don\u2019t have history on the Mac. It wouldn\u2019t boot when I got it. It had IC getting hot between the cd3215s q3100 I believe. I thought was exacerbated by dgpu but video works on all ports."}

I think more likely to crash while charging than when just battery. Is there any reason you can think of that would make sense? Something in charging circuit \/ voltage fluctuation occasionally causing kernel panic or something?"}

I have yet to see it happen with battery only or with charger on right side as of recent anyway. Today I was able to get it to freeze twice by having charger in either left side port and external on right side simply switching between mirror and extended display ~12 times. Now it isn't freezing up no matter what I try. I ran external display, Valley x 2 and moved display cord and charger cords around in different orientations and it won't freeze up again. It does still ramp up fan real quick before it shuts off if I hold down power key.\n\nGfxcardstatus won't allow me to force to integrated. It lets me select it but then it shows it is on the discrete. The only time I see its running integrated is when it is doing it automatically\/naturally at dynamic state."}

Well in regards to my case, I buried the MacBook for 20 plus hours and it hasn't frozen or crashed but it does still spin fans up if you force it off which gives me good reason to believe it still has issue. Any advice? I think the battery I got from IG isn't the best and going to try one today from MS just to see but seems like the board has some nagging issue."}
