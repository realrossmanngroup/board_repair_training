I changed the U7100,R7105,R7096 and the green light came on, then I inserted the battery and the device turned on.\nthen i collected the device and it won't turn on. It charges but the amperage drops backwards. first current 2.15 - 2.14- 2.10 - 2.05 -1.90 counting downward current starts to decrease now there is orange light but it does not turn on\n\nPPBUS_G3H : 8.16 voltage\nPP3V42_G3H : 3.4 Voltage\nMC_BC_ACOK : 3.3Voltage\n\nPP1V05_SUS: 1.0 voltage\nSMC_RESET_L : 2.8 voltage\nPCH_SRTCRST_L : 2.8 voltage\nPCH_INTRUDER_L : 2.6Voltage\n\nI don't know where to look now"}
