If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

Last week costumer brought it back with a strange symptom. If the machine is left off for about 10 minutes it starts one time. No matter if you leave it on for 5 seconds or 1 hour, if you shut it down it won't power again immediately. If I leave it sitting on the bench for some minutes it turns on again for one time and does the same. When it stops working I have quarter fan spin. All S0 coils pulse during the quarter fan except the CPU VCORE ones. Any ideas?"
