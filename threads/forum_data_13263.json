SMC_BC_ACOK is measuring about 0.05V. I replaced a missing C7120 and replaced U7100. I've measured all the resistors around U7100 and they are measuring fine. Usually just taking care of the basics will get this solved. Not sure what else I need to get this going. Areas of minor corrosion can be seen in pics."}

No change. After the first replacement I noticed that C7092 was shorted so I replaced C7092, C7091, C7090 and U7090. I have 0.8V on PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H. Not sure how that interacts with U7100 and ACOK, but I've been working under the assumption that I should be able to get ACOK with just a functional U7100 circuit."}

Yeah, I was thinking I could get ACOK going and then work on 3V42. Apparently not. Replaced R7020 that was measuring correct resistance but not allowing voltage through. Done. Working. Thanks."}
