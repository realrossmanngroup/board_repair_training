But it boots normally without KB and TP. External KB and mouse works fine. I also checked with new Topcase with new KB and TP but still same issue.\n\nThere is no liquid damage on the board, looks very neat and clean. I have also checked the J4501 and J4500 diode mode reading couldn't find any clue. compared these diode mode reading with known good working machine which was normal.\n\nplease suggest me where to start and what i am missing."}
