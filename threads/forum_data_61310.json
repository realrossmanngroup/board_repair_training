The board is clean, no history of liquid damage. \n\nAlready replaced <CHIP>U9800</CHIP>, SMC, PCH and still same problem.\n\nIt will work if I turn off Automatic switching / energy/ system pref. So it will wake if run on the discrete GPU, but will not wake if run on CPU.\n\nI was thinking of replacing discrete GPU, but it seems more of a Intel GPU side. I'm not sure,  please help.  Thanks"
