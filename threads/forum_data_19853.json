            "message": "[PLAIN][SOLVED] <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00138</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> Water damage turns on shows battery indicator on screen then shuts down[/PLAIN]\n\nHi guys, working on a 2015 retina that has water damage spill around battery area and trackpad. But before i start replacing parts, i want to get the board working so i removed the board from the unit tested it with the lcd and i get the same problem, it shows battery charging indicator on screen and shuts down as if it sees a battery attached and its dead. So as we know no brd view is available i have no idea where the pull ups are for the data line going to the smc on the board. I managed to test the current sensing resistors around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and are within specs. There are no signs of water near the smc, also i did an smc bypass unit chimes and boots fine which could mean the smc is bad but i want to make sure the smc is not being tricked that the battery is dead from something else on the board. Any idea where i can find <RESISTOR>R5380</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5381</RESISTOR> on the board without the board view?"
