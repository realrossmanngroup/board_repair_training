Replaced  everything but still no power. TP from PPVOUT_S0_PCH_DCPRTC was nearly destroyed. Attempted to jumper from what was left of that to C0805 but no change.\n\nAny other ideas to try or is this a no fix since signal comes from PCH? I do not see anywhere else on the board view to run a jumper to."}
