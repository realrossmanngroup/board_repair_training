It refuses to boot either one of the two accounts, with filevault enabled, but will boot into Guest mode. I have also made several attempts in connecting the drive via Target disk mode. The machine successfully enters Target disk mode but is not able to connect by USB to any of the four USB-C ports. I have tried two different machines with two different cables. If I boot off external drive (10.13 High Sierra) the machine only stays alive for 30 seconds after entering desktop. The screen goes black and about a minute later it reboots. I believe the drive is failing and was hoping someone had success with data recovery...\n\nError report:\n\npanic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff7f9cb594a7): nvme: \"Fatal error occurred.
