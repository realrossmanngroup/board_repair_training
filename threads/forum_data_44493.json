        "message":"What is the best way to make data backup from a macbook air SSD, which is working, it has like 45gb files, and it looks like most them are good, readable, but there is maybe 1000 bad files, like music or whatever files, so probably i can copy like 95% of all the data, but the finder always stops and i have to figure out which file is not good, and start copy withtout it, but when i have loads of bad files that takes forever, so in Windows i use Robocopy and Total commander, Robocopy is really nice freeware, and i can set it that after 1 fail it should just skip to the next file, but how can i do that with a MAcbook air ssd which is formatted as HSF?"
