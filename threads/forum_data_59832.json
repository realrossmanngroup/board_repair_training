Seems like came in most near display control connector of course. \n\nSome noticeable stuff in near u7100 at r7100, c7100. on other side of board around one side of u7220. Customer noted display started discoloring in one corner before it was shut down.\n\nPPBUS G3H is 13V\nALL_SYS_PWRGD - 0V\nPP5V_S4 shows voltage going to zero. Diode here to ground is .295V\n\n\nFrom what I've seen here in forums this board CPU often gets overvoltage w\/liquid damage. I don't want to waste a lot of time on this as it if it is low probability fix.\n\nSOme quick things to check?"}

No sign of liquid or shorting on pins. Another shop tried drying it out for customer. They must've been in the mac because one of the cable pull tabs was missing. So I don't know if they cleaned the board connectors at all. I don't think so or I would think they would have seen residue in spots on the board.\n\nPin 1 diode= 0.264V\nPin 3 diode= 0.268V\n\nHere is a summary of areas where there was liquid residue:\nC\/R7100\/1\nU7220\nC7210 to C8006"}

SMC_Lid is steady 3V w TrackPad connected. It now starts with TP connected most of the time although one fan seems to be a bit wonky or slower than the other with the TPad connected. I tried reflashing the firmware a couple of times. When plugged into external display the display goes black. USB-C to external drive still not showing any data activity. With speaker plugged in and charger, I hear the chirp related to power from the speaker. CPU gets warm. It really does seem like it is trying to boot or partially booting.\n\nWondering if I should try SMC if I can source one? I had mostly written this one off but when I get time, I try a few things as it seems like there COULD be hope for this board."}
