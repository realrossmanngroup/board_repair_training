I am getting 0 volts.\n\nAfter leaving the battery disconnected a while and reconnecting, the little juice which was left in the battery allowed for a very brief on time, showing the battery low symbol, and the power LED was on without being plugged.\n\nAs a test I plugged in a normal usbc 5v charger and I get the power light on, and I get voltages through the motherboard. However its not enough to charge an extremely dead battery. The screen did show the charging symbol but I think was not enough power to charge and drained the battery completely.\n\nI know that the motherboard and charger need to negotiate the power (5v or 14.5v), it seems like it knows to turn off 5v, but somehow unable to turn on 14.5v, unlike the common stuck on 5v issue.\n\nI\u2019ve checked for shorts, i cannot see anything obvious, nothing getting hot, but no LED light, no power in any rails.\n\nAnyone have any experience on something similar?\n\nAll help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance."}

Checking the power output from the charger through the port (disconnected from the mother board) i still get 0 volts through +VBUS line on USBc, I am assuming the charger gives 0 volts until it knows which power to switch to? \n\nCould it be the charger is not \"detecting\" its being connected to something?"}
