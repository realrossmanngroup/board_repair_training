Owner said it was running fine the previous day and all of sudden won't power up.\nI've checked the board for corrosion or sign of spill, none.\nThe board does get warm with PP20 present and about 70mA of current draw. I've flashed new ME as well with the same result. Any suggestions on where to start looking on this one?"}
