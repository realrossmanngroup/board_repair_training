        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "CPUVR_SW1": "What is CPUVR_SW1? a SIGNAL.",
        "CPUVR_SW2": "What is CPUVR_SW2? a SIGNAL.",
        "PLT_RST_L": "What is PLT_RST_L? This is an abbreviation of “PLT_RESET_L” – when you see “PLT_RST_L\", assume the person meant to type PLT_RESET_L.",
        "SMC_LID_LEFT": "What is SMC_LID_LEFT? SMC_LID_LEFT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the left LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_LEFT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
        "LID_OPEN": "What is LID_OPEN? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_LID_RIGHT": "What is SMC_LID_RIGHT? SMC_LID_RIGHT is a signal that tells the system if the lid is closed from the right LID sensor. If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_RIGHT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",
        "HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT": "What is HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT? HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT is a signal from the hall sensor on the RIGHT side of the machine that indicates that the lid has been closed. This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen."
