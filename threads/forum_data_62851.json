Received it with only little info. little corrosion around u7000 Fixed it easy. Was booting fine but very slow hihg CPU usage while Idle. Checked all set sensors nothing missing or no high temps. After another cleaning with flux around the u7000. Now won't boot. I checked all the power rails.\n\nUSB-C amp  20v up to 0,4a than steady 0,05a\nAll there even\nALL_SYS_PWRGD 1,8 v after 10 sec back to 0v\nPM_PCH_SYS_PWROK\n\nBut no\nPPVCC_S0_CPU 0v\n\nChecked for corrosion around u7220 and u7210. looks clean. \n\nWhat can It be?"}

Maybe we can troubleshoot back. \n\nWhere does PPVCC_S0_cpu come from? U7220 and U7210. Both are supplied with PPBUS_HS_CPU \nWhat is needed for u7220\/u7210 to create PPVCC_S0_cpu?? \n\nCould it be that only 1 Phase se was supplied before and that was the reason of the slow cpu? Not enough power? I can't find much about this subs that's whyI'm thinking out of the box...\n\nThis in advance"}
