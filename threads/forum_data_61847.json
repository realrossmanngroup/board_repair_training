No short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> (at this time). \nRemoved all caps <CAPACITOR>C6996</CAPACITOR>/5/7/8/<CAPACITOR>C6988</CAPACITOR>/9, but short still there.\nDecided to remove <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR>. Then no short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_VR</SIGNAL> (happy) but now <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is shorted ! (around 0.002 on diode mode)e\n\nResoldering L6995, plug-in USB-C charger => 5v017 on charger, 0.00 amp, but <SIGNAL>PP3V3_GH3_VR</SIGNAL> now present (3.42 Volts). \nResoldering <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> (the real mistake?) but nothing else. No short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_VR</SIGNAL> (Pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> shows 3.42 volts) but sill present on pin 2. I suppose resistance can isolate a short, because nothing is connected to the ground.\n\nRemoving <CAPACITOR>C7080</CAPACITOR> on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> (the most easier before thinking at <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>) and... nothing more. I decided to leave the board beside.\n\nThis morning, i plug the charger to make new tests, and, without touching nothing since the last day, charge stays at 5v017 but amp drop from 0.3 to 1.8A ! Nasty smell around <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>... touching in the zone and burning my finger on Cap <CAPACITOR>C3100</CAPACITOR>... Damned !\n\nCharger pulling down to 0.6 amp and 4.7 volts on first usb-c port, stay around this values and, around 5v017 and 0,3 amp on other port...\n\nSo i decide to take the voltage of <SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> => 5,17 volts !! how it's possible !\n\nI decided to remove <CAPACITOR>C3100</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C3200</CAPACITOR>, and <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Unfortunatly there still a short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>, and now another on the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_UPC_XA</SIGNAL> and XB. \n\nSo i remove the <RESISTOR>R3000</RESISTOR> and 3001, one by one.\n\nShort is gone on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_UPC_XA</SIGNAL> and XB, so i suppose <CHIP>U3000</CHIP> & <CHIP>U3001</CHIP> chips are fines.\n\nBut short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is still there !\n\nI remove <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> to be sure again, but no difference...\n\nAlso tested keyboard connector who looks perfect, nothing special.\n\nHowever, values are below :\n\nResistance from pin 15 to ground => around 2,6 ohms\nResistance from pin 16 to ground => around 0,9 ohms (same as shorting my multimeter)\nResistance from <RESISTOR>R6999</RESISTOR> (pin 2) to ground => around 2,6 ohms\n\nSo Pins 15 & 16 aren't shorted together, connector seems fine.\n\nA idea for the nexts steps (without more destruction?)\n\nthanks a lot for your help"
