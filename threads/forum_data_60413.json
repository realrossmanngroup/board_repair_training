        "message":"I have an 820-00923-A that is showing the battery charging icon in a loop. All 4 ports are pulling 19.7 volts. I've replaced the battery with a new one and still the same result. Tried SMC reset multiple times. The same thing will also happen with or without the battery plugged in (including without the battery sense flex plugged in as well), except it will loop once then turn off, until you press the power button then it will do one battery icon charging loop then turn off again. No signs of liquid damage. Did a quick check on diode mode readings on some of the LDOs on the CD3215s and all diode mode readings seemed similar, around .470ish. Checked SCL and SDA lines on battery sense flex connector and they both showed 3.4 volts in a looping fashion in accordance with the battery charging icon showing on the screen.\n\nAny help would be appreciated on this."

        "message":"Figured I should close out this thread. I ended up watching this video by Louis - [MEDIA=youtube]AgLgY6X0mKs[\/MEDIA] where he received an  820-00923-A from another shop that was turning on but wasn't charging the battery. I ended up taking 2informaticos advice above and used both an 87W original and 61W original charger. In both cases the laptop would turn on but show the battery percentage at 1%. The laptop would then turn off after a few minutes. After watching Louis's video I realized how the circuit worked, and that I, like the shop in the video, was \"Koala-ing\" myself. All it ended up being was a defective original battery and a defective battery that I purchased on Amazon. I ended up purchasing another battery off Mobile Sentrix and Q7065 (the transistor responsible for allowing the battery to charge began opening up again - with the defective battery it had 13.05 volts on the gate, the same voltage as PPBUS_G3Hot on the source. With the good battery it dropped down to about 4.2 volts on the gate and allowed the battery to charge). Thanks for your help 2informaticos and Louis. I was simply \"Koala-ing\" after all haha."
