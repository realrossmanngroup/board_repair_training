            "message": "This board is a potential refurb for a business client. The only history I have on it is that the screen is cracked and that there is \"No Display\". Upon further investigating the unit gets a green light and fan spin but does not POST. The computer spins up runs for about 30 seconds and then spins down and repeats over and over again. The computer does have proper 8.58 V PPBUS and has 1.75 VCORE. The VCORE rail cycles with the fan spinning. When the computer is spun up and VCORE is high, there is no light on a USB mouse or keyboard. No signs of liquid damage or previous repair. The CPU gets warm but not alarmingly hot."
