Tiniest amount of liquid corroded <RESISTOR>R5014</RESISTOR>, so I replaced it.\n5. Replaced SMC, <CHIP>U5010</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7941</CHIP>, as well as the clock, as I've seen those all cause similar issues in the past.\n6. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is steady at ~12.10v with battery, no bouncing, but the board does not power on with battery.\n\nI was going to replace <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, but it would just be a guess at this point; I have a feeling that the cause is earlier in the power line, as it's affecting all of these down-the-line rails. I thought for sure replacing the SMC would resolve it, but it doesn't. PP3v42 is steady (no bouncing), and it's steady at <CHIP>U5010</CHIP>.\n\nAny ideas where I should check next?

I wanted to check if the board charged a battery, and when I plug in the charger, the BIL illuminates, but it does NOT respond to being pressed. This is definitely looking like a case of the SMC being in a wrong mode."

It lights up when charger is connected/disconnected, but does not work when the button is pressed. Charger also never turns orange with a half-charged battery."

Chip replacement went well, as usual, and behavior is 100% identical. I think I can firmly rule out the SMC in this case. This is the 3rd chip that's been on the board, and every time the behavior goes completely unchanged. \n\nI replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, simply because I saw that <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is connected, and wanted to make sure I tried everything related to <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET</SIGNAL>. No change.\n\nI did want to update the thread with more information, as some of it is new and/or has changed:\n\n- Charger light flickers ever so slightly (solid green light the whole time, just indication of power attempting to stabilize), which is common with this type of issue from what I've experienced.\n- BIL DOES work after all. After some back-and-forth on this, and me deciding to try a new BIL assembly, I get a working BIL with battery connected. This has been convoluted, but there is BIL function (when I said it \"worked once\", that was due to a faulty assembly after all, and not a board/SMC function issue).\n- have replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, SMC, <CHIP>U5010</CHIP>, Clock, <CHIP>U7941</CHIP>.\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is stable at 3.44v\n- <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> fluctuates from 12.1 - 12.6\n- <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is stable at 3.42v\n- <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> is stable at 3.44v\n- <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> is not stable at all--fluctuates from .9v to 1.8v, etc., so I guess the board is thinking the power button is being pressed over and over?\n- Keyboard connector looks fine\n- <RESISTOR>R1985</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R2585</RESISTOR>, and <RESISTOR>R2502</RESISTOR> all check out fine.\n\nSounding like it may be a PCH issue at this point. Would it be worth sending this thing through the ultrasonic as a last ditch effort? Maybe something underneath the PCH?\n\nI'll call it quits on this board after one more reply from you duke, as I don't want to take up a ton of time with one thread.
