When I replaced these I started getting 5v and 0.340A. I can't seem to get any further than this and have gotten a bit confused in the process, I can't remeber exactly what lead me to <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> as this was about a month ago while waiting for new chips but <CHIP>U9080</CHIP> was shorting to ground. \n\nVoltages:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: 5.02V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>: 0.00V \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL>: 0.00V\n\nNo short to ground that I can find anywhere, no visible damage, no liquid damage. \n\nAny help is massivly appriciated."
