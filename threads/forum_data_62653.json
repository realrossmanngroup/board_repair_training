When I replaced these I started getting 5v and 0.340A. I can't seem to get any further than this and have gotten a bit confused in the process, I can't remeber exactly what lead me to U7000 as this was about a month ago while waiting for new chips but U9080 was shorting to ground. \n\nVoltages:\n\nPPBUS_G3H: 5.02V\nPP3v3_G3H: 0.00V \nPP3v3_G3H_RTC: 0.00V\n\nNo short to ground that I can find anywhere, no visible damage, no liquid damage. \n\nAny help is massivly appriciated."}

This is where I'm still new to everything and to what to do next, If i put one probe on F7000 G3H and one on R7020 pin 2, PPDCIN_G3h_ChGR I get a short (a beep)."}
