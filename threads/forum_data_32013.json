        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."

            "message": "I have this machine that had liquid damage in the area of the lcd connector and thunderbolt ports. The connector looks fine and I have ultrasonic'd the board already. The machine turns on and chimes but I get no backlight. When I shine a flashlight I can see an image on the screen. I have tried a PRAM reset but that did not work. I thought the LCD cable might have been the issue so I tried with another cable plugged in but still no backlight. \n\nOn backlight output at the LCD connector I get 0v. On pins 3/4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> I get 12.56v and 12.44v but 0v on the output pins 1/2/5/6. <RESISTOR>R7701</RESISTOR>/2 measure proper resistance. <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.4v\nI replaced <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> but that still did not solve the issue.\n\nI don't have another display assembly that I can test this with so is there anything I can check for to figure out why there is no backlight?"
