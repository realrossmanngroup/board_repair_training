The connector looks fine and I have ultrasonic'd the board already. The machine turns on and chimes but I get no backlight. When I shine a flashlight I can see an image on the screen. I have tried a PRAM reset but that did not work. I thought the LCD cable might have been the issue so I tried with another cable plugged in but still no backlight. \n\nOn backlight output at the LCD connector I get 0v. On pins 3\/4 of Q7706 I get 12.56v and 12.44v but 0v on the output pins 1\/2\/5\/6. R7701\/2 measure proper resistance. SMC_LID is 3.4v\nI replaced U7701 but that still did not solve the issue.\n\nI don't have another display assembly that I can test this with so is there anything I can check for to figure out why there is no backlight?"}
