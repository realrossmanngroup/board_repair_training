I got this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that came in with fainted green light at MagSafe. It had a short on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> & <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. I was able to relieve the short on <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> by removing <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>. Now I have solid green light but I still have a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPBAT_G3H_CONN</SIGNAL>. Please note that I still haven't switched <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>. I tried to inject some voltage but I wasn't able to find a component that gets hot. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks!"
