Lots of variables here...you need to rule them all out. \"Known-good\" displays--how do you know they work? Do they work with ANY 3536\/3476 boards, OR do they work with any 4924 boards? This shouldn't be hard to figure out. Again, probably a 2015 display."}

Under the assumption I would get these working I loaded some drives using external display and the backlight came on. Still no image but the mac seems to see the display is there in the settings also. I'll post back once i've had a chance to try firmware."}
