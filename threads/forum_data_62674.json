Its a 4 USB port MacBook and strangely I'm getting 20v and some current (0.40A before going back to 0A) and on the other side, i'm getting 5v 0.24A constant and on the other 5v 0.24v boot loop.\n\nCould this be the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> which isn't boot looping or as there is a current on the 5v port, be the ROM?\n\nThanks"

I don't want to go down the hole of changing the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s when it could be the ROM which is at fault. So from your expertise knowledge do you think it's the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s (on the 5v non-boot loop) or the ROM.
