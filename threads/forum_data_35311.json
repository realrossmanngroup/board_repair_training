            "message": "Hi.<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, no liquid. Would power up then shut down almost instantly.\nFound that <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> was missing and <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> wasnt putting out voltage to FETs. I replaced <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> and all HS FETS. After this, computer booted into OS. Then I checked VCORE and found it was fluctuating between .75V and 1.1V. After this fans got high and computer shut down. Now back to square one, computer shuts down almost instantly. Fans spin no Vcore.\n\nPPBUS and <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5</SIGNAL> are 12.56V.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_CPUIMVP_VCC</SIGNAL> - 5V\n\n6 Ohms on <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL>\n\nThanks. Have a good one.\n\nUpdate - \n\nChanged <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>, FETS and surrounding components again. Booted again for about 6 minutes with CPUVCORE at .75V then powered off. PPBUS was shorted to ground on <TRANSISTOR>Q7530</TRANSISTOR>. Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7530</TRANSISTOR> PPBUS short is gone. Now its in a power loop with 1.1V on VCORE............  Now Dead CPU, I'm assuming?"
