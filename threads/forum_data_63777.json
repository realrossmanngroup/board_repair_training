No Apple logo no boot. Here are some voltages:\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8,70V\nPP3V3_G3H = 3,30V\nPPDCIN_G3H = 19,7V\nPP3V3R3V0_AON = 3,3V\nPP5V_G3H = 5,1V\nPP5V_S4 = 5,1V\nPP5V_S0 = 5,1\nPP3V3_S5 = 3,3V\nPP3V3_SUS = 3,3 V\nPP3V3_S4 = 3,3 V\nPP3V3_S0 = 3,3V\nPP1V8_SUS = 1,8V\nPP1V8_S3 = 1,8V\nPP1V5_S0 = 1,5V\n\nI found out that PPVCORE_S0_CPU = 0V \/ 10,5ohms. Checked this with a 2017er MacBook resistance is same but 0,635V. So I have checked:\n\nVCIN of U7210 and U7230 = 5,10V\nVIN of U7210 and U7230 = 8,70V\n\nZCD_EN = 0V = CPUCORE_FCCM\n\nCPUCORE_FCCM is produced by U7100\n\nVIN of U7100 = 8,7V\nVCC of U7100 = 5,1V\n\nI don't see an enable pin for U7100. Schematics says for VIN 12,9V I got 8,7V, maybe this is problem or bad U7100? Or something else?\n\ncheers"}

Noticed that there are 2 kinds of chips. Didn't got the original one, but it is possible to turn the chip 90\u00b0 and it is ok. So now the situation is, that I got no voltages. The only voltage I get is the PPDCIN 5V 3mA. Looks like Q3100 or U3100 is faulty, but why now? This board is driving me crazy...\n\nQ3100:\nGate 1= 10,80V\nGate 2 = 6,90V\n\nI do not understand why the gate have more voltage that the incoming voltage?"}

Also Alixpress sales this as the same. This chip I bought 5pcs was sold as the rom for A1534. What I have tried now is multiple times changed the chip, erased sold again, nothing changed. Also tried power without this chip, same behaviour. I don't how is the behaviour of a mainboard without the rom, but I think it should also without the rom switch to 20V or not?"}
