        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "P3V3S5_EN_L": "What is P3V3S5_EN_L? P3V3S5_EN_L is a signal that enables the power chip responsible for creating PP3V3_S5 when it is low. .",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",
