(is this voltage should be showing when laptop is powered of or when is power on? i dont understand with rails are showing when laptop is on or off.)\nPP5V_S0 - 0.00v   (also this one ?)\nPP3V3_S5 - 3.33v\nPP3V3_S4 -3.33v\nPP3V3_SUS - 3.33v\nPP3V3_S3 - 0.04v\nPP3V3_S0 - 0.03v\nnot sure if i should continue measurements more ?\nanybody can help me ? Thank you in advance"}
