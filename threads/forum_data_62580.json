When I plug in the MagSafe the backlight and LCD go out (I am guessing it goes in sleep mode). Unplug the charger and it’s back up. Also good to note that there is no light on the MagSafe.\n\nI have tried a new I/o board and connecting flex.\n\nCan someone help me with which lines I can start checking?"
