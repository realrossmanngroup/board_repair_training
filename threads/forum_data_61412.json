        "message":"I have this board that was severely liquid damaged around U7800 and the trackpad connector was burnt. I replaced U7800 and the components around it and also had to dig out a short on PPBUS in the board by the trackpad connector. I cleared the short and replaced the trackpad connector and ran wires for all the broken traces on the trackpad connector. Now the board turns on and seem to work fine. I was able to install big sur on the internal SSD and was using it for a few hours without any issues. Then I turned it off and when I went to turn it back on again, it gave me a flashing folder icon. I turned it off an back on again and now this time it boots fine. It seems to randomly lose connection to the SSD now. Most of the time, it will boot fine, but sometimes it will give me a flashing folder when I turn it on. I checked J9600 and it did have some small amount of dirt on it. I cleaned it and replaced the plate, but same issue. I checked the voltages and I have all the correct voltages on pins 4, 6, 12, 14, and 44 of J9600 when the board boots to the SSD. When I get the flashing folder icon, I have all the voltages expect for pin 14 for SSD_CLKREQ_LB_L. That voltage is 0v when it gives me a flashing folder and then 3.3v when it works. That signal comes from U8605, so is it safe to assume that chip is faulty, or is there something else that could cause this like the SMC?"

SSD_RESET_LB_L is 3.27v steady also and it has the _L on the end. I ran diagnostics and it only reports error PPF004, there may be an issue with the fan, but the fans seem fine. I have also noticed that when the battery is not connected, I cannot start the board using just a 87w charger. It will turn on and display a low battery symbol and then turn off. If I try it without the battery and use a 96w charger instead, it does turn on and boot using just that charger. I am pretty sure it should be able to turn on using the 87w charger only. All the other 15\" boards I have worked on turn on using the 87w. Also, I noticed I can get it to boot to the internal SSD every time if I disconnect it from power completely (disconnect both charger and battery) and then reconnect it to power. The first time it boots after that, it always works, then won't work if you reboot with power still connected."

        "message":"I put this board to the side to work on some other things, but now I am trying to fix this one again. I was comparing diode mode values on this board vs a good board and found that U4540, U3760, and U3770 were bad. I replaced those and now my diode mode reading match my good board and I seem to be able to reboot the board without any SSD issues now. The problem seems to be now when the computer goes to sleep. If I close the lid with it on, the fan will stop spinning after a few seconds, as if it is sleeping, but the amps on my USB meter are cycling from 0.03a up to 1.4a, as if it is rebooting itself. This is without the battery connected of course. If I open the screen again, it still shows me logged into my desktop, and does not go to the login screen like normal. If you leave it closed long enough, the fans will slowly start to speed up until they are at max and if you open the screen during this time, it will show a flashing folder icon. After I reboot it, it works fine again, with normal fan speed. What should I check for this kind of issue?"
