After removing a shorted capacitor (C7651), I get PPDCIN_G3H at 20V, PPBUS_G3H at 12.3V, and PP3V3_G3H at 3.3V.\n\nI tried a DFU firmware restore which showed an error the very end (\u201cThe System cannot be restored on this device.\u201d), presumably because the machine cannot start up.\n\nWhat can I troubleshoot to show why PPBUS_G3H fails to go to 12.6V?"}
