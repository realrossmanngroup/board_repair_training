        "message":"Hello,\nthis 820-3437 was waterdamaged. Trackpad and Keyboard wont work and it did not see the battery. I followed the schematic and (it was cleaned before i got it) replaced the SMC because the ISL looks fine and the Pull ups on the dataline are good. Now it sees the battery, charges it and works without charger, but still no keyboard and Trackpad. I checked R5390 and R5391 ant they are fine. Without the cable connected to J4800 (must it be connected to troubleshoot this?) i checked that TPAD_SPI_IF_EN and TPAD_USB_IF_EN are not there. I am not sure if they have to be there... With an USB Keyboard it works. (As far as i know Keyboard is connected to USB internally and the external USB ports work...) I tried another Trackpad and the same. Now i am stuck.\nThanks for any help."
