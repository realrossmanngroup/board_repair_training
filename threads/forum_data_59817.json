CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",
