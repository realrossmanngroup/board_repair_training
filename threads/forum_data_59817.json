Re-Installed MacOS which took more time than normal, it seems that the machine is very slow.  Held down 'D' to run diag on boot but MacOS reports no issues found: Code App0000.\n\n      Also, when turning on the machine it's necessary to hold down the power button until the chime completes to get the boot going.\n\n      Eventually installed 'istat menus' and the it's showing the 'Kernel Task' @ 244%."}
