The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",

Replaced both as part of the initial clean up pass. No other signs of any corrosion/junk anywhere else.\n\n[B]Symptoms[/B]\n\nBoard behaves, randomly, in different ways when power is applied.\n\n1) Powers on drawing either 0.180, 0.200, or 0.250 amps, fan spins, fan goes off and it falls back to 0.025, then powers back on with original amperage. The readings below are from this state, as it's the most common occurrence. USB light, but no activity. No caps-lock activity. 80% of the time.\n2) Powers on and sticks at 0.025. 20% of time.\n3) This is the odd one -> Powers on and works completely normally, flashing folder mark, etc, but no backlight.
