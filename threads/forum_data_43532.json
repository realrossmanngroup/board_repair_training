            "message": "came with a blown DCIN fuse which is already a joke to see. Also short circuit on mains on the MagSafe board. After Fuse/Charging board replacement i got a fan spin and full choo-choo with a new battery.\nOn my bench. After full assembly, i put it on outcome desk and plugged in an original known-good Magsafe 60w charger which is perfectly compatible with 2012 mid 13' <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. No light, no charge, DCIN cycles on the charger (did not know board can do that, but okay though). Works with a 45w china crap-charger works with my bench cable which is probably also a crap cable.\n\n\nSOLUTION:\nthanks to 2informaticos: <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR> reverse current protection circuit MosFeT: short-circuit between drain and gate. The original power brick is smart enough to cut down the power, bench PSU gives zero shits about reverse current."
