        "message":"So this laptop chimes, has a backlight and the caps key lights up when I tap it, but it never gives an picture. The screen is just black with the backlight on.\n\nI have tried all the usual things like a PRM reset. The external screen doesn't seem to work either, but I am checking with a new HDMI cable tomorrow.\n\nCan someone give some initial direction to get me started please?"
