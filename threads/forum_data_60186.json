        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC": "What is PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC? PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC Is a reference voltage for the SMC’s voltage sensors & other sensors..",

This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",

I decided to replace the SMC and it turned out it had quite a bit of corrosion underneath, however, didn't turn on after the new SMC. I left it for the day after and when i tested again it turned on (booted OS just fine). I cleaned the board in ultrasonic and it stopped working again after that. (missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>)\n\nI took a working board with a faulty CPU and started taking known good parts to replace. All of the following i replaced are known good working parts.\nSMC - Didn't work\n<CHIP>U7100</CHIP> - Didn't work\n<CHIP>U5110</CHIP> - Didn't work\n<CHIP>U1900</CHIP> - Worked\n\nSo, I said to myself, perfect, it was the clock. I cleaned the board and boom doesn't work again.\n[U]All the measurements are taken after this point.[/U]\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12.47V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.31V\n[COLOR=rgb(226, 80, 65)]EDITED: <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> - 1.49V\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> - 0V[/COLOR]\n<SIGNAL>S5_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\n[COLOR=rgb(226, 80, 65)]<SIGNAL>CHGR_A</SIGNAL>/BMON - 0.03V/0.07V[/COLOR]\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> - 3.1V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> - 4.98V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> - 3.31V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.41V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA</SIGNAL> - 3.41V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC</SIGNAL> - 3.27V\n[COLOR=rgb(226, 80, 65)]<SIGNAL>SMC_PBUS_VSENSE</SIGNAL> - 0V[/COLOR]\n\n\nThere was no damage around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> nor around <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>. The damage was heavy in and around the SMC (all fixed) and <CHIP>U8330</CHIP> (fixed as well)\n\nTLDR:\nThe board didn't work after fixing all the visible damage but turned on fine after 12 hours of sitting.\nIt stopped working again after cleaning and started working after replacing the clock chip.\nIt stopped working again after cleaning and I have no clue why. I cleaned 3 other boards today without any issues.\n\nIt might be worth mentioning that both pins 67 and 68 under the SMC were completely gone due to corrosion but both are saying not connected.\nUsing OEM 85W charger for all tests."
