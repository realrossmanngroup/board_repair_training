That line is  AUD_SPKRAMP_INT_L and as you said it is connected directly with U6200. On that path there is R6291 which on one side it has PP1V8_S0 and resistance should be 47K but it is only 1.6K.\n\nChecked rest of resistors around U6200 and here is what is not right:\nR6227 should be 1.5K but it is 69Ohm"}
