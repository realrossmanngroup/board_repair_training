            "message": "I have only worked on maybe 15-20 of these machines and I heard rumors of phantom CPU problems. Not the normal CPU failure were the buck converter driver shorts PP-BUS to the cpu but strange CPU failures.\n\nI am just knocking on the door of people out there to see if it is worth my time to invest in tooling to start changing CPU's on these machines. I have to custom order nozzles for my BGA rework machine and my cost on each nozzle is close to $500 when I have them custom made so I am looking for feed back before I order one.\n\nI started changing CPU's on the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00044</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> today and did have success so I am focusing on these for the time being but am interested to see if there is opportunity on these other boards.   CPU availability and pricing is still real sketchy for the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and similar boards but that will change in the coming months."
