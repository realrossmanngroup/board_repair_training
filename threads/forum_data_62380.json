        "message":"Dear Forum,\n\nOur 27 inch Thunderbolt Display becomes black after 1 minute, and then we cannot get it back to diplay any image anymore. On the MBA, we can still see the 27' in the monitor preferences and its related  position with the MBA.  I have read this topic from 2017 (A1407 Apple Thunderbolt Display 27-Inch Random black outs) but i have a question : the 27h inch is different from the imacs, and has 2 LEDs bars, one on the right, and one on the left. If the common issue with the connector that needs a resoldering is correct for our case, how do you explained that the 2 LEDs failed at the same time ? I'm afraid to enter into this difficult resoldering is this is not the answer to our issue.... Thanks for telling me our to diagnose our issue before puting effort randomly on each possible fix that is known. Kind regards."
