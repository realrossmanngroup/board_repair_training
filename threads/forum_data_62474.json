But this is my first post so excuse me if not good.\n\nGot a liquid damaged <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01949</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> Was already been played with. Found a <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP> on the board in stead of a <CHIP>ISL9240</CHIP>. Replaced it off course with a new ISL 9240. But still no <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. What is needed for <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> to create <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>?\n\nPlease advice where to look. \n\nMeasurements:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 1v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> 3,3V\n\nUSB-C 5V 0,049A.\n\nThanks in advance."
