        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",

        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

Machine Boots up in SMC Bypass Mode but does not see any battery? <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 13.02V With Battery Connected while running in SMC Bypass mode and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.58V while machine is off and charger plugged in with battery connected. An original 87w Charger is being used and battery is Good. I tried the machine with a different 820-00928Board and Machine starts right up without Problems. All 4 <SIGNAL>USB_CHIPS</SIGNAL> are good and getting 20V on the AmpMeter...No Liquid Damage anywhere on Board. Iâ€™m also getting the following measurements...\n<SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL>. 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> 3.1V\n<SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL> 3.29V while Running and 0V before boot up\n<SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> 3.19v\n\nAny Suggestion where to start looking? ANY help would be Greatly Appreciated...Thank You"
