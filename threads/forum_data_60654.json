    "definitions": {
        "SMBUS_CHGR_SDA": "What is SMBUS_CHGR_SDA? SMBUS_CHGR_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "D6950": "What is D6950? a DIODE.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "820-2879": "What is 820-2879? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMBUS_CHGR_SCL": "What is SMBUS_CHGR_SCL? SMBUS_CHGR_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "R5280": "What is R5280? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "D7005": "What is D7005? a DIODE."
