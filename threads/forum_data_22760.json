I can't find anywhere. \nDoes anyone know the diagnostic leds mean on this model. I have the bottom one on, the next one up flashs on button push and the rest don't light up. \nImac does not boot. \nHave gone though board, no liquid damage or burnt out components. \nCost me $100 dead with a supposedly good LCD so might just strip down and sell anyway. \nThanks."}
