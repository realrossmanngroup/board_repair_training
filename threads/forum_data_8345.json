The problem with this macbook pro is that the trackpad is laggy.  The desktop loads very slow.  After a while the screen just moves from the desktop screen to the widget screen.  The computer stays on if on charger, but if unplugged, after a while would just shut down.  I cannot find the board number on the board.  What is that I need to check to fix this computer."}

Every board has the number on a different spot. If you tell me the board number, I can show you where to find it, but this becomes a chicken\/egg fallacy. Identifying boards is something you'll have to do before we can help you.\n\nEither way, just find U5400 as I said and fix what is wrong in that area."}
