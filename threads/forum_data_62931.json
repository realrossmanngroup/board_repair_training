A working <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> board I tested is an open circuit between that line and ground.\n- If it is a short to ground, how would I find which component is causing it?\n- Where is this power line generated, what chip/component, and from what source power line? I can't seem to find it on my schematic or boardview.\n- If it is not a short to ground, what do I test?\n\nThanks!"

The short to ground in this machine was indeed one of the capacitors in the set of <CAPACITOR>C8460</CAPACITOR>-73. I replaced it with a capacitor from a donor board and the machine worked perfectly. Thank you so much!"
