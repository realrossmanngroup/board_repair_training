A working A1707 board I tested is an open circuit between that line and ground.\n- If it is a short to ground, how would I find which component is causing it?\n- Where is this power line generated, what chip\/component, and from what source power line? I can't seem to find it on my schematic or boardview.\n- If it is not a short to ground, what do I test?\n\nThanks!"}

What's a good voltage to start with, to inject after removing L8452?\nAlso, when I desolder the capacitors, what temperature do I need to keep the hot air machine at, and what distance away from the board is best?"}

The short to ground in this machine was indeed one of the capacitors in the set of C8460-73. I replaced it with a capacitor from a donor board and the machine worked perfectly. Thank you so much!"}
