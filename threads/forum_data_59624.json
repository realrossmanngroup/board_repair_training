Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

But today it’s not boot in to any hdd or OS X. :( I’ve swapped it twice with two hdd and two SATA flex cables know good. Checked  the fl4510 and caps <CAPACITOR>C4511</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C4510</CAPACITOR>\nI have 5v at SATA connector pins 9,11. The fl4510 has continuity from terminals 1-2, 3-4. The <CHIP>U4510</CHIP> area is spotless. <SIGNAL>SATARDRVR_A_EN</SIGNAL> =3.4v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ODD_DETECT</SIGNAL> =3.3v\nat <RESISTOR>R4590</RESISTOR> I have a value of 20k ohm and the schematic says 33k.\nLastly it won’t pram reset and it also has a weird issue that it won’t respond to power key from time to time while powering on but will always power off with no issue if that means anything. I also swapped it with another keyboard and power button. Just to be sure."
