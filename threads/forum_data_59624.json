        "message":"Hi I received a board with a missing display connector. I replaced it with a new one. Yesterday it booting fine. But today it\u2019s not boot in to any hdd or OS X. :( I\u2019ve swapped it twice with two hdd and two SATA flex cables know good. Checked  the fl4510 and caps c4511,c4510\nI have 5v at SATA connector pins 9,11. The fl4510 has continuity from terminals 1-2, 3-4. The u4510 area is spotless. SATArdrvr_a_en =3.4v\nSmc_odd_detect =3.3v\nat r4590 I have a value of 20k ohm and the schematic says 33k.\nLastly it won\u2019t pram reset and it also has a weird issue that it won\u2019t respond to power key from time to time while powering on but will always power off with no issue if that means anything. I also swapped it with another keyboard and power button. Just to be sure."
