        "message":"Hi all, having an issue with a keyboard on an A2179. Had 2 come in for topcase replacement, one also needed a trackpad due to liquid damage and the other we re-used the existing trackpad. On the one with the re-used trackpad, everything went fine. On the one with the new trackpad, the keyboard works except the top row (volume, brightness, etc). These all get treated as normal function keys. The working one has been picked up so I no longer have another trackpad on hand to test with, but I checked in settings and nothing is set to use the top row as function keys instead of their intended purpose. I've read online this may be a compatibility issue with the trackpad being programmed for a different country\/topcase than this one, thus causing the issue - just wanted to see if anyone else has run into this and get some confirmation on what's going on."
