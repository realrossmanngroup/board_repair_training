            "message": "Hello, i got an acer that apparenty just needed a new power jack, but the thing won't POST, test card gives error 0, when you boot it up fan spins fast for a second and then stops. only power led is on, tried flashing the bios and new cmos battery but no change to the behaviour, cpu, gpu gets \"gently\" warm, intel chipset gets way warmer than the other chips. i have a donor board that i took out from an identical laptop time ago which has the same issues but without any chip getting warm. even there i tried with a bios flashing but with no results. what should i check to get either of them them working? there aren't any other component getting warm signaling a short, the charger doesn't trip and both charge the battery just fine. thank you"
