I replaced diode on DC Inboard and logic board turned on and booted. Keyboard was also damaged. Would not get green light on charger and no fan with old keyboard installed. Replaced keyboard and everything was working for a while. Started to reinstall OSX and during at some point the board just started to cycle 1 fan spin continuously. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> is missing. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> was there but was flaky. Now n missing as well and no spin at all. G3Hot 12.5V, PP3V42 3.42V, PPVINRTC 3.4V, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> 12.5V, PPDCIN 16.7V. Missing both enables on <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>.
