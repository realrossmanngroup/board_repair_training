            "message": "You can. Helps if you give the board number. I am guessing you mean the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> connector. The standard old style connector was used from 2008-2011. The new style was only used for the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> from 2012, which was not a popular machine: most elected to purchase a retina rather than a classic that year. Since that connector was only used for a single year, on an unpopular model, it isn't worth stocking whichis what makes it so expensive from the very few vendors that supply it. Low demand. I've replaced less than 3 of them."
