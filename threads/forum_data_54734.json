Sometimes it will think it's closed and turn off the screen and sometimes it will turn on automatically when it's off. I realize the \"any key to turn it on\" feature can make things weird, but this is going beyond that. Any idea what might be happening? This has happened with multiple computers, logic boards and top cases. SMC reset will get it to turn on normally."

Once that happens, the screen will not come back on and the only way to restart the computer is to do an SMC reset. It will then be back to normal after that. Other than that, it works perfectly if I don't close the screen. All sleep/wake and shutdown/restart functions are normal. Not sure where to go next."

The touchpad is powered up, keyboard backlight on, but only way to get the display to come back is to turn it off and back on. \n\nThis has a replacement logic board, the original had a shorted CPU after liquid damage. The Audio board and cable (at the connector) are both liquid damaged. I had hoped it wasn't bad enough to cause problems, but I assume this is it."
