        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",

        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

Even for more experienced people like Duke & I these usually wind up in the trash heap.\n\nThat being said, troubleshooting should begin by checking all the rails and seeing what is missing. See if any of them have short circuits on them, come back with what is missing. Does <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> pulse when you plug the charger in? It will be very quick so you'll want to have someone else plug it in while you have your hands on the meter probes to catch it."
