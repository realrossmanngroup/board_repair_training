Runs perfectly fine on battery but the moment i connect the adapter cable it shuts down completely. I changed the DC board but still same behavior. I have a green light that turns yellow but no voltage on F7140 when connected to Adapter. 7.6v on F7140 on battery and boots up all the way. What direction do i move to begin with?"}
