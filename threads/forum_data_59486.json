        "820-00244": "What is 820-00244? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U3100": "What is U3100? a CHIP.",
        "PPVIN_G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO": "What is PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO? PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing chip. When this is missing, either a capacitor on the line has shorted, PP3V3_G3H is missing, or the CD3215 is bad..",
        "PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC": "What is PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC? PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing chip. When this is missing, either a capacitor on the line has shorted, PP3V3_G3H is missing, or the CD3215 is bad..",

        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "P_IN": "What is P_IN? a SIGNAL.",
        "VR_AON": "What is VR_AON? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. ."
