It seems like the SMC is turning the ISL6259 off for some reason. \nIve already replaced the ISL6259, The SMC, check all current sensing around the ISL6259.ect and have had no symtom changes atall.\n\nAny help would be appreciated."}

Dont usualy miss things like that. \n\nTypically this board is still a pain in the ass. Its now posting but with a messed up screen, It boots though, im fairly sure the GMUX has failed. Just my luck."}
