When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging.."

            "message": "HI\nIm working on a 2915 that had heavy liquid damaged, ive done a lot of rework, Ive got it to the point where it chimes and remains on in SMC bypass.\n\nNow when its not in SMC bypass the system does spin the fans, but only when 12V is high, it often drops to about 3V then goes back to  12V. It seems like the SMC is turning the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> off for some reason. \nIve already replaced the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>, The SMC, check all current sensing around the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>.ect and have had no symtom changes atall.\n\nAny help would be appreciated."
