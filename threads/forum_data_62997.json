The screen shows the battery and then goes off again when the charger drops back to 0.2a\n\nDoes this on all 4 ports.\n\nI've checked <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>, <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>, UB300, UB400 and the main issue I can see is the following:\n\nUB400 <SIGNAL>USBC_TB_CC1</SIGNAL> I only get 0.080v \nUB300 <SIGNAL>USBC_TA_CC2</SIGNAL> I only get 0.132v\n<CHIP>U3100</CHIP> <SIGNAL>USBC_XA_CC2</SIGNAL> I only get 0.004v\n\nAll others test as about 0.520v in diode mode.\n\nSo do you think there's a chance UB400, UB300 and <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> need replacing or am I not looking far enough into this?"
