The screen shows the battery and then goes off again when the charger drops back to 0.2a\n\nDoes this on all 4 ports.\n\nI've checked U3100, U3200, UB300, UB400 and the main issue I can see is the following:\n\nUB400 USBC_TB_CC1 I only get 0.080v \nUB300 USBC_TA_CC2 I only get 0.132v\nU3100 USBC_XA_CC2 I only get 0.004v\n\nAll others test as about 0.520v in diode mode.\n\nSo do you think there's a chance UB400, UB300 and U3100 need replacing or am I not looking far enough into this?"}

Hadn't noticed the one I was testing with was a 61w version.\n\nOn one of the ports its fine with the USBC plug turned upside down but not the other orientation.\nOn another port, I get 5v only with the plug one way round and 0v the other way.\n\nI've tried 3 IO boards and all three do the same thing.\n\nAt least its powering on with two ports though"}
