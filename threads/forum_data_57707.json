The Touch Bar display works and is normal but it does not respond to touch.   I verified that the power rails to the touch bar are good.  I have no clue as to the data and do not have a touchbar laying around to test with.\n\nHas anyone seen this?  Does anyone have additional insight to which data lines are for what and what they should look like?\n\nThanks\nRandall"
