When I first received the machine with the battery inserted I plugged in my 85w charger the board started sparking right next to the battery connector. I quickly removed the charger and battery and starting cleaning the liquid damage.\nThe only power rail that was missing was PPVCC_S0_CPU.\nI restored vcore and now it is about 1.78v.\n\nI plugged in the display but nothing shows on the screen. On Pin 1 of U8300 I got 0v which means no display is being detected.\n\nThis is a 15\" 2014 retina and the only other retina screen I have is a 13\" 2014 retina display which I'm not sure if that is working either since it just came in with another liquid damaged machine.\nI plugged in the 13\"retina display and I got 0v on Pin1 of U8300 and PPVCC_S0_CPU so I'm guessing they aren't compatible.\n\nWhen I plug in my USB stick it lights up.\n\nIs there anything on the board I should check to make sure this is not a problem with the board?"}
