This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

            "message": "Hi Guys, I have a Mac Air 11\" 3208 with no green/red light. Checked power and no G3H and 3.42 as well. On <TRANSISTOR>Q6910</TRANSISTOR> I get 20.55v on <CAPACITOR>C6912</CAPACITOR> pin 1. I have checked the resistors as well and get some different readings then what my schematics say. Now I have seen many istances where the schematics have wrong data, could you have a look at the readings I got and let me know if this is OK, <RESISTOR>R6911</RESISTOR> and 6912 seem a bit off. Thanks!\n\nEdit: I just figured <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> has a hole in it, so will try replacing that first :)"

The line is intact thats kinda weird? I would assume it must have 20.55v as well. So no power reaches <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> VIN (pin 6), any suggestions?"
