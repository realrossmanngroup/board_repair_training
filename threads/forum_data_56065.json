        "820-2850": "What is 820-2850? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U5725": "What is U5725? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "BUTTON_DISABLE": "What is BUTTON_DISABLE? BUTTON_DISABLE disables the trackpad when SMC_LID is below 0.5v and the system believes the lid is closed. .",

        "PCH_INTRUDER_L": "What is PCH_INTRUDER_L? PCH_INTRUDER_L is a signal that tells the machine the case has been opened by an intruder when it is low, the _L means it is present when it is low. This signal should always be high in a Macbook since it doesnâ€™t use intrusion detection. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",
        "PCH_INTVRMEN": "What is PCH_INTVRMEN? PCH_INTVRMEN is an Internal Voltage Regulator Enable: When pulled high, this signal enables\nthe internal 1.05 V regulators for the Suspend well in the PCH. This signal must\nremain asserted for the VRMs to behave properly (no glitches allowed).\nThis signal must be pulled-up to VCCRTC on desktop platforms and may\noptionally be pulled low on mobile platforms if using an external VR for the\nVCCSUS rail.",
        "R5015": "What is R5015? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_ONOFF": "What is SMC_ONOFF? SMC_ONOFF is a signal that tells the machine that the power button has been pressed so it knows to turn on, or turn off. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence.."

Power Button works time to time. . power on when connect the charger and can shutdown pressing power button but can't turn on again.\n When this happen can't turn on even shorting power pads. Replaced <CAPACITOR>C5725</CAPACITOR> same be behaviour. disconnecting keyboard, pressing power pads it stops and restart.\n\nChecked with known woring keyboard same issue. \n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> 3.3v and pressing power button does to 0.4 for few seconds and back to 3.3v <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> 3.V, <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> 3.3v  and <SIGNAL>BUTTON_DISABLE</SIGNAL> 0V. <RESISTOR>R5710</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C5710</CAPACITOR> get 3.3v \n\nI HAVE REPLACED <CAPACITOR>C5725</CAPACITOR>, <CHIP>U5725</CHIP>, SMC But no luck.\n\n\nAny idea?"
