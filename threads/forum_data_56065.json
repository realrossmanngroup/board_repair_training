Power Button works time to time. . power on when connect the charger and can shutdown pressing power button but can't turn on again.\n When this happen can't turn on even shorting power pads. Replaced C5725 same be behaviour. disconnecting keyboard, pressing power pads it stops and restart.\n\nChecked with known woring keyboard same issue. \n\nSMC_ONOFF_L 3.3v and pressing power button does to 0.4 for few seconds and back to 3.3v SMC_RESET_L 3.V, SMC_LID 3.3v  and BUTTON_DISABLE 0V. R5710 and C5710 get 3.3v \n\nI HAVE REPLACED C5725, U5725, SMC But no luck.\n\n\nAny idea?"
