        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_AGATE": "What is CHGR_AGATE? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

            "message": "I think I had a bad charger that killed several boards the same way. I first found a short in <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> on <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL>, which was cleared after changing the ISL. The short is gone, but I am still not getting any ppbus. I have a resistance of about 20ohms between pin 27 and 28. I have about 4ohms between pin 17 and 18. I think I have found an abnormality, I am not getting any current passed through <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>. I think the reason is the <SIGNAL>CHGR_AGATE</SIGNAL> is passing over 16v. On a working board <SIGNAL>CHGR_AGATE</SIGNAL> is 0v. Since <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> is a p channel mosfet, I think it needs low voltage on the gate to turn on. It seems like <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> is putting out high voltage on <SIGNAL>CHGR_AGATE</SIGNAL> when in needs to be low. Any suggestions?"

Before replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> don't we first need to get the enable fixed? On a working board both <SIGNAL>CHGR_AGATE_DIV</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>CHGR_SGATE_DIV</SIGNAL> are about 6.5 volts. On this unworking board, they are 15.8v and 12v. The specs for the mosfet are about 2v for the gate threshold. Until we figure out the gate issue, should we even worry about the mosfet? Then my logic is since we changed <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> already it may one of its inputs causing the issue. I will change <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> just in case"
