If I should blame cpu/pch or BIOS/T2 chip. I do not know if the DFU was completed or not. I haven't found anywere an explanation of the symbol I get after the DFU... I can't say it didn't succeded because I have no experience on this new Apple tool that's why I'm asking the forum for help. I can't belive the only known problem with these machine could be just with the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>... It seems like when the infamous T2 chip gets involved engineers rise their hends up and stop thinking to other possible solutions ;-)"
