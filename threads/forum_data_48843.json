            "message": "Hello, we got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3662</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with liquid damage that came in dead. Some line at the CPU power IC was burned we replaced and now it works again but with a slow mouse and high fanspin. Apple ASD gives 2 errors.\n\n- Sensor Current IM0C DDR test 1\n- Ts0P Palmrest\n\nSo far we have replaced a new trackpad with cable and tried without cam/wifi installed. We also replaced <CHIP>U5560</CHIP> although it looked good, no shorts there and all resistor measure OK.\n\nAny other options? Customer is leaving tomorrow and I would be so sad if I made the mac work but cannot charge him :P"
