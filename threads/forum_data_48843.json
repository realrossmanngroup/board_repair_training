Some line at the CPU power IC was burned we replaced and now it works again but with a slow mouse and high fanspin. Apple ASD gives 2 errors.\n\n- Sensor Current IM0C DDR test 1\n- Ts0P Palmrest\n\nSo far we have replaced a new trackpad with cable and tried without cam\/wifi installed. We also replaced U5560 although it looked good, no shorts there and all resistor measure OK.\n\nAny other options? Customer is leaving tomorrow and I would be so sad if I made the mac work but cannot charge him :P"}

Resistors have correct values and traces seem to be OK. I have only 0.6v on pin 5 of U5560, should be 3.3v correct? Thats also what i measure on SMC_1V35MRM_ISENSE. I do have 3.3v at J4800 so it is being created. No short on pin 5 of U5560 as well, i measure 0.468."}
