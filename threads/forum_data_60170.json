            "message": "I'm working through my first real \"logic board repair\" and it happens to be on this old, mid-2010 MacBook (2.4GHz) model.  I've looked through the YouTube channel and searched the forums, but I'm stuck on what and where to test - and in which order.  I've removed the system board and have attached my known good AC adapter to it.  I'm showing 16V on the first two pins, and nothing on the last three.  Not sure where to go from here :(  Any and all assistance would be helpful.  I'm not sure how to access the \"guides\" to figure out what pins and whatnot go where - so hoping you can help!  Thanks in advance!"
