            "message": "I'm trying to revive an old <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board with liquid damage. I replaced several corroded components around <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>, <CHIP>U5000</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>, and <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>, including the SMC, backlight driver, and EFI chip. Now this machine is running nicely and passes Apple Hardware Test. But whenever I try to update the OS, the machine restarts to begin updating, then stalls - the fan spins up and stops, spins up and stops, and so on. Only unplugging the battery makes the board start up again (and the update is not applied).\n\nAny idea why the machine works fine except during OS updates?"
