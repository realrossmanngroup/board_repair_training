        "message":"Hi guys,\nHave 820-00165 here, liquid damage while ago, machine was working fine, suddenly stopped working 2 days ago, U1900 corrosion on 2 pins, replaced, U6100 Pin 5 small corrosion, but all voltages(3.3) present at U6100, jtag removed was corroded, U7501 looks good, SMC good, small crap around PP3v42 area but all voltages present compared with working board, U1950 area clean,\nPPbus 8.57V, PP3V42 3.4V, SMC_Reset_L 3.3V, PP5V_s5 5V, PP5V_S4RS3 1.18V - no short 52Kohm's, P3V3_S5_REG_L 56 ohm tp ground however while charger connected 3.3V present, other areas of the board looks good,\nAny hints to go further?"
