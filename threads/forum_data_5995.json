This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

I replaced the magsafe and have only gotten orange light for about 30 seconds before it fades out.  I took out the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3536</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a logic board and noticed a few burned out filters.  I tried re-flowing them but looks like they need to be replaced.  I couldn't find a schematic for the logic board with a google search so was hoping you could point me to the right direction to get a replacement.  Do these two filters have anything to do with charging?"
