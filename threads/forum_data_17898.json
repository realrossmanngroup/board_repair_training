Cleaned and now we have a fan spin but no video. After a few seconds the fan speed starts to get a little faster. No beeps with RAM installed but also no beeps with RAM not installed. SMC and PRAM reset performed. Nothing replaced yet because I'm not sure where to start with these symptoms. Just looking for some guidance. Thanks!"}
