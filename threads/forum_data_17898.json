If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

No beeps with RAM installed but also no beeps with RAM not installed. SMC and PRAM reset performed. Nothing replaced yet because I'm not sure where to start with these symptoms. Just looking for some guidance. Thanks!"
