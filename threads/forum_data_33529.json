Tried with another keyboard and mouse, different working ones, same result. Goes to login screen and nothing works. Hardware test said there may be an issue with KBD\/Mouse and Thunderbold. Mac had some liquid spill long ago and some IC dont look to good. I did check the Power to trackpad and keyboard, they have 3.3 as well as 3.42v. Also checked U4801 and resistors around it, seems all OK. Could it be that a short in the Thunderbold circuit freezes the keyboard and mouse as well? They both use 3.3v S4, but I did not see the lines connect with KBD\/TRPAD in boardview."}

It only comes high if a device is connected or how to troubleshoot this circuit? There is a short to ground on 1.05V TBT \"CIO\" Switch and missing 1.05v. Anyway this can relate to KBD\/TRCPAD?"}
