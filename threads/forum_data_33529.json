            "message": "Hi Guys I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3226</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with no keyboard mouse. Tried with another keyboard and mouse, different working ones, same result. Goes to login screen and nothing works. Hardware test said there may be an issue with KBD/Mouse and Thunderbold. Mac had some liquid spill long ago and some IC dont look to good. I did check the Power to trackpad and keyboard, they have 3.3 as well as 3.42v. Also checked <CHIP>U4801</CHIP> and resistors around it, seems all OK. Could it be that a short in the Thunderbold circuit freezes the keyboard and mouse as well? They both use 3.3v S4, but I did not see the lines connect with KBD/TRPAD in boardview."

It only comes high if a device is connected or how to troubleshoot this circuit? There is a short to ground on 1.05V TBT \"CIO\" Switch and missing 1.05v. Anyway this can relate to KBD/TRCPAD?"
