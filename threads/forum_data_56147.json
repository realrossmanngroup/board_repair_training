        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP5V_MAIN_VCCSA": "What is PP5V_MAIN_VCCSA? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP5V_G3S": "What is PP5V_G3S? PP5V_G3S is a 5v power rail present when the system is in a G3S standby state.",

It gets 20V, has <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>, has 5V on <SIGNAL>PP5V_MAIN_VCCSA</SIGNAL> but no CPU power. There is a very slight amount of heat on the CPU. I'm not finding any shorts though. Any idea where to go next?"
