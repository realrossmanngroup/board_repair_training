There where corrosion on both sides of the board around <CHIP>U3890</CHIP>.\n<RESISTOR>R3888</RESISTOR> was blown and I have replaced it. I have also replaced all the large caps above <CHIP>U3890</CHIP> since they looked really bad.\nThe board shows the same symptoms before and after.\n\nAny idea that can help me a bit further with this one?"
