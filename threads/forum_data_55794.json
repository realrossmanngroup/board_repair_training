            "message": "Hi guys!\n\nStill new to this but please bare with me. As per the forum rules I am thick skinned and here to learn and i'll be on the forum a lot I expect so please feel free to tell me if i've been a dick and done something stupid (preferably followed by some helpful guidance on how to fix said stupid act...). I will respond in kind by the way so be prepared!\n\nAlrighty, so today we have... A MacBook!\n\n15? MacBook Pro Retina 2012 exhibiting intermittent no video issues.\n\nNot my first rodeo so thought i'll just do quick <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> touch up with the assistance of some nice Amtec flux (oh thanks Louis by the way, I DIDN'T WAIT and I BOUGHT NOW! the crap I was using previously from Jaycar in Australia was terrible! Vaseline would have been more effective...) and be on on my way....\n\nAnyway, following my very gentle touch up and reflow of the surrounding area, a quick dip in the ultrasonic spa and an hour in the tanning bed, my board returned with a suprise gift....\n\nNo Fan Spin! ?\n\nThe only \"mistake\" I made (that i'm aware of) was an accidental bumped resistor, <RESISTOR>R8940</RESISTOR> (which launched itself across the room somewhere where it will remain for eternity...). I didnt have a 147K in my component book (thanks Louis again, the component folders are awesome... usually) so I used a 150K. Eventually swapped it back for a 147K from a donor board with no improvement in my situation. That had sounded stupid to me (the apparent minor difference in resistance couldnt possible be my issue?!) but it is a 1% tolerance resistor which would be 147+-1,470ohms... So my 150K would be well outside, particularly if it was at the higher end of its tolerence by pure luck (guaranteed right, murphys law)... but it seemed so small! 147 vs 150, cmon?! I may have forgotton the K.... Anyways... this Resistor is the RBIAS line of the <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>... What is RBIAS? I'm guessing maybe I need it... Sigh.\n\nSoooo in summary here's where i'm at...\n\n\nIntermittent no video output issues. Suspected <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> dry joints\n[LIST]\n[*]Fluxed & Resoldered <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and surrounding components.\n[*]Accidentally bumped off <RESISTOR>R8940</RESISTOR> (147K). Replaced with 150K from component book. Ultrasonic cleaned. No fan spin :(\n[*]Replaced <RESISTOR>R8940</RESISTOR> with 147K from donor board (why not). No fan spin?\n[*]Missing S4 power rails (stuck in S5 state).\n[*]Missing Enable1 (<SIGNAL>P5VS4_EN</SIGNAL>) on <CHIP>U7201</CHIP>. Traced it backwards to <CHIP>U7970</CHIP> logic gate (74LVC1G32). No <SIGNAL>P5V3V3_S4_EN</SIGNAL> on pin 4 of gate.\n[*]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> on pin 6 of <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> is happy so I have VCC (according to spec sheet)\n[*]I have no <SIGNAL>PM_SLEEP_S5_L</SIGNAL> on pin 2 OR <SIGNAL>SMC_WAKESRC_EN</SIGNAL> on pin 1... So as per highschool math 0 OR 0 = 0 :(\n[LIST]\n[*]<SIGNAL>PM_SLEEP_S5_L</SIGNAL> comes from what i'm guessing used to be the Psomething (PMIC?) or M something that louis always talks about that now appears to be part of the <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> which I hope to god doesn't need reballing/replacing\n[*]<SIGNAL>SMC_WAKESRC_EN</SIGNAL> appears to come from <CHIP>U4900</CHIP> which looks suspiciously like an SMC chip which I also don't fancy replacing...\n[/LIST]\n[*]So basically I'm hoping that i went off track somewhere up there around <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> and that my fault lies BEFORE that and that i'm totally on the wrong track... Because otherwise it would appear I may have to reball some nasty looking shit?\n[/LIST] Oh wow, long post, sorry, got over excited.\n\n:)"

You?re right though, I have a good quality Australian made ultrasonic cleaner but it does not have a sweep function.\n\nOkay will get back to you with coil resistances tonight (just running out the door to work). I just checked a couple though and found some appear to be unstable, like counting down from 25Mohms quite slowly (took 5 mins to count down to 6Mohms and was still goin)... do I just wait this out till it settles? or will it just keep counting down to 0? Is this significant?"
