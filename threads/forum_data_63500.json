Client says that it just stoped working.\n\nWith the board alone at the bench, the ampmeter just stays black, and on the bench PSU it pulls 5.06V.\n\nUSBC_XA_CC1\/2 and USBC_XB_CC1\/2 diode reading seams to be ok (0.594).\n\nPP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS_F has 0.522V on F3000, and 0.184  diode reading\n\nPP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS_F has 5.06V on F3010, and 0.184  diode reading\n\n Should i  replace U3100?"}

The ampmeter stayed black again, but it worked while on battery.\n\nHowever, after a PR Reset it started to pull 20V again,  2.98A and is charging the battery again.\n\nWaht should i check to make sure that it is ok?"}
