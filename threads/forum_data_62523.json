The only area which had slight corrosion was U8210 and R1355. After cleaning and refreshing this area board starts, takes 20V, trackpad clicks but board is stuck at 0,26A. There is no chime, no image, no post. \n\nThe voltages I have measured:\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 13,05V\nPP3V3_S5 - 3,3V\nPP5V_S4 - 5,1V\nPP1V2_S3 - 1,196V\nPP1V_S5G_REG - 0,992V\nPPVCCPCH_S5G - 0,995V\nPP1V8_S5G - 1,8V\nPPVCCCPU_S0G - 0V (CPU ressistance is around 6ohms)\nPLT_RST_L - 0V\n\n\nI have replaced U8210 with the chip from donor board. Inspected every inch of the board and haven't found anu other corrosion except mentioned. Also have tried known good BIOS from this forum (clean ME) and no difference. Any ideas?"}
