            "message": "Hey, I'm working on this board, which measures 0.4 ohms from <SIGNAL>PP12V_G3H</SIGNAL> to ground, measured on pin 4/5/6 of J600 . When i put 12v on <SIGNAL>PP12V_G3H</SIGNAL> i get a little heat on <TRANSISTOR>Q7870</TRANSISTOR>. I removed it, measured again, now the 0.4 ohms is on <SIGNAL>PPBUS12V_S5</SIGNAL>. I put the 12v again on <SIGNAL>PPBUS12V_S5</SIGNAL>, but no luck with warm components.\nTo make sure none of the lower s5 rails are shorted i disconnected L7710, L7610, L7650. after that i still measure the 0.4 ohms on <SIGNAL>PP12V_S5</SIGNAL>. I've done the same with the mosfets for these circuits, still no change.\nAre there any sensible options to continue this? Currently the only thing i can think of is to one by one remove all capacitors related to the <SIGNAL>PP12V_S5</SIGNAL> rail and see when the short disappears. I feel like i'm missing something very obvious."

If so i will take them off to check.\n\nWe use a power supply that limits the current, so i set it to 3A at 12v, but the output voltage will drop to .4v or something, so no risk of fires."
