Same with <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> it ranges from 1.7 to 3.4.  And DCIN fluctruates a little 16.5-16.8. I've changed SMC and <CHIP>U7941</CHIP>. With <CHIP>U7941</CHIP> removed, <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2EN</SIGNAL> and DCIN are steady. I also changed <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR>/5 prior thinking that was related to DCIN values not steady. It's almost like something is causing the board to completely shut down and restart? Like even the sysonewire is resetting or something.  I also tried running from power supply instead of Magasafe and that keeps DCIN steady but still unsteady <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL>.  SMC Bypass doesn't change anything."
