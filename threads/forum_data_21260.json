I had green light on the charger, but it wouldn't power on. I opened it up and found some very noticeable water corrosion on U7201, particularly around pins 25 - 30. I cleaned the area and replaced U7201, but I lost pads 26 and 27, so replaced these with wire. After this, the computer booted up fine and worked without flaw. After about a week, I opened it up to replace the hard drive, but then it wouldn't boot anymore. Exactly the same symptoms as before. I thought I might have damaged something, but I think the failure was just coincidental. \n\nI have PP18V5_DCIN_CONN, PPBUS_G3H, PP3V42_G3H_REG and PPVIN_S5_CPU_IMVP_ISNS, but I don't have PP5V_S3_REG, I don't have P5VS3_EN and I don't have PM_SLP_S4_L.\n\nI have watched Louis' video on this model (replacing C7771), but in his example he didn't have PP1V05_S5_MCP, but I am reading 1.1V for PP1V05_S5_MCP.\nWhen power is connected, the MCP gets pretty warm too.\n\nDoes this sound like a dead MCP?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can provide.\nBruce"}
