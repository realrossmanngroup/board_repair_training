        "A1297": "What is A1297? A1297 is a model number for a 17 inch size MacBook Pro Unibody from years Early 2009, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011 with EMC 2272, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2390, 820-2610, 820-2849, 820-2914..",
        "U7201": "What is U7201? U7201 is responsible for the 3.3v and 5v power rails on many devices..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

I had green light on the charger, but it wouldn't power on. I opened it up and found some very noticeable water corrosion on <CHIP>U7201</CHIP>, particularly around pins 25 - 30. I cleaned the area and replaced <CHIP>U7201</CHIP>, but I lost pads 26 and 27, so replaced these with wire. After this, the computer booted up fine and worked without flaw. After about a week, I opened it up to replace the hard drive, but then it wouldn't boot anymore. Exactly the same symptoms as before. I thought I might have damaged something, but I think the failure was just coincidental. \n\nI have <SIGNAL>PP18V5_DCIN_CONN</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H_REG</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_CPU_IMVP_ISNS</SIGNAL>, but I don't have <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL>, I don't have <SIGNAL>P5VS3_EN</SIGNAL> and I don't have <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>.\n\nI have watched Louis' video on this model (replacing <CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR>), but in his example he didn't have <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S5_MCP</SIGNAL>, but I am reading 1.1V for <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S5_MCP</SIGNAL>.\nWhen power is connected, the MCP gets pretty warm too.\n\nDoes this sound like a dead MCP?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can provide.\nBruce"
