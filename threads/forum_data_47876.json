Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

Even when I restart it, it will stay stuck in sleep mode.\nUnless i disconnect magsafe + charger it will boot again.\nThis happens with and without battery.\nLost how to tackle this one. It came for ripped trackpad cable replacement. Now it?s back for this issue...\nThanks"
