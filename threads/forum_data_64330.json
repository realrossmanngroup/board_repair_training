Found one of the GPU mosfets to be short, killing the AMD GPU.\n\nPrevious owner reported screen was working fine when the macbook turned off, now on another machine I have backlight but no image, the screen is reported in macOS with correct resolution. I want to revive at least the screen, since they're ridiculously expensive.\n\nI think some PPBUS drove into the tcon board and killed one or more of the display port decoders. I have plenty of broken screens here, but I'm unsure which parts to change. For some I can't find a datasheet.\n- 49B1-04 (or -03) seems to be a backlight driver, not my issue\n- <CHIP>TPS65156</CHIP>: no data sheet (Intersil 2488D on another board)\n- <CHIP>TPS65157</CHIP>: no data sheet (98669A on antoher board)\n- LPC812: microcontroller\n\nShould I try and go for the TI chips first?"
