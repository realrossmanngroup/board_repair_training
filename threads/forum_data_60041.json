It is usually drawing 40mA and not powering on, so I checked power rails and am missing <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>. I removed L7220 and injected 5v to mimmic the 5v rail coming from <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> and then triggered <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> and the board started. I removed the wires and put L7220 back on, try it again and the board fired up. Well after the board cooled off, it would no longer start, so I back to square one. I took my heat gun and heated the areas again and lo and behold it started again. I'm beginning to suspect a bad cap."
