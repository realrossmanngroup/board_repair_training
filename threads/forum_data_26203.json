If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",

All I have is 13\" 2013 displays to try, would that work? I know the techs at the shop this came from, they have the skill to properly troubleshoot so I don't doubt their KG equipment or methods. Once they believe it's board related they ship it to me, they don't tinker with it themselves. The connector and cable look good as new. The connector pins are all firmly connected to the board, the inside looks clean and ok as well."
