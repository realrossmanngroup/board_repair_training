After the battery replacement (tried two different ones), the macbook doesn't recognize the battery anymore.  It runs fine off of the charger, but when the charger is disconnected, the computer goes off.  Yes, the special screw that shorts out the two pads is in place and working properly (tested with a multimeter).  And the interposer plate is in place.  The plastic battery bracket is missing though...is that needed?  Any ideas?"

This data line also goes to the battery as can be seen on page 42 of the PDF schematic.

The bracket missing likely caused it to slide and let 12v go to the 3v SMC data line. This won't short it to ground, it'll fry the SMC though. SMC and <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> should be replaced.\n\nAfter all of this you will find that the replacement batteries are likely total junk since this machine was only around for 3-4 months before Apple changed the design entirely, so there isn't much demand for anyone to find/create batteries to them.\n\nYour homework is to find a good SMC from a donor <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3462</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board and put it on and check your <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> voltage after replacing the SMC. Do not plug the battery in yet as we want to know before anything else occurs whether this is a good SMC or not and if we have resolved our problem."
