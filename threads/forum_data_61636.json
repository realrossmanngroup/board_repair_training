When booting, the screen has no backlight until the loading bar has reached about 80%.\nI noticed that when I turned it on the charging cable (85W original) shows orange for a short moment, then green -> orange as normal. No idea if it have something to do with the backlight problem.\nAt <CAPACITOR>C8303</CAPACITOR>: 1 <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> I measure 49V at start (without backlight), as soon as the backlight switches on 40V."
