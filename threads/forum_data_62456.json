If I switch the side of the power cable, the ampmeter just blinks.\n\nOn F4700, when the ampmeter blinks, I only get 2.5-7 V\nF4700 diode value is ok (0.554)\n\n<SIGNAL>E85_CC1</SIGNAL>/2 diode values seams to be ok (0.547).\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_LDO_VDDA</SIGNAL>/P diode values also seams ok (0.445)\n\nShould I replace <CHIP>U4700</CHIP>?"
