            "message": "Hi,\n\n\n\nI?ve got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01041</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A that is driving me crazy, so I?m here for a 2[SUP]nd[/SUP] opinion. I know these boards are fairly new, so there is not that much info out there.\n\n\n\nThe problem is I can?t get this board to get 20V from the charger. <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_TA_VBUS</SIGNAL> remains at 5V.\n\n\n\nSo, I get the following voltages\n\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_TA_VBUS</SIGNAL> = 5.15V @ 0.06A\n\n= <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_T</SIGNAL> = 3.374V\n\n= <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X</SIGNAL> = 3.383V\n\n= <SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> = 0.0V\n\n= <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.29V\n\nThere are no G3S voltages\n\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PMU_CLK32K_PCH</SIGNAL> = 32.768Khz\n\n\n\nI have swapped out all 4 CD32. In case any where faulty.\nStill no PP20V!\n\n\n\nThese are the CD32 Voltages\n\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> = 1.802V\n\nPP1V1_UPC_ = 1.11V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC</SIGNAL> = 3.335V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4_X_USBC</SIGNAL> = 0.0V\n\n\n\nThere is data on <SIGNAL>USBC_XA_CC1_CONN</SIGNAL>. So the charger is talking to CD32.\nSMC Reset Circuit\n\n\n\n<CHIP>U6940</CHIP> voltages\n\n<SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> = 3.38V\n\n<SIGNAL>PMU_RSLOC_RST_L</SIGNAL> = 3.38V\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_RST_IN_R</SIGNAL> = 0.0V\n\n\n\nCommunication with the SMC\n\n\n\n<SIGNAL>I2C_UPC_SCL</SIGNAL> = 1.8V\n\n<SIGNAL>I2C_UPC_SDA</SIGNAL> = 1.8V\n\n<SIGNAL>UPC_I2C_INT_L</SIGNAL> = 0V\n\n\n\nThere is no activity on these data lines. No pulses at all on my scope.\n\n\n\nT2 Voltages\n\n\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVDDCPU_AWAKE</SIGNAL> =0.825V\n\nPPVDDCPUSRAM_AWAKE =0.802V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP0V82_SLPDDR</SIGNAL> = 0.821V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_SLPDDR</SIGNAL> 1.1V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP0V9_SLPDDR</SIGNAL> 0.9V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_AWAKE</SIGNAL> = 1.2V\n\n\n\nThe board is crystal clear. No liquid damage I can see, under the microscope.\n\nOf course, the customer needs some critical data. Since its looking like a SMC and SMC is integrated into <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> T2 chip its looking hopeless.\n\n\n\nAnyone have any ideas on what else I could try or what I could have missed ?"

            "message": "If the \"SOC ROM\" gets corrupted there will also not be 20V. This is <CHIP>U4770</CHIP> on 01521 schematic so probably the same on this one. \nProblem here is if you flash a good binary in there the 20V will be back but the machine will not power on as the ROM is married to the T2 chip.\nSo far I do not have enough dumps/machines yet to be able to figure this stuff out. It may be possible to repair the original dump, but I have found that apple has used many different versions of iBoot inside the ROMs. I would need to at least find a known good dump with the same iBoot versions and see if the ROMs can be merged by extracting the unique parts.\n\nSo if you want to mess with this you should read the SOC ROM and find a dump from a good board and flash that in and see if 20V comes back. Then comes the at the moment impossible task of fixing the corrupted ROM.\n\n!!1.8V ROM MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT READ THIS ON 3V3!!"
