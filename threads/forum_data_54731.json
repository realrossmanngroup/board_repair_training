From one of my favorite stupid movies.\nI just saw this fault a second time on a donor board I pulled the part from!  My pulled part was also bad!\n\nIt can be tricky as it does not show up as a shorted rail.\n\nAfter the repair the Touch ID button is still not functional.  I believe the button was also damaged.\nThe shorted chip and blown filter are resolved but no go on the touch ID button.\n\nAnyone else been here?"}
