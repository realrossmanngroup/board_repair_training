The machine will otherwise behave normally with no other issues. I suspect this is either one of 2 things. \n\nA. Driver issue related to a specific MacOs version \n\nOR. \n\nB. Dying Intel iGPU or a driver issue with a specific revision of the intel iGPU. \n\nIf you have seen one of these machines, or have one of these machines in your shop, could you please post the MacOs version number as well as the info under System Report - Graphics and Displays? \n\nThanks! Also curious to what others think of this. It has been bugging me lately."
