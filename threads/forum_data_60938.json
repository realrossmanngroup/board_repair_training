    "definitions": {
        "820-2915": "What is 820-2915? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "LVDS_IG_PANEL_PWR": "What is LVDS_IG_PANEL_PWR? a SIGNAL.",
        "LVDS_IG_BKL_ON": "What is LVDS_IG_BKL_ON? LVDS_IG_BKL_ON is equivalent to LCD_BKLT_EN. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "U1800": "What is U1800? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "NC_LVDS_IG_BKL_PWM": "What is NC_LVDS_IG_BKL_PWM? a SIGNAL.",
        "R2015": "What is R2015? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "LVDS_DDC_CLK": "What is LVDS_DDC_CLK? LVDS_DDC_CLK Is the DDC clock line between the graphics processor and the screen. DDC is a protocol for identifying a screen so that you know what resolution/refresh rate it wants. This is necessary for screen detection, inductor on this data line must be good and DDC voltage must be going to the LCD screen for it to work. .",
        "PP3V3_S0_LCD": "What is PP3V3_S0_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCD_PWR_EN": "What is LCD_PWR_EN? LCD_PWR_EN is a signal that tells the chip that supplies power to the LCD screen to turn on..",
        "LCD_BKLT_PWM": "What is LCD_BKLT_PWM? LCD_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "LCD_BLKT_EN": "What is LCD_BLKT_EN? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_SW_LCD": "What is PP3V3_SW_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "LVDS_DDC_DATA": "What is LVDS_DDC_DATA? LVDS_DDC_DATA Is the DDC data line between the graphics processor and the screen. DDC is a protocol for identifying a screen so that you know what resolution/refresh rate it wants. This is necessary for screen detection, inductor on this data line must be good and DDC voltage must be going to the LCD screen for it to work. .",
