            "message": "Ok, so I have my first warranty on a repair I did on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. The Initial issue was it suffered a water spill and no power. well after finding a short on PP3V42 due to <CAPACITOR>C5002</CAPACITOR> so I replaced it and boom, board worked. I UC the board, put it back together and tested for a couple hours then gave it back to customer. this was on May 6th. They now have the complaint that the board randomly shuts down. I can confirm that when i hooked up to power supply after a few minutes it will just \"die\", meaning the screen goes black. The current on the PSU shows 20mA when it dies. I took the board out to look at it and I do not see any signs of corrosion or anything. I tried to hook it up using an external monitor and external SSD and it still just shuts down. I ran HWMonitor and the sensor temps seemed acceptable. So now I am going to look for any random components I need to look at"
