        "message":"Hi there, \n\nGot 820-3437 that try to spin the fan but immediatly shut down. It seems like there is a short on S3 or S0 lines but i cant find it out. \n\n\nAll rails i checked are giving correct value. S3 and S0 rails give correct value at the moment fan tries to spin ( spin quarter and stop). Also all sys good giving 3.3 at the moment of fan spins. \n\n\nNo water damage just someone didnt screwed it well and there was a screw going up to down over logic board that must make short something somewhere. \n\n\nAny idea?"
