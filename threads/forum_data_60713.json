Someone played around with smc so i resoldered it. I also replaced U7501, there was a missing backlight IC i've soldered a new one and also replacedU7100. I  finally managed to get a green light but no power. Diode mode on R5100 pin 1 id 0.3 and pin 2 0.5 voltages also correct. I noted something strange on C7094 on pin 1 (P3V42G3H_BOOST) i have 7.2V and pin 2 is ok it's 3.4v.\nPPBUS_G3H is 0.2v\nPP5V_S5 is 0.8v\nPP3V3_S5 is 0.8v\nJ6100 removed\n\nAny ideas?  \n\nThanks :D"}

So if you had a short on U7100 then you need to replace Q7130, if you replaced U7100 without replacing Q7130 you have probably killed the new U7100. Replace both Q7130 and U7100 with new and try. Also check resistance to ground at L7310 - if it's low 1-2ohms you have got a dead processor and basically a trash board so don't waste any time if this is the case!"}
