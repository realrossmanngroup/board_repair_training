Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging.."

Only real area of corrosion was around <CHIP>U6960</CHIP> where we had <RESISTOR>R6960</RESISTOR> loose and has been replaced. All other resistors are connected and measuring normally. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.3V\nDevice is not detected in DFU mode when connected to another mac\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> is missing and is not shorted to ground\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_EN_MVR</SIGNAL> is also missing and is not shorted to ground\n<CHIP>U6960</CHIP> has been removed and resoldered - there was no corrosion underneath.\n\nUnsure about this one as 12.3v PPBUS would indicate T2 communication issue but also got missing <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> and i'm not sure if that should only come up after PPBUS voltage goes up."
