R5081 and R4902 were shorted so I replaced these.\n\nIt now turns on and gives a picture but fans are on full and no green light. I think the PCH is getting hot but am not sure what the usual operating temp for this is. I don't fix many newer MBPs.\n\nI swapped out R7010, as it was reading low, but now the new resistor is reading low too, so there must be a short near by...\n\n\nEverything seems to measure okay, but I just wanted to describe this behaviour I haven't seen before..\n\nIf I plug the charger into [B]my[\/B] laptop, it goes green. Plug it into the 820-3462, and it goes green. \n\nPlug the power into [B]my[\/B] laptop again and the light goes orange (mines a little flat now), plug it into the 820-3462 and it goes orange. :|\n\nIt seems the light does whatever it was doing last. :\/\n\nAny ideas?"}
