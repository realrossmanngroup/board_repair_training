This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  ."

I think the PCH is getting hot but am not sure what the usual operating temp for this is. I don't fix many newer MBPs.\n\nI swapped out <RESISTOR>R7010</RESISTOR>, as it was reading low, but now the new resistor is reading low too, so there must be a short near by...\n\n\nEverything seems to measure okay, but I just wanted to describe this behaviour I haven't seen before..\n\nIf I plug the charger into [B]my[/B] laptop, it goes green. Plug it into the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3462</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, and it goes green. \n\nPlug the power into [B]my[/B] laptop again and the light goes orange (mines a little flat now), plug it into the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3462</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> and it goes orange. :|\n\nIt seems the light does whatever it was doing last. :/\n\nAny ideas?"
