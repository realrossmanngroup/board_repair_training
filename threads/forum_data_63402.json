            "message": "So, I got a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00597</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> logic board to replace the one in a 2017 21.5 4K iMac.  It worked fine when I got it, powered up fine, was able to install MacOS on it.  All done on the bench of course.  I decided before putting it in the chassis to reapply the thermal paste for the CPU and GPU and look over the board to make sure there weren't any issues.  I noticed a cap had been pulled up off the board (still attached on one side) and soldered it back in place. It was part of the Ethernet circuit, I can look up the specific one if it's important.  I also decided to swap the EFI rom chip from the original board so the serial number would match.  I had done it several times before on other boards with no issues. After these several steps, I put everything back together and the logic board won't power on.  It draws ~ 0.1Amps when power is applied, drops to 0.08 amps then stays there.  Strange thing is, if I short the power pads the logic board will act like it is powering off, dropping to 0.03 amps drawn.  If I then short the power pads it will go back up to 0.1 amps and do the same thing again.  I checked that <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is being generated.  Also diagnostic LED 1 stays solid, it doesn't flicker.  None of the other LEDs come on.  Anyway, just wanted to see if anyone had any idea what might have happened to it.  I wanted to get this board working again because it's got the Radeon 560 4GB graphics."
