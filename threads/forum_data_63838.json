I was getting video prior, now I am not getting video. The board is heating up. There is quite a few audio sections that got burnt at some point but I would imagine this has nothing to do with the video?\nR3453 Pin 1 in diode mode reads 2.235. This area the diode (d3452) next to it I had to repair the traces. I get no voltage coming through.\nr7140 pin 2 is 3.3\nr7155 no voltage\nr1501 and r1503 no voltage\nq1930 1 and 2 pin no voltage"}
