        "message":"Originally water damaged and backlight pins on socket and cable we're burnt, So replaced lvds connector, cable and backlight fuse and all was ok.\n\nTested for about 10mins and turned it off, then when I went to turn it back on no image. went to check pp3v3_s0sw_lcd and L8304 was blown to bits. \nThere was no short to ground on both sides, so I replaced it and it worked again.\nThen I shut the lid and tossed the machine arround a bit and when I turned it on it just came up with a white screen. I then restarted machine and sure enough no image and L8304 was blown again. \n\nAny ideas?"
