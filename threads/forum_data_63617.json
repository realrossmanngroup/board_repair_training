The customer had the battery changed at a different shop and then brought it to us. What it would do is load up the Apple logo and then restart and repeat. If I go into internet recovery to choose the Wi-Fi and input the password, it would restart shortly after. If I go into the boot menu, it would stay on without restarting unless I choose Macintosh HD then it would start boot looping again. Customer mentioned it started happening around the time he tried to install boot camp which in my mind says it might be a software-related issue, but I am now thinking it was just a coincidence because how difficult and intermittent I am able to get into recovery and the fact that I am now seeing some weird graphical issues. Now that I restored \/ updated the T2 in DFU mode, it is able to last a little bit longer loading up the internet recovery and many times actually boot into it for me to \"Activate\". However, in internet recovery, I am unable to see any Wi-Fi networks despite seeing them in the beginning and I would not be able to activate without an internet connection.\n\nAttached are pictures of the weird graphical issues I have been seeing. Any thoughts? Would flashing the T2 a second time help or are we dealing with a hardware issue?\n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https:\/\/ibb.co\/p4XmXxm[\/URL]\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https:\/\/ibb.co\/ZcZdF74[\/URL]"}
