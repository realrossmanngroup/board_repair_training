Board looks very clean green/orange light & chime. After a check around the CPU i found both L7510 and L7550 are short to ground.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> = 0.83v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL> = 0.97 and drops to 0 a few seconds after booting.\n\nWhen following the lines in the schematics they didnt lead to anywhere, assume they both feed the CPU so its safe to say the issue is the CPU or should I check something else first? I assume these lines both link to the CPU and thus are both shorted and no need to test all resistor on each line? Please enlighten me, im not good fixing CPU issues and usually end up replacing the board :(."
