After the swap the fan on the right spins at max right when the computer is turned on. I have tried another palm rest, the original one, and a new fan it is still going full. My iphone board guy looked it over and saw what looked like a resistor labeled 2a2 that had solder balls coming out from under it. Thanks for any help!"
