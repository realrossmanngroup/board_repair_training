Cleaned up and fixed some of the pins. One of the redundant <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_KBD</SIGNAL> pins are burned and not connected, will fix later.\n\nLittle corrosion around <TRANSISTOR>Q6000</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q6050</TRANSISTOR> - insignificant amount. Cleaned up with alcohol, reflowed quickly.\nCorrosion around <CHIP>U5256</CHIP>.\nLots of corrosion around <CHIP>U8192</CHIP>, <CHIP>U8190</CHIP>, <CHIP>U1910</CHIP> - I understand there is a lot going around this area. Cleaned reflowed, replaced <RESISTOR>R1343</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R8190</RESISTOR>.\n\nFans spin\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 13.1v\nCPU Vcore is present\nGPU Vcore is present\nNo display internal or external\nUSB mouse I believe shows activity, however we need to confirm this\n\nHow do I begin troubleshooting? I don't have any donor boards for newer models yet, but they are on the way.\n\nPicture attached."

Normally the light will stay on and fade in and out as it reads/writes data, but this one will flick on and then forever off quickly.\n\nLCD connector looks clean - no corrosion or signs of liquid.\n\nExternal image is not present. I get 0.4 - 0.5 amps on the amp meter, no power cycling. CPU temperature feels normally warm."
