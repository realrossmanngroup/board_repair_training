            "message": "I've got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> logic board that suffered water damage. Board cleaned up well, may have a little corrosion around <CHIP>U9080</CHIP>. The board draws 5V 280mA when connected to a charger alone, 20V 0mA when the battery is connected. Behavior is the same on all 4 USB-C ports. I measured all the usual suspects and nothing seems off.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.34V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.31V\n<SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS</SIGNAL> 5.24V\n<SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> 3.40V\n<SIGNAL>PP0V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> 0.8V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> 1.1V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> 1.8V\n\nI was really hoping it was a T2 firmware issue. I can get the board into DFU mode, but it's seen as a generic \"Apple Controller\" in Apple Configurator 2.6 on a Mac mini. The mini complains \"Cannot use thunderbolt accessory\" when first connected. Could it be a cable issue?\n\nSymptoms seem similar to this thread [URL]https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/59438/[/URL]. I checked all <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> LDO outputs in diode mode and got readings ranging 0.43V-0.48V. Replacing the CD3215s seems to issue in that instance. Is there anything else I should check/try first?"
