Then i realized that c7526 area was getting supper hot and must be the reason ppbus is being held down.  the problem im having is finding out what is causing the c7526 area to get hot or short to gnd.  i looked around to see if anything was connecting ppbus_s5 to gnd but i cannot seem to figure it out.  i checked and replaced all the components to ppbus_s5 in the c7526 area and still cannot seem to stop it from heating. i checked & replaced q7520&10 & c7517. (i know why replace it if its are good, but after not finding the issue i started replacing everything in the area for good measures.)  i am attaching a photo of the damaged area. i took the c7562 off for the photo.  and i tried powering without the c7560 and my wire attached and still flares up to temp.  recorded temps up past 250 Fahrenheit."}
