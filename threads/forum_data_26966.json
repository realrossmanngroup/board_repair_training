        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

            "message": "got in liquid damaged 3115. <CAPACITOR>C7526</CAPACITOR> was completely burned off the board. ran a wire there and changed out a few components around it.  smc area seemed to have green corrosion, already did a reflow.  first i checked one wire.  im getting 3.34v on <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, i have .19v on <CHIP>U6900</CHIP> pins 4 and 5.  Then i realized that <CAPACITOR>C7526</CAPACITOR> area was getting supper hot and must be the reason ppbus is being held down.  the problem im having is finding out what is causing the <CAPACITOR>C7526</CAPACITOR> area to get hot or short to gnd.  i looked around to see if anything was connecting <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5</SIGNAL> to gnd but i cannot seem to figure it out.  i checked and replaced all the components to <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5</SIGNAL> in the <CAPACITOR>C7526</CAPACITOR> area and still cannot seem to stop it from heating. i checked & replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR>&10 & <CAPACITOR>C7517</CAPACITOR>. (i know why replace it if its are good, but after not finding the issue i started replacing everything in the area for good measures.)  i am attaching a photo of the damaged area. i took the <CAPACITOR>C7562</CAPACITOR> off for the photo.  and i tried powering without the <CAPACITOR>C7560</CAPACITOR> and my wire attached and still flares up to temp.  recorded temps up past 250 Fahrenheit."
