            "message": "Am struggling a little today with this board and need some clearheaded suggestions; had a couple in a row and can't think straight:)\n\nBoard might have had some work done on it, but i think i spotted all the mistakes (some coils of PMIC were taken off, but so far i don't know why, nothing else seemed missing.)\nall USBC ports draw 5V steady and seem to have all their LDOs out of the port controllers.\n\nPPBus was cycling quickly from 0 to 12.3V, along with <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> constantly trying to come up with some voltage (too quick to read)\nI first removed <RESISTOR>R9707</RESISTOR>: Enable for <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> was cycling as well, so i took it off and then PPBUS Stabilizes to 12.3V\nI then thought my <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> was bad (also because it looked to be cycling up to 2.7V and not to 3.3V, which is odd), diode-mode on <CAPACITOR>C6912</CAPACITOR> was reading just a little low as well so i replaced <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> (for the second time), and put back <RESISTOR>R9707</RESISTOR>:\nNow output at <CAPACITOR>C6912</CAPACITOR> is again cycling from 0 - 2.7V, as well as PPBUS cycling again.\n\ni took off <RESISTOR>R6934</RESISTOR>/35 to see if there was a difference, and when these fuses are off, i get steady 3.3V at <CAPACITOR>C6912</CAPACITOR>.\nI then thought, there must be a short after <RESISTOR>R6934</RESISTOR>/35 on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL>, but i cant find it, diode mode is OK at around .380\n\nany idea what is causing this, or am i missing some steps?\nThanks in advance!"
