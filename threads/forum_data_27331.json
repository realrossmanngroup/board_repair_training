Cannot find anything else getting hot. I'm always cautious injecting voltage, should i raise it higher ?\nI suspect CPU shorted to ground pulling these low or a short in the board but would appreciate and insight!  Thanks,"}

Shorted Q7510\/30\/50. Replace the shorted FET and the driver it is connected to, but CPU is most likely dead."}

Q7550 pin 4 was part of the problem (burnt underneath) - short follows back through Q7551 pins 1\/2 - removed Q7551. Short still present on pads 7\/8 - assuming CPU is very dead"}
