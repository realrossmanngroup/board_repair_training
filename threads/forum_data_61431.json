Isolated to blown U9080. Replaced the blown chip and now have 20v power, but board still won't power up. Isolated to U8900 with a short, about 1.5ohms on PP2V5_NAND_SSD0 line. After removing U8900, resistance on that line is now 20ohms. Is this too lower or normal? If normal, can i disable U8900 so that i can leave the chip out of the board?"}

If I replace the ssd modules with another from identical board, will I run into issues with the T2 firmware bricking the board?"}
