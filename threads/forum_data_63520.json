        "A2289": "What is A2289? A2289 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2020 with EMC 3456, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01987..",
        "PP1V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V8_SLPS2R? PP1V8_SLPS2R is a 1.8v power rail present when the system is in a SLPS2R state. .",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V1_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V1_SLPS2R? The PP1V1_SLPS2R power rail in the MacBook schematic provides a 1.1-volt supply in a specific low-power state indicated by the \"_SLPS2R\" suffix and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP1V2_AWAKE": "What is PP1V2_AWAKE? The PP1V2_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides 1.2 volts and is associated with the machine's awake state and is used for powering the T2 chip..",

            "message": "Prior to putting in DFU this board had liquid damage to LCD backlight area. That was solved and I could see cycling of power rails. I could see .8V on CPU rails cycling power briefly. So I thought maybe T2 issue. Was able to get it in DFU mode and have tried restoring the T2. It gets to 4th step then fans come on high and i get this error: \n\nThe operation couldn’t be completed. (AMRestoreErrorDomain error 9 - Failed to receive message from device, might be connection problem with USB host. (Communication error, possibly USB disconnection)) [AMRestoreErrorDomain – 0x9 (9)]\n\nNow it seems to be stuck in DFU all of the time. Now when i plug it to power it stops at 20.4V and 0 amps.  Prior it would cycle the wattage and amps but wouldn't boot. I'm not seeing any signs of more issues on the board."
