            "message": "Hi all,\n\nwe’ve got a 2021 MacBook Pro 14 inch in with coffee damage. There was not really any corrosion luckily just a bit of sticky residue over the passives around the hdmi area. I cleaned all that up checked and there seem to be no shorts on the areas with the liquid residue. Caps aren’t shorted, inductors seem fine and resistors measure how they should.\n\nHowever there is a zero ohm short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL>. 0.1v diode mode on pPbus measures at CR857.There is no further signs of liquid/damaged components on the board, and where there was liquid is no where near/ and is not connected to <SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> so that’s strange. Is there anything else I should be checking before connecting the MagSafe and going down the power sequences?\n\nI’ve attached photos of the liquid damaged areas,apologises for the quality my phones cameras not what it used to be. \n\nthanks![ATTACH type=\"full\"]61011[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]61011[/ATTACH]"
