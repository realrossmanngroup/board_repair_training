We tested USB C port and the results are below: \n\n1. when the board on Apple MacBook Pro connected to the battery --> 20v 0.05amps. Amps goes up to 0.60-0.70 and loops back to 0amps and again again. \n2. when board directly connect to the charging cable --> 20v 0.05amps\n\nIn this situation where we should start from to test and measure voltage. Does it look like firmware corruption T2 level or looks like to certain chips\/elements shorted?\n\nPlease advise. Thank you. \n\nRegards,\nZack"}
