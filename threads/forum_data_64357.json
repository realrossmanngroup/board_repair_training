        "A1990": "What is A1990? A1990 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2018, 2019 with EMC3215, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01041, 820-01814..",
        "820-01041": "What is 820-01041? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V3_G3H_RTC": "What is 3V3_G3H_RTC? 3V3_G3H_RTC Is an abbreviation of PP3V3_G3H_RTC which is one of the first rails that has to come on in order for the USB-C mux chip to be powered in the T2 chip Macbook Pros..",
        "PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X": "What is PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X? a SIGNAL.",

        "PP1V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V8_SLPS2R? PP1V8_SLPS2R is a 1.8v power rail present when the system is in a SLPS2R state. .",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V2_AWAKE": "What is PP1V2_AWAKE? The PP1V2_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides 1.2 volts and is associated with the machine's awake state and is used for powering the T2 chip..",

We tested USB C port and the results are below: \n\n1. when the board on Apple MacBook Pro connected to the battery --> 20v 0.05amps. Amps goes up to 0.60-0.70 and loops back to 0amps and again again. \n2. when board directly connect to the charging cable --> 20v 0.05amps\n\nIn this situation where we should start from to test and measure voltage. Does it look like firmware corruption T2 level or looks like to certain chips/elements shorted?\n\nPlease advise. Thank you. \n\nRegards,\nZack"
