            "message": "Hey Hey!! Back again with another stooooopid question. <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>.... liquid ingress ( chicken soup). No power. Plug in charger. Green to Orange. Stays on orange. Not powering on. Did SMC reset, powers on... boots fully. everything working fine in respect of keyboard, wifi etc. However, battery indicator shows an X and as soon as the O/S boots the charger goes green. says battery is low. stays powered on though until charger is disconnected. You can power down through the normal sequence with no issues. When powered down, the charger stays green. If the charger is disconnected with the unit powered off  and reconnected the LED goes green to orange and stays orange as though charging. Left for 30 mins powered off. Powered back on and as soon as O/S boots it goes back to green and reports battery low, with an X. In system information it shows no battery info. In power settings says battery at 0%. Removed installed 256gb SSD and installed a new O/S on a 128gb SSD with the same results.\n\nSo, question is, I suspect it requires a new battery as there is a little corrosion under the black cover on the battery itself. But before I obtain the battery, is there any tests/ where I can check to see why the battery is not being detected or charging for any other reason.\n\nLogic board is clean. I can see no signs of corrosion on the board anywhere. Looks like in some respects the owner has been lucky, even down to the keyboard still working.\n\nI look forward to any assistance from you, the guru's of the apple repair world :)\n\nMarc"

            "message": "[USER=\"682\"]2informaticos[/USER] I do not have another battery to hand. In respect of PC's, I do use Chinese imports as they are not so unruly with PC equipment, but always buy original for Apple products. Unfortunately, the cost of the battery here is Â£80-100 and I don't wish to buy one just yet without checking first. I will check the SCL/SDA lines.\n\n[USER=\"1153\"]JohnB8812[/USER] I will do the check now. I have checked around the SMC under a microscope and I can't believe how clean it is. In all honesty, if I did not know better, I would say it has gone somewhere else first and they cleaned it. But the whole inner case is clean.\n\nOnly other thing to add, which I have found out since I made the first post, I have been asked to do a clean install of the OSx. Now, as disclosed on a previous post I have a USB with multiple images on. I have tried all the images and getting the same error. It will not install as the unit is saying the charger is not connected, however I know it is because the unit is powered on without the battery connected.\n\nI will check the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> lines and the SDA/SCL now and report back."
