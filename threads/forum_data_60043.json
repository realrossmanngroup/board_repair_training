REsistors R131X all look good. Tried multiple I\/O in boards and cables to no avail. It looks like most of the lines from j9500 go directly to the PCH. I've been bitten by the PCH snake a few times lately. \n\nChecked connections at bottom of J9500 and that they are pinging at cable connection end. I have PP1V5_S0SW_Audio at J9500 also."
