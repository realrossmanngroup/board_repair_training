        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4": "What is PM_SLP_S4? This is a typo of PM_SLP_S4_L When you see PM_SLP_S4, assume they meant to type PM_SLP_S4_L.",

        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",

Upon further inspection it looks to not be making it to an s0 state as cpu and gpu are ice cold and has no vcore. I know i have at least <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> Only signs of liquid on the board on on the right side near touch bar connector. This is the first T2 board i've worked on."
