The Battery Management circuit could be damaged.  I see this a lot in water damaged machines. \nCheck the voltage at the battery terminals with the power attached. Then check the battery plug with the battery unplugged.   If it's dead there is your issue.\n\nThere is a fuse on the battery management board \"requires you tear into the battery\" that has ultra low melting point solder in it.  I have seen these fail.   I harvest these fuses for the solder and use it at chipquik.\n\nIf you have verified that the battery is good check the BMIC lines.  In my experience it is usually the battery it's self."}
