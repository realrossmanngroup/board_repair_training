Came in for no image on display, but when i first power it on, it worked just fine until I changed the energy saving setting to always use the AMD GPU and not the Intel. As soon as I made the change, and it switch to black screen. \ni was going to replace <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> but decided to replace <CHIP>U9300</CHIP> first which didn't fix it. \n\nMy question, can i use a <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> chip from a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> or <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00426</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board or as an alternative, i can purchase this chip from DigiKey.com?\nOn the schematic, apple part numbers  341S3565 and 337S4313 match on both the 3332 and 3787. Plus the spec info from BOM page matches DigiKey.com."
