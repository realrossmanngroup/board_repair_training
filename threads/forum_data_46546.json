It actually turns on fine but PPBUS drops to 11.4-11.6v instantly. If i then plug in the charger, it won't charge or light up the magsafe until one of two things happen.. either PPBU_G3H creeps up to 11.84-11.85v and then the charger comes on and it jumps to 12.5v or if it doesn't creep up, if I turn off the MacBook, it usually initiates the voltage creep up to 11.84v-11.85v at which point it jumps to 12.5 once it sees the 11.84v"}

What is your exact voltage on PPBUS_G3H with just the charger now battery? Check resistance between pins 17\/18 and 27\/28 of the ISL6259."}

Checked around U6900\/01 under the microscope and it all looks perfect unfortunately.\n\nJust to be clear. When PPBUS_G3H is below 11.84v (usually around 11-11.4v when just on battery) the magsafe light doesn't come on and the battery doesn't charge. But when PPBUS_G3H is 11.84v or above, the magsafe light does come on and the battery charges perfectly."}
