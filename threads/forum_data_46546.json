CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H.

This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

It actually turns on fine but PPBUS drops to 11.4-11.6v instantly. If i then plug in the charger, it won't charge or light up the magsafe until one of two things happen.. either <SIGNAL>PPBU_G3H</SIGNAL> creeps up to 11.84-11.85v and then the charger comes on and it jumps to 12.5v or if it doesn't creep up, if I turn off the MacBook, it usually initiates the voltage creep up to 11.84v-11.85v at which point it jumps to 12.5 once it sees the 11.84v"
