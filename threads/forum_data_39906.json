        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7005": "What is D7005? a DIODE.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "D7012": "What is D7012? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year model macbook airs, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",
        "D7010": "What is D7010? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year retina model macbook pros, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input.
