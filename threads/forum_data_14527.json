Apparently something is going on with this board when it gets hit by liquid in that area. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm really hoping to avoid starting a collection of booting 2015 Retina boards with no keyboard/trackpad."

This model has an odd system where the keyboard doesn't work without a trackpad present - unlike the old pros, and similar to the Airs except the keyboard doesn't run through the trackpad. I'm wondering if the interaction that allows the keyboard to work is somehow being hindered by something in the trackpad circuit."
