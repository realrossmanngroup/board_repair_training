        "A1465": "What is A1465? A1465 is a model number for a 11 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2924, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00164, 820-3208, 820-3435..",
        "820-00164": "What is 820-00164? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U4600": "What is U4600? a CHIP.",
        "U5490": "What is U5490? a CHIP.",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "R5490": "What is R5490? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",
        "Q7707": "What is Q7707? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing."
