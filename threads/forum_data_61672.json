        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO": "What is PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO? PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on..",
        "PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC": "What is PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC? PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad..",
        "PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD": "What is PP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD? PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing chip. When this is missing, either a capacitor on the line has shorted, PP3V3_G3H is missing, or the CD3215 is bad..",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H? This is the input from the USB-C charger or the battery that is the input voltage for the chip responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H. It can be missing when capacitors on this line are shorted to ground, or when the diode in front of it leading to the chip that creates PP3V3_G3H is blown. .",

This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad. Each CD3215 in the system needs to be functioning in order for any of them to speak to the charger and negotiate receiving 20v from the charger rather than the default 5v that a USB-C charger puts out before communicating with the system. .",

        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
