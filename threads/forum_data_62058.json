        "message":"Hi, macbook came with video problems, when power up it shows the apple logo, when booting progress bar is about halfway, video start looking funny, like image is double, then the cursor arrow shows up and background image goes and come, but arrow or loading cursor the multicolor circle shows without a problem.\n\nWhen the password screen shows, image disappears and appears randomly, also backlight changes intensity several times, cursor moves slow, is very difficult to type de password, it don't register every key while typing.\n\nAfter you can pass all that screens, it shows your desktop screen, at first the screen keeps blinking and dimming, but after a minute or two image becomes stable, also cursor and keyboard speed becomes normal.\n\nCustomer said he open the macbook, and change the dc-inboard, he thinks he may hit with the screwdriver the lcd connector.\n\nLCD connector, didn't look well, so was replaced.\nConnector pins shows 3.3V, no pulses.\nAlso test another screen, and same problem, so its no the screen or the LDVS flex.  \nAlso change L9080 just in case was that the problem.\n\nI run out of ideas, any suggestion of what to do?"
