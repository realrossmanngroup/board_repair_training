            "message": "Hi Guys,\n\nI'm back! :) but a little out of practice with the board repair thought process.\n\n\nThis board, originally it came in with a blown ground trace on <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> which I repaired. The repair ended up being abandoned at it found a new home as my shop computer.\n\nAbout two weeks ago I rebooted and it stuck on a black screen with a backlight, about 15 minutes later it finally chimed. A day later it decided to not resume from sleep and has pretty much never turned on again. Originally the CPU was getting warm and the fan would spin up, USB mouse had a red light. So it seemed alive, just never completed a post.\n\nNow it's totally dead with a cycling <SIGNAL>SLP_S5</SIGNAL> @ <RESISTOR>R1460</RESISTOR>.\nAll the all measurements around <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> are bouncing too, but I think this might be a symptom of the real issue.\n\nAny help appreciated."
