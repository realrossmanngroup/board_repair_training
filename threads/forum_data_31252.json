The repair ended up being abandoned at it found a new home as my shop computer.\n\nAbout two weeks ago I rebooted and it stuck on a black screen with a backlight, about 15 minutes later it finally chimed. A day later it decided to not resume from sleep and has pretty much never turned on again. Originally the CPU was getting warm and the fan would spin up, USB mouse had a red light. So it seemed alive, just never completed a post.\n\nNow it's totally dead with a cycling SLP_S5 @ R1460.\nAll the all measurements around U1900 are bouncing too, but I think this might be a symptom of the real issue.\n\nAny help appreciated."}

You will need to replace every single semiconductor on the 3V42 rail, I guess about 10 parts total, including Hall sensor for lid. \nUse search function for SMC stencil, has been linked to multiple times in the past."}
