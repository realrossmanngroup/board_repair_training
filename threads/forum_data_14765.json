I'll post this in case anyone else has a board like this.\n\nSomeone had removed <CAPACITOR>C7583</CAPACITOR> and torn the pad connecting to <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL>...\nThe connecting via comes from that pad through the very thin trace / pad of <CAPACITOR>C7583</CAPACITOR>. no idea if this is common but it may help someone if board has been fucked by customer."
