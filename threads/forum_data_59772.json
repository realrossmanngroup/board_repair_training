The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",

I have replaced the SMC but no changes , where else can I check ? am hoping I do not have to worry about the CPU/PCH , please help guys"
