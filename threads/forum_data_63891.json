Stuck at 5V. After inspection I discovered the 2 left USB-C ports keep resetting the charger. After some measurements I found that \nPP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOD is giving around 3V instead of expected 1.8V. I then replaced U3100 as it's the component that generates this voltage, but got same result. All other 3 controllers have correct 1.8V on their equivalent line. Any ideas on what could be causing this anomaly?"}
