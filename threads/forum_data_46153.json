        "message":"Liquid damage pretty extensively on the I\/O board, but the main logic board was mostly untouched--only slight corrosion around U7330, nothing on backside.\nCleaned her up, no change in magsafe (goes green, then amber), fans do not whir. All main power rails are there, PP5V_S0 and PP3V3_S0 are virtually not there, at .001 or 0.0mv. ALL_SYS_PWRGOOD is also missing, as you could guess, 0.0v.\nDiode mode shows .286v for 3v3_S0, .388v for 5V_S0, so no shorts on those lines I think. Not sure where they are created, that'd be my next path.\nWould Q8131 be suspect? I'm getting a healthy 3.3\/3.4v on CHGR_VFRQ but nothing coming out of pin 1, PM_SLP_S3_R_L. I think that because U8180, the 'S0 enable' chip, has a healthy 3.3v on pin 5, but absolutely nothing on the other pins, including PM_SLP_S3_BUF_L."
