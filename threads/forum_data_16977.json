I could see the HDD, but the system was corrupted. I ve partitionned the HDD and put it on the macbook but I got the same issue.\n\n2- On this stage I thought it should be the cable, then I ve used a working hdd from another installed macbook, the macbook started normally. This has confirmed to me that the data cable has not problem.\n\n3- I ve used another working hdd and partitionned it by use of another macbook. And tried it again on the customer macbook. And again I got a flashing question mark.\n\nWhat can be the problem?\n\nGreeting"}

If hdd1 partitionned by use of another macbook and when placed on the customer machine still give the flashing question mark. \n\nThat s why I ve tooked HDD2 which confirmed to me that the cable is working fine, otherwise it will not boot up normally.\n\nAnd yes I ve checked the state of the connectors at both side on the cable self and also on the board."}
