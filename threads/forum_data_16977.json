            "message": "Hello;\n\nI ve got a macbook that shows a flashing question mark inside a folder after not succeeding loading the OS from the HDD.\n\nTo my knowledge this can be a HDD or data cable issue!\n\n1- I ve tried to read this HDD by use of an USB casing connected to another macbook. I could see the HDD, but the system was corrupted. I ve partitionned the HDD and put it on the macbook but I got the same issue.\n\n2- On this stage I thought it should be the cable, then I ve used a working hdd from another installed macbook, the macbook started normally. This has confirmed to me that the data cable has not problem.\n\n3- I ve used another working hdd and partitionned it by use of another macbook. And tried it again on the customer macbook. And again I got a flashing question mark.\n\nWhat can be the problem?\n\nGreeting"
