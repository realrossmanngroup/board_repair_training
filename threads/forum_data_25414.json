Noticed the airport connector and card was melted. Didn't have a connector so I soldered jumpers to the board. Ghetto? Yes absolutely but it works.\n\nAnyway.. Still no bluetooth. I'm pretty sure I just have to replace u3510 and maybe q3510 but I also think their is a chance that the PCH is messed up.\n\nHere are my findings\n\nBT_WAKE 0v\nSMC_PME_WAKE_L 3.31v\nUSB_BT_P 3.3v\nUSB_BT_N 0v...... I know this comes from PCH. If the PCH is screwed up I am guessing I could jump 3v here and restore function? (EDIT: This is why I should not be working on boards half asleep. This is a bi directional data line and jumping 3.3v here would be a stupid move.) \nUSB_BT_CONN_N 0v\nUSB_BT_CONN_P 3.3v.\n\nOther than a finstack sensor error (Now resolved) the board works."}

Only thing needed for BT to work are J3501 pins 16,17,18 and a good U3510."}

Going to hook up pins 6 + 7 to spare data lines."}
