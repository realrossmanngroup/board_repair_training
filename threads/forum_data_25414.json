Didn't have a connector so I soldered jumpers to the board. Ghetto? Yes absolutely but it works.\n\nAnyway.. Still no bluetooth. I'm pretty sure I just have to replace <CHIP>U3510</CHIP> and maybe <TRANSISTOR>Q3510</TRANSISTOR> but I also think their is a chance that the PCH is messed up.\n\nHere are my findings\n\n<SIGNAL>BT_WAKE</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_PME_WAKE_L</SIGNAL> 3.31v\n<SIGNAL>USB_BT_P</SIGNAL> 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>USB_BT_N</SIGNAL> 0v...... I know this comes from PCH. If the PCH is screwed up I am guessing I could jump 3v here and restore function? (EDIT: This is why I should not be working on boards half asleep. This is a bi directional data line and jumping 3.3v here would be a stupid move.) \n<SIGNAL>USB_BT_CONN_N</SIGNAL> 0v\n<SIGNAL>USB_BT_CONN_P</SIGNAL> 3.3v.\n\nOther than a finstack sensor error (Now resolved) the board works."
