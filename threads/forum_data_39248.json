Replaced and ran trace. I installed the os and gave it to customer telling him i couldn't check it (he was in a huge hurry and didn't want to wait for me to run asd)\n\nlaptop was brought back to me with Ethernet, 1 USB , Display Port and firewire not working. I looked over the board in a little more detail and found. \n\nU9480 was missing and C9416 and C9412 broken\/missing. Replaced all three.  This fixed everything but thunderbolt\/display port and Ethernet .   Ran ASD and it passes\n\nProblem is that Ethernet is found in os, but it wont connect to router. i don't even get green light on the router that its plugged in."}

Don't buy boards on Ebay, or if you must just file a not as described claim. You decided to fix so now you own it..\nI would never fix a 2533 machine if the original board was FUBAR, just too old now."}
