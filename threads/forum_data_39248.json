            "message": "None of my suppliers had an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2533</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a board in stock so i was stuck taking my chances on ebay. went through three of \"pulled from a working laptop\" before i found one that was halfway decent.\n\nL4502 was burned/corded (not sure which) to hell and pad 2 was gone. Replaced and ran trace. I installed the os and gave it to customer telling him i couldn't check it (he was in a huge hurry and didn't want to wait for me to run asd)\n\nlaptop was brought back to me with Ethernet, 1 USB , Display Port and firewire not working. I looked over the board in a little more detail and found. \n\n<CHIP>U9480</CHIP> was missing and <CAPACITOR>C9416</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C9412</CAPACITOR> broken/missing. Replaced all three.  This fixed everything but thunderbolt/display port and Ethernet .   Ran ASD and it passes\n\nProblem is that Ethernet is found in os, but it wont connect to router. i don't even get green light on the router that its plugged in."
