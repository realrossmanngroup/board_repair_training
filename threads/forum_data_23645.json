I then replaced the U7000, Q7080, Q7085, Q7030, Q7035, U74000. After removing the ISL I also made sure that all of the Current Sense resistors were good. Now I connect the MagSafe only no DC Power supply and get the Green light but no fan. There are no 5v or 3v rails and PPBUS_G3H is 0.170v @ F7040."}

This has now introduced a whole bunch of uncertainties.\n\nFirst thing to check would be resistance to GND on PPBUS, then resistance between pins 17\/18 27\/28 of U7000. Then check R7005."}

If there still is no 12V on L7030 there is an issue around U7000, bad soldering\/dead U7000."}
