This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",

I have all rails present apart from the following :\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>\nPPVCCEDRAM_S0_CPU\n<SIGNAL>PP0V6_S0_DDRVTT</SIGNAL>\n\nI believe the last 2 won't have any voltages until the top 2 are working.\n\nBoth the top 2 come from the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>\n\nI've check the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and I have:\n\nSDA - 1v\nSCLK - 1v\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> - 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>CPUVR_PGOOD</SIGNAL> - 3.3v\nboth VIN & VCC have the correct voltages.\n\nFor shit's and giggles I change the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> this didn't make any difference.\n\nNext I've looked at the <CHIP>U7210</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7220</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7410</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7420</CHIP> & <CHIP>U7430</CHIP>\n\nAll of them have 2.5v on the PWM line, 0.00v on the FCCM line and the correct voltages on VCC, VIN, PVCC.\n\nOn <CHIP>U7270</CHIP> (<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>) which is working. I get 5.0v on both PWM and FCCM and Vout of 1.02v (schematics says Vout 0.55 - 1.15v)\n\nSo maybe with <SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> working and with all Vin voltage present this rules out the <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>.\n\nInitially as mentioned this was liquid damaged and had a short to ground on the <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> which was causing PPBUS to short. I changed this and now I have all the power rails.\n\nNot sure what to check next.[/INDENT]"
