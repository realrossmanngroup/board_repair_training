        "message":"[INDENT]Liquid damaged 820-00923 using 820-00293 Schematics and BV. I have all rails present apart from the following :\n\nPPVCC_S0_CPU\nPPVCCGT_S0_CPU\nPPVCCEDRAM_S0_CPU\nPP0V6_S0_DDRVTT\n\nI believe the last 2 won't have any voltages until the top 2 are working.\n\nBoth the top 2 come from the U7100\n\nI've check the U7100 and I have:\n\nSDA - 1v\nSCLK - 1v\nALL_SYS_PWRGD - 3.3v\nCPUVR_PGOOD - 3.3v\nboth VIN & VCC have the correct voltages.\n\nFor shit's and giggles I change the U7100 this didn't make any difference.\n\nNext I've looked at the U7210, U7220, U7410, U7420 & U7430\n\nAll of them have 2.5v on the PWM line, 0.00v on the FCCM line and the correct voltages on VCC, VIN, PVCC.\n\nOn U7270 (PPVCCSA_S0_CPU) which is working. I get 5.0v on both PWM and FCCM and Vout of 1.02v (schematics says Vout 0.55 - 1.15v)\n\nSo maybe with PPVCCSA_S0_CPU working and with all Vin voltage present this rules out the U7100.\n\nInitially as mentioned this was liquid damaged and had a short to ground on the U7210 which was causing PPBUS to short. I changed this and now I have all the power rails.\n\nNot sure what to check next.[\/INDENT]"
