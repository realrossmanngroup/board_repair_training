So far tried known good trackpad and cable. Replaced <CHIP>U5511</CHIP> <TRANSISTOR>Q5050</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q5520</TRANSISTOR>. Continuity from <TRANSISTOR>Q5520</TRANSISTOR> to <CHIP>U5511</CHIP> is good. <RESISTOR>R5511</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5522</RESISTOR> both measure the same 9.8 ohms.\n\nwhat needs to be checked next? See picture for details"
