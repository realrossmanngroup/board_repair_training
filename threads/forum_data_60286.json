PPBUS was 8.20 so i changed 8.60 and now it is turning on. After that the battery wasnt detected and ISL 17\/18 wasnt ok, so i changed it too. \n\nNow when u7100 area is a little hot it is starting and detecting battery and run from battery, but if it is cold, the battery is detecting than not detecting ( on login screen it is changing from \"X\" on battery icon to 100% sometimes 1%, sometimes 7% every 2-3 seconds). \n\n\nP.S. SMC had been changed twice from donor good know board, ISL6529 first i installed new one, than take another from donor board."}

Any idea what does it mean?"}
