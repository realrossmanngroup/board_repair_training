It had liquid damage and has a new keyboard. The board it shelf looks very clean. No evidence of water there. Same thing if i want so reinstall the OS. But Apple Logo and Boot device selection menu is displayed perfectly fine as long as i want (did not turn white after some time). Can this be related to C9560? i measured voltage and for a few seconds it is 1.5V as it should be but than it turns into 1,355V and stays there.\nThanks for any help!\nRegards\nFelix"}

If the board and machine has been cleaned well enough you should take it to Apple for a free repair under the GPU warranty program."}

Make sure it is as clean as possible. Maybe post a link to a good HiRes picture here so I can judge if this is going to be rejected."}
