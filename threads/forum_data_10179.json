Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

It had liquid damage and has a new keyboard. The board it shelf looks very clean. No evidence of water there. Same thing if i want so reinstall the OS. But Apple Logo and Boot device selection menu is displayed perfectly fine as long as i want (did not turn white after some time). Can this be related to <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR>? i measured voltage and for a few seconds it is 1.5V as it should be but than it turns into 1,355V and stays there.\nThanks for any help!\nRegards\nFelix"
