            "message": "Morning all.... as usual, I am stuck.\nSo, MBA <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>- liquid ingress. Initial presentation... no boot, no power, no magsafe LED.\nOpened up, JTAG corroded- removed- pads cleaned.\n<CHIP>U5110</CHIP>- corroded- removed, pads cleaned, <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> put back on from a donor board.\nI now get <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>.... I get fan spin ( like a loon). When connected back to the screen I get the folder symbol. Connect customers SSD, boots to O/S. Still no magsafe LED. Battery symbol shows 52% on login screen but unable tio get to desktop as customer has not given correct password, so I go to guest account and although the battery symbol shows 52% it shows charger not connected. When left the % rises which would indicate to me it is charging. I have done a PRAM and SMC reset ( as far as I can tell the SMC reset may not have got through as no LED on magsafe). But now, when I connect the magsafe it goes straight to orange... no green. However this is not all the time. Sometimes it will remain off but the MBA will power on and boot to the login screen. After about 3-5 mins the magsafe will go orange. And I have swapped to 2 other adapter, both genuine apple.\n\nI have swapped the <TRANSISTOR>Q6060</TRANSISTOR> and now the fan spin rises and falls as the cpu temp changes.. so I suspect I have sorted that as well.\n\nThings to add but may/ maynot be relevent:-\n<CHIP>U5110</CHIP>\npin 1= 3.45v\npin 2= gnd\npin 3= 3.448v\npin 4= 2.72v\npin 5= 3.41v ---- when testing the voltage on this pin the MBA will restart ( fan stops, then about 2 secs after probe removed fan spins)\npin 6= 3.42v\npin 7= 3.44v\npin 8= 3.315v\n\nNow, I am also curious... 3.44 to 3.45 on the 3.42v rail..... am i being paranoid?\n\nNo other corrosion present on the board.\n\nReplaced DC in board with another known good and also trackpad ribbon had a bit of corrosion and this has also been swapped.\nOn occasion, after doing the PRAM reset I get a no backlight issue. But pulling the battery and adapter off and replaceing them, power on the screen energises and the image can be seen. When there is no illumination placing a torch I can see the display so it is the backlight not an image issue.\n\nBTW, just to add, I have got a new meter.... did a quick test for short to ground on pin 5 and I get a reading of .5347v... is that good or bad. Reason i tested here for a short was because of the restarting when testing the voltage.\n\nAny words of advice please.\nThanks in advance....\nMarc"
