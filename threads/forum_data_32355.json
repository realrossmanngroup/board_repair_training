        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",

It also makes a ticking noise.\n\nI have put a new ISL on so far and tried a different magsafe board.\n\non PP3V42 i have = 3.481v which i assume is okay...\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is = 12.27v\n\nOn <CHIP>U6900</CHIP> pin 1 (<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL>) i get 3.37v then it goes up to 3.4 then back down?\n\nOn <SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> i get the same thing 3.37v then up to 3.4\n\nAny ideas where i can go next?"
