        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

What software do you recommend to use with it 'AsProgrammer'  or the 'CH341A' utility.\n\nAlso I can't seem to find a link to a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00164</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> BIOS, appreciate if you can assist with this."

I added the battery to the motherboard, noticed the Easy Flash light turned a dim 'blue'.\n    Step 3. powered the motherboard via the apple charger, noticed the Easy Flash light was a bit brighter 'blue'.\n    Step 4. I plugged in the USB cable to the Medusa-2.\n\n     With the switches set to the default setting of mode 0, all of them off. The display showed either 'No chip seen (L)' or 'No chip seen (H)'.\n\nI know that I checked all the SPI BIOS Termination resistors, so am I to assume that I might have missed a bad trace?"
