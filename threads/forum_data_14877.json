It gives me a backlight and thin white line down the bottom. Like the image has been compressed into a 2px high line. It is also doing a scan effect with the backlight. Hard to explain and I can't get a picture of it.\n\nCustomer is losing his mind over this one. :/\nBut I just can't seem to get the picture back."

On pin 2 or pin 3?\n\nMost likely short is coming from lvds J9000 connector. Inspect pin 18 and 19 on j9000."
