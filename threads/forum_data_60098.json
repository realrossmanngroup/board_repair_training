It was badly rusted near SMC so I tried to replace the SMC. But After SMC replacement every thing works fine except sound output. i have tried new speaker and I\/O board and SMC reset. I have no idea where to start for this problem. I did visual inspection of U8040 and nearby area looks good. \n\nThanks in advance for your support."}
