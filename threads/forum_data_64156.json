        "A1278": "What is A1278? A1278 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook or Macbook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2254, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2327, 820-2530, 820-2879, 820-2936, 820-3115..",

This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC is a voltage that is created if SMC_BC_ACOK & PP3V42_G3H are both present that powers the chipset for the onewire circuit that allows the SMC to talk to the charger on the SYS_ONEWIRE line.

            "message": "TLDR: Aside from replacing the DC IN board, does anything below indicate need to replace <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> IC? Is there a way to test the charger (60W) to see if the cable needs replacing? (No fraying or exposed wiring, but the cord bends too easily just outside the rubber nipple at the brick.)\n\nI have a 2011 13\" MBP that won't charge or power on. I can't find any usable voltage anywhere on the board so I tested the DC IN board (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2565</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A, which looks rough). Here's what I got:\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]Pin[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]Name[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]Volts[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]Ohms[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B]Continuity\n to Ground[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B](Unplugged)\n Cont to Gnd[/B][/TD]\n[TD][B](Unplugged)\n Ohms[/B][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]1[/TD]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPV18V5_DCIN_FUSE</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[TD].3[/TD]\n[TD]Yes[/TD]\n[TD]No[/TD]\n[TD]1.85M[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]2[/TD]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>PPV18V5_DCIN_FUSE</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[TD].3[/TD]\n[TD]Yes[/TD]\n[TD]No[/TD]\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]3[/TD]\n[TD]GND[/TD]\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[TD].1[/TD]\n[TD]Yes[/TD]\n[TD]Yes[/TD]\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]4[/TD]\n[TD]GND[/TD]\n[TD]0[/TD]\n[TD].1[/TD]\n[TD]Yes[/TD]\n[TD]Yes[/TD]\n[TD]40k[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]5[/TD]\n[TD]Adapter Sense[/TD]\n[TD]0.3V[/TD]\n[TD]350k[/TD]\n[TD]Yes[/TD]\n[TD]No[/TD]\n[TD]40k[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\nI also measured Volts on <CHIP>U6900</CHIP> & <CHIP>U6901</CHIP> and got the following:\n<SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> - 0.5mV falls to 0.2mV\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK_VCC</SIGNAL> - 0.1mV\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> - 13mV falls slowly to 0.2mV\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 0.5mV falls slowly to 0.2mV\n\nThe logic board was dusty but after gentle cleaning (soft ESD brush, NOT toothbrush, + 99% Alcohol) I don't see any obvious signs of burning or corrosion. The DC IN board itself looks OK but the MagSafe connector looks rough - signs of cracking & exposed pin surface.\n\nI definitely plan to replace the DC IN board. Does anything in the above readings indicate need to replace <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> chip? (This would be my first microsolder attempt and would rather skip if it can be avoided.) Is there a way to test the charger? It's genuine and a bit dirty, but no frayed/exposed wires. The charging cable bends too easily just outside the rubber nipple at the brick.\n\nAs advised in the Rossmann Repair Training Guide, I did NOT use my genitals to check for thermal issues.\n\nThanks!"

The pins on the magsafe charger only output 0.03V on the Adapter Sense pin, 0V on the neighboring pins when tested to the outside (GND) pins. But just now I noticed EACH of the 5 Magsafe pins output 0.03V when measured against the Magsafe housing.\n\nI had yet to remove the left speaker. Yes, I get 0.3 Ohm at F6905 to ground when charger is plugged in. Here's something unexpected... I accidentally had the Magsafe plugged in, but the charger brick was not plugged in... I still read 0.3 Ohm. But when Magsafe is unplugged, I get 40k Ohm. Multimeter is set to resistance only, not diode mode. If I'm reading it correctly, I would need to set it to 2k Ohm for diode mode.\n\nYou mention TVS diode... <RESISTOR>R1980</RESISTOR> reads 3.5k Ohm at pin 1 to ground, 2.5k at pin 2 to ground, which confirms 1k per schematic."
