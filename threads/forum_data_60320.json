Magsafe green then orange. \nCleaned area with no change. Replaced u1900, u6101 and cleaned under u6100. All resistors around test good. \n\nMac came to me with a chinese charger so I switched attention to ISL. Replaced twice, no change. Just replaced SMC and again no change.  \n\nAnything else the charger could have killed? \n\n8.57 on PPBUSG_3H"}
