        "A2338": "What is A2338? A2338 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2020 M1, Mid 2022 M2 with EMC 8162, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-02020, 820-02773..",

        "LCDBKLT_SW": "What is LCDBKLT_SW? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
