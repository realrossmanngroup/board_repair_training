Determined it needed a new battery. Put one in, and the mag safe light goes off. I suspect it's blown the mag safe? I changed MagSafes, ran the board sans battery, works fine. Plugged in battery, plugged in MagSafe, light was green for a moment, then dead. (Board stayed lit up from battery power). No apparent previous liquid damage, but did have a prior charging issue.  Any ideas? I hate 3476 boards."}

It should reset if you unplug it from AC for a while.\nCheck Q7155 for short first."}

Problem is, board works 100% fine, runs on MagSafe or battery just fine, but it's not recognizing charging. I plug it in, boot it up, it shows a charging lightning bolt but when I click on the battery it says \"battery not charging\". Probes around isl6259, all resistors seem to be within spec. Any idea? I'd hate to scrap this just because of the battery not charging."}
