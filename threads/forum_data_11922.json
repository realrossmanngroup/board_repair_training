Plugged a battery in smelled something smoking, unplugged everything and ppbus_g3h is back to 1.5v. \n\nSomething seems to be shorting out the isl6259 when a battery is plugged in. i measured for short to ground on q7055, pin 5 gives me an 0L reading. checked for resistance on pin 5 with 0L still.\n\nnot really sure where to go with this one."}
