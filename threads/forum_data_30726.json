Any help appreciated!\n\n1. Board works fine, but fails four ASD tests for Airport: Test #1 (MAC address), Test #3 (Airport power cycle test), Test #8 (PCI ID Register Verification), and Test #9 (Wireless Module PCIe Root Port Hardware...).\n2. Tried new Airport card, no change.\n3. No liquid-damage or corrosion visible anywhere; history was that fan was running high (some sort of sensor issue), and I found the fan itself was bad\/faulty. Replaced it and all errors subsided except the Airport ones.\n4. Replaced U3540, U3560 and U3550. No change.\n5. WiFi and Bluetooth both work fine in OS, but these errors occur in ASD, so I don't want to \"just leave it\", as this is a retail customer who will re-run ASD when they receive it back. If they find an error, I can't really tell them to \"just leave it\", etc. :)\n\nAll help appreciated, as always! Thanks in advance."}

I was actually able to track the issue back to, believe it or not, a bad ASD install on one of our drives. No issues at all from it, but I just tried it on 3 Airs and they all \"fail\" the exact same tests. I'm not sure how it got damaged, but a clean install to the same drive did the trick. Weird; glad it's not a board issue after all! You can mark this one solved--thanks, Duke!"}
