            "message": "Got kind of a weird one, can't figure it out. Any help appreciated!\n\n1. Board works fine, but fails four ASD tests for Airport: Test #1 (MAC address), Test #3 (Airport power cycle test), Test #8 (PCI ID Register Verification), and Test #9 (Wireless Module PCIe Root Port Hardware...).\n2. Tried new Airport card, no change.\n3. No liquid-damage or corrosion visible anywhere; history was that fan was running high (some sort of sensor issue), and I found the fan itself was bad/faulty. Replaced it and all errors subsided except the Airport ones.\n4. Replaced <CHIP>U3540</CHIP>, <CHIP>U3560</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3550</CHIP>. No change.\n5. WiFi and Bluetooth both work fine in OS, but these errors occur in ASD, so I don't want to \"just leave it\", as this is a retail customer who will re-run ASD when they receive it back. If they find an error, I can't really tell them to \"just leave it\", etc. :)\n\nAll help appreciated, as always! Thanks in advance."

            "message": "Thanks, Duke! I was actually able to track the issue back to, believe it or not, a bad ASD install on one of our drives. No issues at all from it, but I just tried it on 3 Airs and they all \"fail\" the exact same tests. I'm not sure how it got damaged, but a clean install to the same drive did the trick. Weird; glad it's not a board issue after all! You can mark this one solved--thanks, Duke!"
