        "message":"Came in with lots and lots of damage near J8300 display connector.  Replaced, measured OK, many support components replaced as well.  Tested OK on bench, got picture and backlight, cleaned up and ultrasonic'd JUST THAT AREA.  99% alcohol bath in that place and oven.\n\nRetested after 100 C degrees oven for a couple hours, and now there's no picture.\n\nI've re-replaced the connector, just in case flux got cooked inside being careful to use only as much flux as i need.   No change.  I'm not 100% sure what to look for, all rails seem fine, but i've not dug super deep."
