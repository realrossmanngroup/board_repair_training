            "message": "Hi people,\n\nHere I have a strange case from this <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1990</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. It came from an other shop, and was initially took in charge for battery replacement because it was inflated.\n\nWhen I took it in charge, The Mac run fine on battery and also on charger when battery unplugged, but It has a charging issue. Three differents battery has been tried, and also battery cable. I can see charging spikes when the Mac is off and battery plugged. It goes to 0,8A for 2-3 secs, and goes to 0A, cycling. The battery pourcentage was shown in MacOS.\n\nThen I found light oxydation on one of the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>, I replaced it and some caps and R around. No change. With a thermal cam I saw <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> getting hot when charging spikes come, I replaced it. From this point, the battery pourcentage was not shown anymore on MacOS. The Mac can still run on battery and charger.\n\nThen I replaced <RESISTOR>R6910</RESISTOR> because of bad reading (15k instead of 4.7k), no change.\n\nI checked current sensors around <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, they were fine, I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7065</TRANSISTOR>, and also <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>.\n\nThis is the last thing I have done on this board, the behavior is still the same, I have a pretty bad understanding of what is going on and why the battery works, but cannot charge and being shown on MacOS.\n\nI really appreciate to have a little help on this one, thank you."

            "message": "Hi 2informaticos,\n\nThank you for your reply ! <RESISTOR>R6950</RESISTOR> was missing, probably knocked off as you mention it, and indeed <RESISTOR>R6910</RESISTOR> does not exist on schematics, but it does on the boardview, very strange. On the boardview it is the resistor next to <TRANSISTOR>Q6950</TRANSISTOR>, connected to his pin4. I can't find anything to match with on the schematics, and I am starting to ask my self, how the fuck did I changed this resistance if it is not shown on schematics...\n\nAt first I replaced it with a 4.7k first, don't know why I chose this value, it was in fact a 0omh. I replaced it and now it works fine.\n\nThank you for your expertise, first time I solved an issue through your forum ;)"
