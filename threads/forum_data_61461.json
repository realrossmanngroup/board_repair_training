            "message": "Hey guys! \n\nI have a Macbook Pro A1241 820 - 01700 that came in for repair due to boot loop\n\nIt gets to the apple logo with normal fan spin, hangs there for a few seconds, then the fans spin faster for a split 2 seconds or so that you can hear them - (customer said her mac was hissing and rebooting, which was just the fans) \n\nAfter the fan spin harder for 1 - 2 seconds, Mac turns off and starts again shortly after and loops this over and over. \n\nHaving a look over the board the only thing I can go off is that is was really dusty, to the point where I thought perhaps it's just been caught in a loop and running hot so it can't boot. \n\nAfter cleaning it up, and trying for a boot, no luck - no signs of any damaged bits or corrosion. \n\nWhat would you suggest? \n\nThanks, Max"
