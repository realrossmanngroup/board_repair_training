No signs of liquid damage.\n\nIt enters DFU mode but any T2 firmware restore attempt ends with error 9, even with connected good battery and Apple charger.\n\nNo shorts on the big coils or the small coils around U7800. I am missing the S5 power rails as well as PP1V2_S3. Also missing are some of the power-good input signals into U7800: PVCCIO_PGOOD, CPUVR_PGOOD, and PVDDQ_PGOOD. \n\nAnything else to check before I blame this on a faulty T2 chip?"}
