            "message": "Board originally had corrosion damage and not powering up. After cleaning, replaced <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>, <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>, <CAPACITOR>C5125</CAPACITOR>. Also repaired trace between <CAPACITOR>C1950</CAPACITOR>(1) and <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>(8). It worked for about a week and now not powering up again. When i place heat using a soldering iron directly on <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> for about a minute, i can then boot up the board. When allowed to cool, the board fan spins for about 5 seconds, shuts off and then starts spin. At this point, the usb port keeps repeating on and off (usb test led goes on and off). I've replaced <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> multiple times, along with <RESISTOR>R1962</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1950</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1963</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C1950</CAPACITOR>. Replaced the wire used to repair the trace between <CAPACITOR>C1950</CAPACITOR>(1) and <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>(8) previously as well, with the same result.\n\none other thing to note, when i try measuring the voltage on <RESISTOR>R1950</RESISTOR>(2), the board shuts off. <RESISTOR>R1950</RESISTOR>(1) is 3.3v and the board doesn't shutoff when i take measurement from that point \n\nAny suggestion"
