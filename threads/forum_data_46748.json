        "820-3435": "What is 820-3435? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

            "message": "I have a major major PITA one that I need help with. For sure, sees and runs off of a known good battery. Came in with \"possible previous liquid damage\" but it looks like a refurb board to me (edge bonding on CPU was heated and on some other chips as well). Originally, <RESISTOR>R7180</RESISTOR> was knocked loose from the board so I thought hmm easy one. Put a new one on got a light then no light after a half second. Ok thought shorted <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>. Replaced it and the ISL and got fan spin! However, it only did once then stopped. PPBUS went from 8.58 to 1.6 volts pretty much after that. Since then, I have been chasing a rabbit to figure out why it won't charge. PPBUS is not shorted to ground. Pins 17/18 and 27/28 of the ISL check out great. All of the traces and probe points have continuity from the ISL to the next component in line. I have so far replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> (twice), the ISL several times, <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> at the same time as the ISL, two resistors I knocked free, and since that, not much more. CHGR ACIN and DCIN are both present. <SIGNAL>PP5V1_CHGR</SIGNAL> is present. <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is present, <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is present, the SMBUS lines are both 3.4 no issues there. CHGR A GATE and B GATE both appear to be zero. I get 16 volts on pin 1 of <CAPACITOR>C7185</CAPACITOR> but 6.8 on pin 2. 0.004 volts on pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R7186</RESISTOR>. I've tried 5 ISL's from different batches and donor boards. Any ideas??? This one is a nightmare."
