        "message":"Hi.\nMacbook came in originally with no backlight.\nConfirmed display worked - with torch from behind could see login screen.\nReplaced backlight, which blew again.\nTried with known good display assembly after replacing fuse - unit worked.\nReturned to customer.\n\nNow, customer returned it with the same issue.\nThe fan goes to maximum and stays there after a few seconds.\n\nReplaced backlight fuse - still no backlight.\nTried with another known working display assembly - same.\n\nChecked voltage at PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT: ONLY 12.46v\nWhich makes me suspect U9701.\n\nChecked inputs to U9701:\n\nPP5V_S0_BLK: 5v\nPPBUS_SW_BKL:12.6v\nPP3V3_S0_BKL_VDDIO:3.3v\nLCD_BKLT_PWM:2.63v (measured at pin2-r9704).\n\nThis last one is suspicious:\nPPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR:12.6v (measured at pin1-R9731)\nBUT pin2-R9731 measures 0.05v!\n\nThe resistance across R9731 reads 280K ohm.\nHowever across R9715 showed only around 100 ohm, not the 100K it should.\nI desoldered R9715, and measured the two points under it and I get the same 100 ohm.\nPin2 on R9715 shows 100 ohms to ground.\n\nGiven there is only 0.05v going to BKL_EN (A3 on U9701) measured from pin2 on either R9731 or R9715, does this mean that U9701 is internally shorted?\n\nBy the way, SMC_LID is 3.42v.\n\nI do not have any spare U9701, so I removed one from another unknown faulty same logic board.\nAfterwards, all the voltages are the same, and the same symptoms, although I cannot rule out that the board I took it from had the same issue.\n\nAny suggestions on what I may have missed, or what to test next.\nAny help greatly appreciated."
