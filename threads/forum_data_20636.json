            "message": "I have a 829-3476 that came in mostly dead. Charger light would turn green then orange, but would never turn on. Checked voltages and found all of them present except for <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL>.\n\nExamined board and found a tiny bit or corrosion around <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> and <CHIP>U8330</CHIP>. Cleaned it off then ultrasonic bath. <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL> is back and the macbook is able to turn on.\n\nIt will turn on, chime, and boot with no problem. It's not until you try to login does it give issues... Here are a few situations that I noticed:\n\nIf I try to boot with everything connected (touchpad included) it will get to the user selection screen. When you select a user, it will lock up, beachball, sometimes flash graphics glitches (checkboard pattern). Sometimes it will take you back to the user login screen, and sometimes it will just lock up hard.\n\nIf I try to login while it's in cripple mode (touchpad unplugged) it will actually work. It runs slow as hell, but I can login, get on Safari and play a youtube video.\n\nIf I plug everything back in, including TP, and boot into safe mode, it works great. No slowness, or locking up. I get the occasional screen flash when scrolling web pages, but that may just be because I am in safe mode...\n\nIt passes EFI ASD with no errors, with everything plugged in.\n\nIt won't load the OS ASD with the TP plugged in. It tries to load, says \"finding available tests\" eventually lock up and turn black, and then go back to \"finding available tests\"\n\nI have already replaced the whole top case also."
