            "message": "Hi everyone.\n\nThis MacBook had liquid damage about 10 months ago.\nI've replaced a few components and done U.S cleaning and it is back to life.\n\nSo, now it is back to me with no power: TrackPad clicking and a loud fan.\nAfter opening, I found a blown UC710 (SN621371) that I only found the equivalent  TPS621351RGXR . It seems to be OK, but still waiting for a few more components to test the mac. And a nice hole on the board. I had to dig in and use a UV mask to isolate after removing the fused shorted layers.\n\nProblem is that one short line remained <SIGNAL>PP3V3_V2</SIGNAL>. Leading me to the sense resistor RD810 next to the WIFI/BT module.\nUnfortunately, I remove this sense resistor and the short on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_V2</SIGNAL> is gone.\nThe short now is present on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_WLBT_ISNS</SIGNAL>.\n\nDoes anyone know if is possible to replace the WIFI/BT module on this model?\n\nThanks, everyone."
