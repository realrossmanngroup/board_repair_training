It drew about 2,5 amps at ~4 volts and didnt switch to 20V.\nPPBUS_G3H and PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS_F were shorted to GND\n\nQ3100 had an internal short, bridging PPDCIN and PP20VB. replaced it.\nQ3200 replaced just in case. pads for both of these looked bad. Pitted, dull grey. Probably from heating up a lot?\n\nU3100 replaced from identical donor board - no damage found underneath, but did find some weird glue-looking stuff. reflowed U3200.\n\nShort is gone, machine now sits at 5.18V with 20 mAmp.

Is there anything else I can check to verify if U3100\/U3200 are working properly?  Anything else to measure with these symptoms?\n\nU3100:\n[ATTACH]54996._xfImport[\/ATTACH][ATTACH]54997._xfImport[\/ATTACH][ATTACH]54998._xfImport[\/ATTACH]"}
