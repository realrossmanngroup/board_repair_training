        "A2338": "What is A2338? A2338 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2020 M1, Mid 2022 M2 with EMC 8162, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-02020, 820-02773..",
        "820-02020": "What is 820-02020? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
