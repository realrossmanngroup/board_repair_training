        "message":"820-00164 GREEN LIGHT NO FAN - I removed the board from the case and noticed water stains under the fan. When plugged in I could feel heat coming from the area to the right of the fan. C7323. Confirmed the short with a little alcohol. After removing C7323 I get fan spin. I do not have another donor board with the exact chip NEd AV7. Would the computer work fine without? Or will I need to track one down? I cant seem to find one of these online."
