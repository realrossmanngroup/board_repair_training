When plugged in I could feel heat coming from the area to the right of the fan. <CAPACITOR>C7323</CAPACITOR>. Confirmed the short with a little alcohol. After removing <CAPACITOR>C7323</CAPACITOR> I get fan spin. I do not have another donor board with the exact chip NEd AV7. Would the computer work fine without? Or will I need to track one down? I cant seem to find one of these online."
