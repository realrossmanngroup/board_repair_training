        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",

            "message": "Plug in the 60W OEM magsafe, you usually get a green light w/fan spin, no chime/display/anything. Fan continually runs higher and higher etc, the usual. No USB activity/no beeps when ram is not inserted.\nOccasionally, when optical drive is connected, you'll get the whir of the optical drive starting, but still no display/chime/etc.\n\nNow I did replace <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> and reflow'd SMC to rule out easy fixes, did some inspecting around the board to see if anything was amiss--found <CAPACITOR>C3887</CAPACITOR> and <RESISTOR>R1810</RESISTOR> poppin off the board, due to corrosion. Didn't bother with <CAPACITOR>C3887</CAPACITOR> as it was TBLT, but <RESISTOR>R1810</RESISTOR> seems to me the likely culprit as to why this board isn't fully booting. Unfortunately, pad 1 was already gone, and while attempting to solder a nice lil jumper wire to it, pad 2 decided to pop off as well. So, now I have no pads for <RESISTOR>R1810</RESISTOR> and unfortunately the closest trace points are nearly half a board away. Before I go crazy over this, is this likely the reason why the board isn't booting? Not sure if this data line is critical for board POST.\n\nedit - if not obvious <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> and VCORE have proper voltages, 3.4v/1.2v. As a side note, 3v42 is 3.5v and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.62v. Bit higher than usual?"
