SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",

SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",

(no bat connected)\nNot powering from battery, no X, ASD does not test battery.\nGreen / Orange on MagSafe is there\n\n[B]Checked:[/B]\nRemoved the wire on <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL</SIGNAL> to SMC to double check. Voltage still 1V13. Will stick the wire back on the trace.\n<RESISTOR>R5381</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R5380</RESISTOR> measure fine = 1.973K & 1.933K\n\nSo if it's not the SMC and it's not the battery and it's not the pullups then it must be <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> right?.... Or am I missing something?\nAnything I should be looking for here that I'm not looking for now?"
