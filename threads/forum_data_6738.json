(no bat connected)\nNot powering from battery, no X, ASD does not test battery.\nGreen \/ Orange on MagSafe is there\n\n[B]Checked:[\/B]\nRemoved the wire on SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL to SMC to double check. Voltage still 1V13. Will stick the wire back on the trace.\nR5381 & R5380 measure fine = 1.973K & 1.933K\n\nSo if it's not the SMC and it's not the battery and it's not the pullups then it must be ISL6259 right?.... Or am I missing something?\nAnything I should be looking for here that I'm not looking for now?"}
