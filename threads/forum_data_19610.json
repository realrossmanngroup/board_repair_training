The water indicator is red but the board has no corrosion and very little signs of liquid present.\n\nCleaned what little liquid residue I could fine. Put it together it works but battery is shot.\n\nReplace battery and computer starts turning itself off on boot. As soon as logo comes up 2 seconds later it shuts off. Disconnect track pad and the computer stays on. So track pad must be faulty?\n\nReplace track pad and cable and it does the same thing. \n\nWhat am I missing? Is track pad connected causing something odd with the keyboard? I looked at the connectors and the board and can see no indication of what may be messed up."

Ive ordered it but the thing that I don't understand and maybe you can explain it Duke.\n\nIf the keyboard is bad why does the PC boot and not turn itself off when the keyboard only is plugged in and the power button functions normally.\n\nI noticed while probing the <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> rail with just the keyboard or just the track pad the line stays high 3.3v but if I connect the track pad and keyboard the line goes low .667v. My logic on it is if the <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> comes from the power button shouldnt it do that with just the keyboard plugged in also?"
