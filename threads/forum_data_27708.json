Ran a jumper to it.  still no fan spin. Started through the rails. pp5v_s5 seems to be pulsing betwixt 5 and 3 volts... not normal is it?"}

G2_EN is probably pulsing, is S5_PWRGD pulsing too?[\/QUOTE]\n\nIt's hard to say liquid damage. But I did mean corrosion on those two when I said \"blow\". It would be weird because there is no other evidence of liquid infiltration. Just those two little r's. Nonetheless S5_PWRGD  and G2_EN are both pulsing all over the place."}
