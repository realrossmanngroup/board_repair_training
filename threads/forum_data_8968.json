A month after i bought it, i turned it on and the question mark folder appeared. I turned it off and left it around 2 hours and tried again and worked normally. And it did that to me like once every 2 months. After reading on different blogs i came out to the conclusion that the 1TB SSD was damaged, but i bought an external case for the 1TB SSD and connect it via USB to another computer and [B]it worked[\/B] just fine\".\n\nI plugged in a 512GB SSD that I have laying around and it booted perfectly fine which makes me think the SSD is in fact the issue. Is there any way I would be able to repair this SSD? \n\nAlso, I don't see any liquid damage on the SSD but I do see some burned pads on J1800 which is right above the SSD."}
