You should have 0v there. So, now I imagine what could be happening is that SMC_PM_G2_EN is present but U7501 is shorted to ground and pulling it down, and is also pulling down PP3V3_S5 along with it. I also find it odd that with a dead SMC you are getting 8.58v on PPBUS_G3H instead of the typical 8.15v I would expect with a dead SMC. But still, partially dead SMC is totally possible.\n\nIt's either the SMC or U7501 from the data you've provided."
