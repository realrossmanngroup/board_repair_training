You should have 0v there. So, now I imagine what could be happening is that <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> is present but <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> is shorted to ground and pulling it down, and is also pulling down <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> along with it. I also find it odd that with a dead SMC you are getting 8.58v on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> instead of the typical 8.15v I would expect with a dead SMC. But still, partially dead SMC is totally possible.\n\nIt's either the SMC or <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> from the data you've provided."
