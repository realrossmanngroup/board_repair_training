            "message": "So I don't usually work on Macbooks, 95 percent of my business is cell phones, but I do the occasional macbook pro display replacement. I was working on my customers <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> MacBook Pro 2016 Display Replacement, and now I can't get the device to boot up after putting on the new screen. I'm pretty novice when it comes to diagnosing problems on the macbooks. I did watch some of Rossmanns videos, and checked the voltage with the battery unplugged and got 20 volts. I put on the old screen and still nothing. Can you all help me out here?"
