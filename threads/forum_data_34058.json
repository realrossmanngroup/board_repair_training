Thanks again.\n\n[URL]https://photos.app.goo.gl/dqy0w9mRPnRYizl82[/URL]\n\nSince camera error is included, I disconnected it and no more high fan spin. Gonna run ASD again without it.\n\nUpdate - With camera disconnected, no errors thrown. Bad connector ?\n\nUpdate - Connector looks clean. SMC did get hit with some liquid.\n\nUpdate - Reflowed SMC, fans still roaring."
