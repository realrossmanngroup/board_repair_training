Without it draws around 0.8A 20V, with battery its up to 50W\nNo display output on internal, if i disconnect internal and test external i dont get video either. (verified external of course)\n\nInspected board on both sides, nothing is critically damaged, only a few oxidized caps etc.\n\nFans spin, cpu gets hot\n\nBoard has been handled by an unknown tech before be, antenna-cable metal loop for screw was under the board and a clasp is missing\n\nDont have too much experience diagnosing no video.\n\nThanks :)"}
