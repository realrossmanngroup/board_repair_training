        "message":"This is the first M1 board I have worked on, so still learning the new nomenclature. Its USB-C is at 20V, drawing 0.02A. I found a short to ground on PP3V3_S2, which I traced to its power chip UC710 and open current sense resistor RD560. I replaced UC710 and RD560, which removed the short. Now I have:\n\nPPBUS_AON: 12.0V\nPP3V3_AON: 3.3V\nPP1V8_AON: 1.8V\nPP3V8_AON: 3.8V\nPP3V3_S2: 2.8V\nP3V3S2_EN: 1.8V"
