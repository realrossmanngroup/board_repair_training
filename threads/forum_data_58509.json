Sometimes grey screen one second or two when booting, sometimes no. Sometimes it lights on a second time for one second, sometimes no.\n- no video\n- current around 1.5A at the beginning, then slowly growing, and after 2 minutes can reach 3A, then I stop. Fans are not increasing strangely. Board is quite hot.\nIf I remove the trackpad connector fans are running full speed, it gets hot but this time cut itself automatically around 2.5A after 5 minutes\n\nI measured all the rails, all the voltages are ok, I cannot detect any lower voltage due to a partial short for example.\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU: 1.14V before boot, 0.99V after\n\nAny idea where to start? Can it be the CPU or MCP overheating? How to detect\/confirm that?"}

I tested this pendrive on a working board, indeed the LED blinks just after the boot. I tested it on a board with bad BIOS chip, it stayed always off.\nQuestion: how can you diagnose a bad CPU, MCP or GPU, from a bad BIOS chip\/BIOS software?"}
