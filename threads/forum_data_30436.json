            "message": "Ok so this 2012 definitely had liquid the board was very clean when I got it but the underside of the lid was HORRENDOUS lmfao. Anyways, the sensor that failed was the fin stack sensor, so I replaced <CHIP>U5511</CHIP> and checked the caps and resistors on the circuit for shorts or damage and they all check out. I ran ASD again and was STILL getting crazy high fan speed, so I replaced <RESISTOR>R5260</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5261</RESISTOR> because they were reading 1/4 of their values. Still had high fan speed, so I removed the edge bonding from the SMC and reflowed it. Now the fan speed is completely gone BUT the board still fails the Fin Stack sensor test. The machine boots normally and runs off a battery, and even on a slow old, spindle drive it runs pretty well. I'm going to test it with a known good drive tomorrow just to make sure it is running full speed like it should, but my question is should I keep looking at the sensor failure even if the machine is running properly?"
