        "820-2915": "What is 820-2915? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",

No liquid damage, supposedly just stopped working.\n\nWhat' I've measured:\n\nFuse: 12.6v on each side\n<SIGNAL>BKLT_EN</SIGNAL>: 3.2v\nLVDS Pins 389,39,40; all at 29.6v\n\nFigured it was a bad LCD right? Nope, tested an LCD that works fine and no backlight still.\n\nThe current sink resistors all measure 0 ohms, getting between 3.2 and 3.5v on them. I figure the LED Driver is boosting fine since I'm getting 29v at the LCD connector.\n\nBad LVDS connector maybe?"

It's up to you at this point. If you feel your skills are up to it you can replace it, but if they aren't you killed a board that came to you with no backlight. Selling [I]that [/I]to the customer is far more difficult than \"we can only give you max brightness all the time.\"\n\nThe best would be if something but <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> is causing the light to always be low, you replace it and it still doesn't work.. that would suck. :)"
