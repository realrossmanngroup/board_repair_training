I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q5158</TRANSISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R5625</RESISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C5625</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C5595</CAPACITOR> and there was a burned trace under pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R5100</RESISTOR> which i wired to pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R5193</RESISTOR>. After this the fan spins up, stops, then turns on again and keeps running. The machine doesnt boot though, display stays black, no backlight. I have CPU Vcore and clock cycle. Any ideas?"
