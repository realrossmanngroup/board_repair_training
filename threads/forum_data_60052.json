I’m not sure this is correct but on pin 458 of <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> I have a dead 0.00v short I removed (<RESISTOR>R2465</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R2460</RESISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C2465</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C2466</CAPACITOR>,<CAPACITOR>C7781</CAPACITOR>,<CHIP>U7800</CHIP>) on this line and on <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> Pin 1 (<SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0_PCH_VCCADPLL</SIGNAL>)\nI still have a dead short.

I also have a Quick 861On my desk. I see you’ve already answered my question About buying a new PCH above so I’ll buy it new :) Let’s see how this goes wish me luck that I’ll pull out a miracle"
