        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS": "What is PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS? This power rail is PPBUS_G3H after going through a current sense resistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H & the input of PPBUS_G3H to circuitry that provides power for the CPU..",
