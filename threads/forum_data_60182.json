            "message": "Originally came in with low <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> I replaced <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and sent it back. Two months later it has returned with the same problem so I replaced <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> again but this time after the replacement the fan would spin for 1 second than shut off. It would start with SMC bypass so I checked all sensors and eventually replaced SMC with no luck. When testing further I have found if you hold the power button for 5 seconds when it has finished chiming it will boot but is running extremely slow. If you release the power button before it has finished chiming it will shut down.\n\nI have just put another bios with clean ME and tried another SSD but it is still the same. Do you think I am dealing with two issues here?"
