I received a MacBook 14\" <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2442</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> at the shop this week that is not able to stay on, when you press the power button you can see the screen for 2 seconds, no trackpad neither keyboard activity, and screen goes black again. When the hinge sensor is unplugged, it works fine. After further inspection, the board is clean but the hinge sensor had liquid damage. \n\nI have seen that contrary to the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2141</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> 2019 16\" you can't replaced the hinge sensor with a brand new one on Aliexpress because of a program. WTF, was it really needed ?\n\nMy question is pretty obvious I guess but I'd like your feedback, and maybe a solution if someone have one. Is it this chip that contain the \"program\" (photo attached) ? I was able to save the pads on the pcb, but 2 on the chip are definitly gone :'(\n\nThank you for your time"
