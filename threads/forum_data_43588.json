        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

After ultrasonic turn on but no backlight.\nBacklight out was 8.5 v so\nChanged bklight driver and got the back light back but after few minutes again bklighet gone. changed bklight driver again\n\nnow bklight out is 20.9v. Bkl-EN=2.8v, bkl-pwm=1.46!!!!\n\nbut no backlight. I did all reset and this is good know screen. what next, any help please?"
