When I tried a known good video card it showed image and booted to the login screen, but I turned it off. The next time I turned it on, it didn\u00b4t show image. What should I check first?"}

Please help me figure this out... I have 3 imacs experiencing the same fault... When it turned on, we used it and when we were watching videos on youtube, the image went off, but we could still hear the audio... thats why I know the computer works..."}
