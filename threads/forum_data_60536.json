        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

        "PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC": "What is PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC? PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad..",
