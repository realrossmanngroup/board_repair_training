It runs slowly - freezing, beachball appearing just generally a very laggy experience.\n\nNow given I do not presently have another SSD which is working and compatible with this system I cannot currently try that - I have ordered one to see if this is a simple case of a dodgy SSD which i'm thinking is probably the most likely issue but I would like to ask everyone here if there's anything on the board I might want to check which would cause only the internal SSD to run badly but wouldn't affect the external drive?"}
