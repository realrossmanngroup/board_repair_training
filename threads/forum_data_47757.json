            "message": "Working on a board that had liquid to some areas I'm not thrilled about, but it is what it is!\n\nObvious liquid to <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7900</CHIP>, <CHIP>U4200</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> (awesome, great, very excited). Board running on 5.14v that cycles every ~8 seconds or so, EXCEPT if I connect charger to the bottom right-side port, in which case it does NOT loop, but does stay at 5.14v with 0 amperage draw. I replaced <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>/<TRANSISTOR>Q3100</TRANSISTOR> because it had direct, obvious liquid and some resistors were burned, hoping it was the cause of my looping. Nope, ports still loop except for bottom-right port.\n\n[U]I am providing measurements with charger connected to bottom-right USB-C port, as that's the only one that does not loop:[/U]\n\n1. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, 0v.\n2. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>, 3.41v (no short, .333 diode)\n3. <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 5.2v at <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> (no short--.517 diode)\n4. Diode on all 4 <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> power fuses is .120\n5. <SIGNAL>TBA_VDDA</SIGNAL> is 5.1v.\n\nNow it would seem the most immediate issue is <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> being only 5.2v, which I believe is due to SMC not communicating with charger. Is this correct?\n\nAlso, since I've never seen anything like it and I'm curious--what is primary function of <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>? It almost looks like a 2nd SMC, and I'm not familiar with it. Since it take some liquid and had some visible (but minor) corrosion, I considered replacing it, but since it's a larger BGA, I figured I'd wait until I got a bit more direction. I did reflow it with no change, however.  :)\n\nAny help appreciated!"

Once I replaced it with a C00 chip, the board began working--no more cycling, etc. It boots and has passed AHT, and seems to be working well! :)\n\nThanks again!"
