Some people think, that it’s possible to read T2 ROM chip and remove EFI password like on machines without T2. Some think, that’s it’s impossible. So how it is? I was successful to read T2 ROM chip, but there is nothing similar to previos generation boards EFI. What is your experience in this field? All these unlocking programmers are just scam?"

From one side it’s pity, that Apple has moved BIOS into T2, but from another side - previous “security” of EFI was funny… any person with cheapest programmer could remove password."
