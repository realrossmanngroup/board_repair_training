Some people think, that it\u2019s possible to read T2 ROM chip and remove EFI password like on machines without T2. Some think, that\u2019s it\u2019s impossible. So how it is? I was successful to read T2 ROM chip, but there is nothing similar to previos generation boards EFI. What is your experience in this field? All these unlocking programmers are just scam?"
