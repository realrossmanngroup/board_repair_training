        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "EDP_BKLT_PWM": "What is EDP_BKLT_PWM? EDP_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "I2C_BKLT_SCL": "What is I2C_BKLT_SCL? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. ."

            "message": "Hi guys, this one has got me going crazy..... So i have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with no backlight, usually my favourite repairs. Sometimes it works for a day and then its off again. Board looks superclean. Changed the display cable as these are not good in many cases, same issue. Changed the display for a know working one, same issue. 38-49v on the connector, so it has voltage. So I assumed it was inside the connector, which i eplaced, still the same issue. Is there any othe voltage/dataline i need to get backlight besides PPVOUT?"

When i turn it on display shows. I close the lid, open it again and the backlight is off. With a flashlight I can see the login screen. When i press the backlight adjustment keys the screen actually seems to blink. Will check these 2 lines now, what diode mode reading should these have?"
