        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

            "message": "So this project has been a little disasterous for me so far.. Was a routine Macbook Air LCD-only replacement (done plenty before) but after installation of a new LCD the backlight appeared to be out (could see apple logo on the LCD). I replaced the backlight strip because i had some scratches on the cable thinking that may be the issue but still same problem. I then decided to order a new lcd panel only to find that to not work either. At this point I knew it was probably board-level. After testing around I found 8.1v on pin 3 (gate) of the transistor and 8.4v on pin 4 (source) of the transistor (<TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR>), but nothing going through. nothing on the board looks damaged and it had backlight before with the customer's bad LCD. Is the voltage on the gate low enough?"

My main question was more specifically how much lower it had to be in order to open. Wasn't sure if it was as low as 1v or as high as 6v"

Diode mode reading is 0.551.... from my experience this could be <SIGNAL>SW_0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SW_1</SIGNAL> ??"
