Got this board with a strange behavior. CPU clock is stuck at 0.8GHZ according to Intel Power Gadget and the machine is running terribly slow. This board has classic issue on R5301\/02 area and on the under side too. Verified all resistors and traces and all good. Mouse moves normally without lag. CPU gets clock requisition for 3.2GHZ but does not scale up. Any ideas on what to do?"}
