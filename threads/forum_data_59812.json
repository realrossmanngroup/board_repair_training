I know that if someone has been messing with bios and SN this will heaped I didn't touch it but it look like someone try fix something so its possible bios has been reflashed with unknown EFI and SN. Is it possible to fix this issue without knowing what serial number was before or other ways to repair it ? \nOr should I just build a new bios with clean ME and put serial number with is showing now in device info?\nI have lid but it doesn't belongs this machine its  from another Mac and manufacture year is 2012 according to serial with is on it.. \nI've checked board but those models doesn't have any stickers on MB itself with serial just to see if matching. \n\nThanks in advice."}
