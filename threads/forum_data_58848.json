        "message":"Ok, I wanted to make sure my DVOM was accurate, so I borrowed a friends newer DVOM and went through all the rails again to verify. And there were some different readings. So the PPVCORE_GPU is still reading 0v however my diode test is .008v and ohms are 5 ohms instead of .5 ohms. Bad meter and or leads I'm guessing.\n\nSo all my rails are ok except the following below:\n\nPPBUS_SW_BKL 0v (12.6v spec)\nPP15V_TBT 0v (15v)\nPP3V3_S0GPU .5v (3.3v) no short to ground\nPP3V3_S0GPU_MISC .5v (3.3v) no short to ground\nPP1V5R1V35_S0GPU 0v (1.5v) 1.2 ohms to ground .003v diode mode\nPP1V0_S0GPU_ISNS ov (1.05v) 189 ohms to ground .106v diode mode\n\nThis unit will do a SMC reset and a PRAM reset like normal. \n\nUsing a flashlight I cannot see anything on the screen either. I'm not sure if the screen actually works. I picked it up at an auction so no history either.\n\nThanks"

Did not get very far since the first in the sequence:\n\nEG_RAIL1_EN = 0V (3.3v spec) .640v diode and 17.6 K ohms to ground so no short.\n\nIt looks like to me this 1st voltage comes out of the U9600? I checked all the voltage inputs to the U9600 and all are there.\n\nCould that U9600 be the cause? Does this chip have firmware? If yes, do you know by chance what other boards I can rob from?\n\nOne of the things I cannot figure out with the U9600 is what line(s) turn that chip on?

Everything else on the board seems to work, so I'm contemplating installing those caps or just sending it back for a refund.\n\nThanks"
