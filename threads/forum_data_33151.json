        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the backlight on the LCD screen, this is necessary to get the screen to light up..",
        "LCDBKLT_BOOST": "What is LCDBKLT_BOOST? LCDBKLT_BOOST is connected to the SWITCH(SW) pin of the LED driver and is switched to ground quickly after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit that boosts PPBUS_G3H to backlight voltage for the screen. .",
        "LP8550": "What is LP8550? This is an LED driver responsible for creating the backlight on the LCD screen of Macbooks from 2011 through 2015.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

Replaced led driver im assuming if i had bridged any balls on led driver the system wouldnt turn on? I do get an image on screen and <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is high my only guess to why i dont get a backlight at this point is that <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> is not getting proper voltage?\n\n<SIGNAL>PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> = 8.56v\npin 3/4 of lcd connector get 8.56v\n<SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_BOOST</SIGNAL> = 8.56v\n<SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> = 2.8v\n\nany ideas?"

Ill have to run a wire from test point of FB to A5 ball. PWM signal is present but at 1.4v\n\nill have to wait for my LED drivers to come in before i continue.\n\nis it smart to try and dig out a pad on A5 or is it useless once it comes off?"

I get 8.5v on that wire now but i still get no backlight is it because <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> remains at 1.4v and <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> is at 2.8v? Im stumped at this point.\n\nUpdate: found the issue i ran a wire to the wrong point removed and all is working. I do however get this theater light effect on the bottom right side of the screen also when turning the brightness down the left side gets darker than the right Its not a big deal but im wondering if its the screen itself from the water damage or the isens resistors at fault?"
