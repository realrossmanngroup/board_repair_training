        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",

        "EDP_BKLT_PWM": "What is EDP_BKLT_PWM? EDP_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

They tried \"resetting\" without success (not sure what they did).\nNo liquid damage. No prior repair apparent except local AASP diagnosed \"bad board.\" They removed the board at some time (missing screws).\nThey may have caused something in the process, since I found couple of resistors with pry damage near SMC (may have caused them myself tbh).\n\nUsing 85W original charger and 2 previously tested panels, noticed it was \"no backlight.\"\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> is 48.9V @ connector.\n<SIGNAL>LCD_HPD_CONN</SIGNAL> is 2.5V @ connector.\n<SIGNAL>PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD</SIGNAL> is 5.1V @ connector.\n<SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL> is 0.225V @ connector => 1.8M Ohm resistance to GND =><SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 3.39V on <RESISTOR>R5171</RESISTOR> near SMC and <SIGNAL>EDP_BKTL_EN</SIGNAL> is 3.335V @ <RESISTOR>R1430</RESISTOR>. \n\nIs there a feedback for this circuit that I need to worry about? \nWhat could be causing PWM to be so low?\nCan I inject PWM to connector or may harm CPU?\nAny suggestion as what to do next is welcome.

            "message": "Ok something weird here.\nI conclude the following: the Mac was for some reason \"dead.\" As in if you drain the battery or reset it probably, it should restart.\nThey took it to a local AASP and the tech there knocked off some SMC resistors and pronounced it dead.\nIt came to me, I noticed and re-soldered the resistor, and it booted without B/L on my new screen.\n1/ Tested with the original screen, it works normally.\n2/ Tested with my new screen again while fully reassembled except SSD, it works if we close then re-open lid. Restart, no B/L. Close/re-open lid => B/L.\n3/ Added SSD, now it boots normally and B/L works normally.\n3/ Tested the same with 2 other original cracked screens that we had laying around. Same as step 2 and 3. They work normally only when fully reassembled and SSD is installed.\nAm I missing something stupid? \nSo now it is working properly with all the screens, but I can't figure out the B/L not working unless reassembled with SSD (except for the one that came with it)???"
