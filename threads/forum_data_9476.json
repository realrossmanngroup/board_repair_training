I tried now and 5 times will not power and 1 time will power.\nWith original 60W adapter when I plug it I can observe 2 thing.\n1. If green light is on constantly it will power and will have video\n2. If green light is on but blinking, it will not power. It is blinking 90% on and 10% off, but easy to realize it is blinking. \n\nHope with this you can tell me something more."
