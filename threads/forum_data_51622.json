ASD EFI passes but ASD OS has 2 thermal errors \"unknown result code -- test failed\" and the fans are constantly running full speed.\n\nThis macbook had liquid damage, I replaced a couple of resistors near the SMC <RESISTOR>R5092</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R2502</RESISTOR> and ran a jumper from pin2 of <RESISTOR>R5092</RESISTOR> to <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> as that pad was gone. The only other corrosion I could find was a little inside the thunderbolt connectors.\n\nI tried another heatsink and thermal paste and checked that <CHIP>U5570</CHIP> has 3.3V on pin1. Could this be a problem with the SMC?"
