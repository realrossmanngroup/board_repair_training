I already purchased a set of standard caps off local ebay ( allegro ) in Poland ( where I am from ).\nBut I need to get my hands on 0402 63.4K resistor. I can't find it anywhere in local retail and I am considering ordering from China. The shipping is about 1 - 2 mths so therefor I have some questions:\n\n- can I order a set ( book ) so that I don't have to wait another time one I find another part that needs to be replaced\nproblem with that approach is the values of resistors in the book doesn't really match exactly the value I need, for example I need mentioned above 63.4K and they have 62K in the list of book components. They do have single value offers with exact resistance but then I need to still figure out a list of which it would be smart to order since the delivery time etc. They are of course dirt cheap but the delivery time makes for the whole discussion.\n\n- I know in the youtube vids Louis always grabs parts from donor boards and that it is preferred solution in this forum - I don't have that option. I don't run a shop, I am a noob and I just want to fix my board if I can.\n\n- both above lead to my other question: how strict does the value of resistor have to be ? I did some calculation and it seemed to me that there is no difference between 63.4K and 61.9K res on 12V over 1\/16W for example, therefore is it possible to consider different parts for the job ? I know it depends so I will bring specific example of R8402 in my board, which is the res in question. \n\n- how do I approach a list of components to order ahead ? My board is without that resistor currently. \n\n\nBackstory to whole repair:\nMac had a spill. Local certified service wanted more money for repair than it costed new. Local non certified service still wanted a lot of money ( enough to buy parts, tools etc and still have fun repairing it and learning something ).\n\nScreen is black, keyboard doesn't show caps-lock light but it seems to be responding to SMC reset.\nFan is spinning.\n\nBoard outside of case and disconnected battery, screen etc. takes 20v, at first seconds ~550mA then ~300 mA\n\nDamaged area is around Q8400, the C8401 was missing  ( looked like it was there before looking at solder and slots ) so I added it. I blew away the R8402 with hot air and it's MIA.\n\nThere is 12v at C8401 2nd pin ( LCDBKLT_EN_L ). There is proper resistance on Q8400 between 3 & 4 pins.\n\n\n--- As mentioned above I am a noob. My knowledge of the subject comes form your youtube channel. If you have any tips on what is smart to do \/ diagnose at this stage pls let me know and I can measure things.\n\nThanks for everything."}
