(fly piss on a cap - cap tested fine, cleaned well)\n\nThere is no chime or beeps, but most all S0 power lines come on. ALL_SYS_PWR_GOOD is high,fan spins, green light, then amber.\n\nThe only voltage i notice missing is PPVCORE_S0_AXG_R. There is no voltage on pin 13 U7400.\n\nWhere would you go next?"

So progress!\n\nLooking a little better at the housing, it had some pretty decent drop damage a few times - so i thought i would reflow the ram to see if there was any luck.\n\nBumping each one, i messed something up and caused no boot at all. Decided, why not try reballing all the ram, see how bad it truly is.\n\n1248 balls later, everything is back on and the system is working great! No asd errors - besides low capacity battery.\n\nSo, this one is solved! Thanks for the help. Happy fixing"
