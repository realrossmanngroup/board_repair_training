            "message": "Hi Guys, good evening. I got from a customer a <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1989</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> EMC 3214, board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A  and it suffered medium liquid damage, in my opinion. I replaced some caps and res, some other ones I just reflux and it's turning on now. The problem is it doesn't load the OSX until the end, even from Internal or External drives. \n\nThe major problem I have now is, the [B]<RESISTOR>R4802</RESISTOR> [/B]lost its point 2, and looks like it's a point that sends energy to a lot of other points over the board. There's a whole in its place and I don't know how to solve this.\n\nI run Apple diagnosis and no-fault was mentioned. The battery is still working good.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks, Eduardo"

It won't be a problem if, when I chose my wifi network, and goes to the password screen to enter it, the mouse starts stepping and it never finishes the connection and do not proceed... \n\nI tried to start from Catalina and BigSur drives I have here. \n\nBTW, I don't fix the issue on the <RESISTOR>R4802</RESISTOR> yet... I don't have another resistor with same specs to put there. \n\nThanks guys. \n\nThoughts?"
