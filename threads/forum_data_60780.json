I got from a customer a A1989 EMC 3214, board 820-00850-A  and it suffered medium liquid damage, in my opinion. I replaced some caps and res, some other ones I just reflux and it's turning on now. The problem is it doesn't load the OSX until the end, even from Internal or External drives. \n\nThe major problem I have now is, the [B]R4802 [\/B]lost its point 2, and looks like it's a point that sends energy to a lot of other points over the board. There's a whole in its place and I don't know how to solve this.\n\nI run Apple diagnosis and no-fault was mentioned. The battery is still working good.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks, Eduardo"}

It seems like it can throttle hard the CPU\/GPU if it detects a voltage drop on PPBUS_G3H (below 7.5V I think).\nR4802\/R4800 is just a voltage divider from PPBUS_G3H to PBUS_DIVIDER (pin 1 of U4801) so that should be easily repairable."}

The customer didn't care about the data, so I went to restore mode on the DFU mode... It appears to complete the process. The point is that, when I boot the computer holding option to choose and external drive, I can see my USB drive and, as I click on it to proceed, at same time it goes to the Internet Recovery... It won't be a problem if, when I chose my wifi network, and goes to the password screen to enter it, the mouse starts stepping and it never finishes the connection and do not proceed... \n\nI tried to start from Catalina and BigSur drives I have here. \n\nBTW, I don't fix the issue on the R4802 yet... I don't have another resistor with same specs to put there. \n\nThanks guys. \n\nThoughts?"}
