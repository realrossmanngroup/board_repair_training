        "820-00163": "What is 820-00163? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "SPI_MLB_CLK": "What is SPI_MLB_CLK? a SIGNAL.",

        "SPI_MLBROM_CS_L": "What is SPI_MLBROM_CS_L? SPI_MLBROM_CS_L is a signal that goes between the SPI ROM chip and another chip on machines with quad SPI, that can frequently corrode on 13‚Äù Macbook Air from 2015 because it is near the corner where liquid seeps in. This being corroded can stop PM_SLP_S4_L from being present. .",
        "SPI_MOSI": "What is SPI_MOSI? SPI_MOSI is a signal between the CPU or PCH and the SPI ROM bios chip that is necessary for the machine to POST and boot. If this signal line is corroded or the BIOS chip has failed then you will not get PM_SLP_S4_L and the machine will not boot. Very often this line is corroded by liquid damage. .",

        "SPI_MOSI_R": "What is SPI_MOSI_R? SPI_MOSI_R is a line between the SPI ROM BIOS chip and resistors that sit between it and the PCH. This often corrodes on Macbook Airs due to liquid damage and results in missing PM_SLP_S4_L and no bootup..",
