Powers on ok, screen connector and cable replaced as well as bunch of passives and the clock chip .\n\nTwo things are still awry . \n\n1. The camera is not present .\n2. The right arrow key of the keyboard is not recognised . \n\n\nAny thoughts on these?   How repairable are individual parts of the kB matrix?   I've not pulled one apart but I find it odd that one key is bust as opposed to a section.  \n\nAnd the camera?  Connector is ok.  Any thoughts on where to look for errors?  I guess this need to be debugged whilst turned on with photo booth loaded, or equivalent.  \n\nThanks Justin"

            "message": "I know duke mentioned cleaning the ME properly would not kill the camera/isight, and he is MUCH more knowledgeable than I am, but I have cleaned the ME on dozens of 3435/3437 boards and a large percentage of the time, iSight appears to no longer work (\"no camera detected\") after the cleaning. However, if you then update the BIOS via HS update or bless/mount, it does often restore iSight functionality (~75% of the time). When I say \"clean the ME\", I mean copy/paste a \"clean\" (default) ME region from the downloaded Intel ME region file (for the appropriate BIOS version) and pasting it over the corrupted/bad/old ME region. The only time I do this is when I am loading a totally fresh BIOS to a board for whatever reason--i.e. PCH replaced, damaged chip, missing chips altogether, etc. Any situation where a clean ME is needed. For reference--I do not use ANY ghostlyhaks files, ever. I use all my own files, pulled from my own fully-working boards and cleaned by me. To test this, I have pulled the BIOS from a fully-working board (with no problems, fully-working iSight, etc)--tested both a 3435 and 3437--and ONLY \"cleaned\" the ME region using the above method. Once I loaded the cleaned file, iSight no longer worked. I replaced the original file and iSight worked fine again. I also tested updating the BIOS, and it seemed to help sometimes, but not always. Again, this is with previously fully-working boards (including iSight). This DOES NOT seem to affect boards other than the 3435/3437 for whatever reason. I haven't messed with it enough to speak beyond this.\n\nI have noticed that manually updating the BIOS via bless/mount, or performing it with El Cap/HS update, has around a 75% chance of fixing iSight, but I have seen it NOT restore iSight as well. I don't know enough about ME regions to know *exactly* what breaks, but as duke has referenced before, the ME region pulled from the intel file is simply a DEFAULT SETTINGS ME region. I imagine whatever settings pertaining to iSight are incorrect/different and thus result in a non-functioning camera. I haven't had to clean the ME on a 3435/3437 board in months (market is softening for them), but last time I did, I had iSight issues as well. The way I do it is: Pull BIOS dump from working board (I have a library of ~15-20 good, working dumps per board model at this point that I have saved--all from fully-working boards that were not updated to El Cap); clean ME by pasting intel file default ME over KRID block with proper length; edit serial to match destination board; write to chip; PRAM reset on first boot; proceed to force-update (bless mount) to newest EFI version to have ME region corrected to perfectly match board/PCH. Works perfectly for most boards, but the 3435/3437 boards still seem to have iSight issues sometimes regardless.\n\nDuke, would you mind briefly noting what the proper way of cleaning an ME region is? I could definitely be doing it incorrectly, and don't want to spread misinformation. Since ME regions are board-specific, it would seem the only way to clean them is to reset to default settings (via the intel file) and then PRAM reset on first boot, right?"
