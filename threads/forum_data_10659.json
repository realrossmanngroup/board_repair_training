        "message":"I have this liquid damaged board that has a green light on the charger but no fan spin or vcore. There was liquid damage on c4902\/09 and the PP3v42 side was missing pads so I ran a wire on them to get PP3v42 on there.\nI have 8.6v on PPBUS_G3H and PPVRTC_G3H is present. Here are some power rails I found missing.\np5vsus_s5 is present \nno pp5v_SUS \nno pp5v_s3\/s0\nno pp3v3_s5\/s3\/s0\n\nHere are some of measurents I have taken while troubleshooting.\npin 5 of Q7822 fluctuates from around 1.45v to 1.05\nr7840 shows 4.94v on both sides\nPin 1 of C7841 shows 5.04v\n\nOn U7201(TPS51980)\nPins 12,21 and 23 all had the correct voltage present on them. Pin 4 (EN_1) has 0v on it.\nI traced the missing EN_1 to PM_SLP_S4_L and there was no voltage on there nor on PM_SLP_S5_L"
