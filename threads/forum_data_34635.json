When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

Bad magsafe i/o board, <RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR> and ISL.\nReplaced all said components, and now have 12.56V and a booting machine.\nThe problem is when both battery and charger are plugged in, the light on the charger goes dead and computer no longer recognizes it after about 45 secs.. I have to reset the charger by unplugging for 30 seconds and plugging back in, then it will turn green again.\nReverse Current Protection?\nWithout battery I have no problems.\nWill run on charged battery by itself.\nHave tried with multiple batteries.\nMultiple magsafes.\nThanks, have a good one."

            "message": "[USER=\"1404\"]jamiehorn1[/USER] \nAt the time when I replaced <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>/22 I was getting 3 Ohms on <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR>/52, so I figured everything was OK on the battery side. Shortly after my post,  <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>/22 went out again. This time <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR>/52 went out as well. Replaced everything again including <RESISTOR>R7150</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7120</RESISTOR> and transistors on Batt side and adapter side. Everything Is now working . Thanks for your input. Much appreciated."
