Almost every component on the board had some level of corrosion on it. The worst areas were around the ISL9240, the 3v8_AON MOSFETs and the speaker amps. I had to replace the ISL and almost all the caps and resistors around it. Replaced all the 3v8_AON MOSFETs and U5700. Replaced U8100 and UR760 also and had to run a wire to reconnect P3V8AON_PWR_EN. It finally now turns on and boots to the OS, but no sound from the internal speakers. When I attempt to play a video on YouTube, the video itself freezes as soon as it begins and then the video turns black. I can still see its playing because the time keeps going, but no sound comes from the speakers. If I connect headphones and try again, the video now plays fine and I do get good sound from the headphones. When you unplug the headphones, I do not get any sound from the internal speakers and the YouTube video freezes and the video goes black again. I checked the voltages and signals below and they seem fine and I do not find any shorts around the speaker amps. I do not get any voltage on the any of the amp outputs. \n\nPPBUS_AON - 12.01v\nPP3V8_AON - 3.8v\nPP1V8_AWAKE - 1.8v\nPP1V2_AWAKE - 1.2v\nSPKRAMP_RESET_L - 1.2v\nSPKRAMP_INT_L - 1.2v"}

I removed all 6 amps from the board and it still doing the same thing. I obviously get no sound without the amps but I can tell the computer is still freezing when you try and play sound. everything works fine with head phones though. Any idea what signals to check from the M1? I cannot find anything that seems off compared to a good board."}

Seems like damage to the M1, but its just weird how I cannot find any rails or signals that are shorted, or even low diode mode. Also strange that both left and right speakers have the same problem. It works perfectly fine with headphones connected also, so is it possible to trick the mac to output the audio from the headphone jack to the internal speakers instead? I know I would probably lose headphone functionality, but I would rather have working internal speakers then a working headphone jack.\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]Good Board[\/B][\/TD]\n[TD]No sound[\/TD]\n[TD]Playing sound[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]I2C_SPKRAMP_L_SCL[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]I2C_SPKRAMP_L_SDA[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_L_BCLK[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD].603v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_L_FSYNC[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]5mv[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_L_R2D[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]fluctuates[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_L_D2R[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD].460v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]I2C_SPKRAMP_R_SCL[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]I2C_SPKRAMP_R_SDA[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_R_BCLK[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]0.601v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_R_FSYNC[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]4.9mv[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_R_R2D[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]fluctuates[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_R_D2R[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD].430v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]\n\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]Bad Board[\/B][\/TD]\n[TD]No sound[\/TD]\n[TD]Playing sound[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]I2C_SPKRAMP_L_SCL[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]I2C_SPKRAMP_L_SDA[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_L_BCLK[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_L_FSYNC[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_L_R2D[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_L_D2R[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]I2C_SPKRAMP_R_SCL[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]I2C_SPKRAMP_R_SDA[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_R_BCLK[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_R_FSYNC[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_R_R2D[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]TDM_SPKRAMP_R_D2R[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]"}
