This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",

            "message": "This board had some pretty bad liquid damage and partial short on <SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL>. Almost every component on the board had some level of corrosion on it. The worst areas were around the <CHIP>ISL9240</CHIP>, the <SIGNAL>3V8_AON</SIGNAL> MOSFETs and the speaker amps. I had to replace the ISL and almost all the caps and resistors around it. Replaced all the <SIGNAL>3V8_AON</SIGNAL> MOSFETs and <CHIP>U5700</CHIP>. Replaced <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> and UR760 also and had to run a wire to reconnect <SIGNAL>P3V8AON_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>. It finally now turns on and boots to the OS, but no sound from the internal speakers. When I attempt to play a video on YouTube, the video itself freezes as soon as it begins and then the video turns black. I can still see its playing because the time keeps going, but no sound comes from the speakers. If I connect headphones and try again, the video now plays fine and I do get good sound from the headphones. When you unplug the headphones, I do not get any sound from the internal speakers and the YouTube video freezes and the video goes black again. I checked the voltages and signals below and they seem fine and I do not find any shorts around the speaker amps. I do not get any voltage on the any of the amp outputs. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> - 12.01v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL> - 3.8v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_AWAKE</SIGNAL> - 1.8v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_AWAKE</SIGNAL> - 1.2v\n<SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 1.2v\n<SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_INT_L</SIGNAL> - 1.2v"

Seems like damage to the M1, but its just weird how I cannot find any rails or signals that are shorted, or even low diode mode. Also strange that both left and right speakers have the same problem. It works perfectly fine with headphones connected also, so is it possible to trick the mac to output the audio from the headphone jack to the internal speakers instead? I know I would probably lose headphone functionality, but I would rather have working internal speakers then a working headphone jack.\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]Good Board[/B][/TD]\n[TD]No sound[/TD]\n[TD]Playing sound[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>I2C_SPKRAMP_L_SCL</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>I2C_SPKRAMP_L_SDA</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_L_BCLK</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD].603v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_L_FSYNC</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]5mv[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_L_R2D</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]fluctuates[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_L_D2R</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD].460v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>I2C_SPKRAMP_R_SCL</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>I2C_SPKRAMP_R_SDA</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_R_BCLK</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]0.601v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_R_FSYNC</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]4.9mv[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_R_R2D</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]fluctuates[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_R_D2R</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD].430v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][B]Bad Board[/B][/TD]\n[TD]No sound[/TD]\n[TD]Playing sound[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>I2C_SPKRAMP_L_SCL</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>I2C_SPKRAMP_L_SDA</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_L_BCLK</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_L_FSYNC</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_L_R2D</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_L_D2R</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD][/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>I2C_SPKRAMP_R_SCL</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>I2C_SPKRAMP_R_SDA</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[TD]1.22v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_R_BCLK</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_R_FSYNC</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_R_R2D</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]<SIGNAL>TDM_SPKRAMP_R_D2R</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[TD]0v[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]"
