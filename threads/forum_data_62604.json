There is no image on the display, but the backlight is on. There are no signs of liquid damage on the display or connector. I tried another known working screen and ended up with the same result. I proceeded to remove the logic board to inspect. There is absolutely zero signs of liquid anywhere. I removed the display connector and there is no liquid damage at all. No burns or bad pins on the board or the cable. I then proceeded to test for shorts on any of the lines on JP600. None of the lines are shorted to ground. I reinstalled the logic board and connected to another MacBook (2017 13\" A1706) to see if the device was stuck in DFU mode, and it is not (it is booted when powered on). I have also tried connecting an external display and there is no image. Could this be a bad CPU perhaps (fried graphics)?"}
