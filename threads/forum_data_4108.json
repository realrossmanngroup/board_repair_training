        "message":"[SIZE=14px]Hi there,\n\nfirst of all I wanted to introduce myself: My name is Jan and I run a repair company in Germany. We are specialized in board repairs for Apple and Samsung devices.\nI am new to the board and hope we can learn from each other with every new case being discussed here.\n\nToday I need some help with a 15\" Retina 820-3332 board.\n\nThe board came in with liquid spill, which we cleaned up. After this, we replaced the eDP connector and a whole bunch of smaller parts in that area. After that, the machine booted fine, except there was no video. Trying an external screen showed that the machine booted into the OS and runs without any problems. As soon as we disconnected the external screen, the internal video magically appeared and stayed until the machine was rebooted.\n\nThis can be done over and over again. We then repeated the ultrasonic cleaning and ran ASD which showed some errors with the GPU and the GMUX. So we reflowed U9100 and the image appeared right after starting. We tried this around 10 times and were ready to hand out to the customer but then the issue resurfaced. Another reflow of U9100 didn't help.\n\nSo this is the history:\n\nWater damage repair (ultrasonic)\neDP replacement together with almost all little parts in that corner\nUltrasonic\nGMUX reflow\nGPU replacement\n\nThese are the errors from the latest ASD:[\/SIZE]\n\n[CODE]\n[12\/31\/14 16:04:51]  Current (ID0R) -- DC In (test #1) - Sensor Reads Within Operating Range\n  - Check to ensure that sensor reads within operating range.\n[16:04:51]  ERROR -- 3 [Sensor reading below low point] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:19]  Video Controller Internal (test #40) - Gmux switch to IG and Verify\n  - test will switch display to IG and Verify\n[16:29:24]  ERROR -- 28 [Mux switching Failed...Didn't switch error] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:24]  Video Controller Internal (test #2) - OpenGL Point Test\n  - Render Points\n[16:29:24]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:25]  Video Controller Internal (test #3) - OpenGL Line Test\n  - Render Lines\n[16:29:25]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:25]  Video Controller Internal (test #4) - OpenGL Triangle Test\n  - Render Triangles\n[16:29:25]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:25]  Video Controller Internal (test #5) - OpenGL Quad Test\n  - Render Quads\n[16:29:25]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:25]  Video Controller Internal (test #7) - OpenGL Rectangle Test\n  - Render Rectangles\n[16:29:26]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:26]  Video Controller Internal (test #8) - OpenGL Cube Test\n  - Render Cubes\n[16:29:26]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:26]  Video Controller Internal (test #9) - OpenGL Cube with Fog Test\n  - Render Cube with Fog\n[16:29:26]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:26]  Video Controller Internal (test #10) - OpenGL Wireframe Model Test\n  - Render Wireframe Model\n[16:29:26]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:26]  Video Controller Internal (test #11) - OpenGL Solid Red Model Test\n  - Render Solid Red Model\n[16:29:27]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:27]  Video Controller Internal (test #12) - OpenGL Solid Red Model with Fog Test\n  - Render Solid Red Model with Fog\n[16:29:27]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n[12\/31\/14 16:29:27]  Video Controller Internal (test #70) - Fragment Instruction Test\n  - Tests each instruction of the ARB fragment program instruction by doing calculation and comparing actual against expected\n[16:29:27]  ERROR - 80000003 [Unsupported] -- TEST FAILED\n\n[\/CODE]\n\n[SIZE=14px]Any ideas what that can be?\n\nThank you so much![\/SIZE]"
