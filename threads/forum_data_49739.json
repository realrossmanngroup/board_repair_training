Store claims it came in still turning on but just wouldn't load OSX all the way. I have tried loading my test OSX but I always have same issue. They replaced board and it loaded fine after that. They put this board in ultrasonic before I received and the only minor liquid spots I see are by the SMC.\n\nDo not know where to begin on a repair like this. Should SMC be reballed first in this case or should I check something else? Board overall looks very clean. Cant find any obvious damaged components."}

Inspect very closely by U6100, U1900, U1950 for corroded resistors, chips, traces etc. Pre-ultrasoniced boards can suck because you never know if anything was near the CPU to begin with"}

No question mark folder or apple logo. Thought maby had bad SMC from donar so decided to put original SMC on.\n\nSame problem with original SMC now. Is this a bios issue? Should I check something else?"}
