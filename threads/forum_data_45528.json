        "D7050": "What is D7050? Diodes between SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL and ground, these data lines allow the battery to communicate with the battery charging chip and the SMC..",
        "C7198": "What is C7198? a CAPACITOR.",
        "D7010": "What is D7010? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year retina model macbook pros, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "R7185": "What is R7185? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7180": "What is R7180? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "R7181": "What is R7181? a RESISTOR.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015."

But the problem is <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>. I replace and the board work's well!!\n\nthank you  one more time"
