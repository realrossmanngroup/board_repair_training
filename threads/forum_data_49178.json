With my Power supply i put a wire with 1V on pin pin 2 for find the bad component and only heat <RESISTOR>R8131</RESISTOR>! But the stupid think is i remove the <RESISTOR>R8131</RESISTOR> and when i put 1v on L7095 the pin 1 off <RESISTOR>R8131</RESISTOR> keeps burning. when i put ?lcool isoprop?lico on area off <RESISTOR>R8131</RESISTOR> i can see the alcohol evaporate at the pin1 off <RESISTOR>R8131</RESISTOR>. I don't have others components heating on this board!  \n\nAlready replace <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> for a new one and same history! \n\nHow do I find this short?? \n\nThanks"
