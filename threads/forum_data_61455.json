        "820-01598": "What is 820-01598? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP1V8_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V8_SLPS2R? PP1V8_SLPS2R is a 1.8v power rail present when the system is in a SLPS2R state. .",
        "U7800": "What is U7800? a CHIP.",
        "CD3217": "What is CD3217? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "U6903": "What is U6903? This chip is responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H in 2016-2018 model Macbook logic boards.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP3V3_G3H_RTC": "What is PP3V3_G3H_RTC? PP3V3_G3H_RTC Is one of the first rails that has to come on in order for the USB-C mux chip to be powered in the T2 chip Macbook Pros..",
        "1V8_SLPS2R": "What is 1V8_SLPS2R? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V1_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V1_SLPS2R? The PP1V1_SLPS2R power rail in the MacBook schematic provides a 1.1-volt supply in a specific low-power state indicated by the \"_SLPS2R\" suffix and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP1V2_AWAKE": "What is PP1V2_AWAKE? The PP1V2_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides 1.2 volts and is associated with the machine's awake state and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
        "PP3V3_AWAKE": "What is PP3V3_AWAKE? a SIGNAL.",

            "message": "This board was liquid damaged but not very badly. Some corrosion around <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground. I removed <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> but it was still shorted so I injected voltage and found <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> was getting hot. I removed <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> and the short was gone. I replaced both <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> from the same model donor board, and I now get 3.3v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> and 12.3v on PPBUS but only about .450v on <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL>. I have 0v on the other coils around <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> also. I assumed the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> I got from the donor was bad so I removed it, reballed it, and put it back on the donor board, just to see if I would get 1.8v on PP1V8 and I do get that voltage on the donor, so I don't think this <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> chip is bad. I have reballed it again and re-soldered it to this board and now back to about .350v-.450v on PP1V8 so something on this board appears to be pulling it down. I do get 20v on this board so idk if that rules out an issue with the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s and T2 or not. Any idea what to check?"
