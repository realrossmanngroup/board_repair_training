        "message":"Hi everybody,\n\ni received a MacBookAir from 2016 (820-00165-A) with a liquid da, U5800mage. I replaced components around U8300, many components around U6101 such as U3210, U7701 (Baclkight IC) and the LCD-Connector (there were some burnmarks on pins 2-4).\nI also replaced the cable of the display.\nSo far so good - device is booting with chimes and i got external display (unforunately i lose signal after few minutes) but i don't get internal display. \nI got the initial 3.3V on  PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD  in the first few seconds after booting but they don't stay.\n\nSo my question is: Where is my fault? Could it be a badly reballed Backlight IC? Or is it a bad LCD connector (I unsoldered one of a donor board and reused it)?\nIs there any way to check why the screen is not detected? \nIt's not the screen - i already tested it with a kown working assembly.\n\nThank you and best regards\nDudidpupan"
