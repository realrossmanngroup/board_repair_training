            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> ,battery \"X\" not being detected, not the simple cases usually encountered\n\nHi guys,having a strange <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board giving me headache.\n\nproblem is battery not being detected, thought should be a piece of cake as fixed a lot previously already.\nusually only 3 things , which all had been checked in this case.\n\n\nso here is the details,\n\nproblem is on <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA</SIGNAL> which only has 2.5v, thought would be either isl , bill connector or smc pulling the voltage down.\n\nI check the ground resistance on pin1 of <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR> before I did any replacements, so pin 1 <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> is 610 , pin 1 on <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR> is 497\n\ngood board would have 400 something on both\n\nI already thought it strange at that point, since usually the ground resistance would be pulled down, not higher\n\n\n\nso what happened next was, SMC, ISL both got replaced. bill connector removed. <DIODE>D6950</DIODE> replaced. <CAPACITOR>C6952</CAPACITOR> replaced.\n\nthen same result. same ground resistance, same 2.5v (roughly)\n\n\nso really have no idea what it can be, i checked the trace too, but they don't seem to be broken\n\nany ideas?"
