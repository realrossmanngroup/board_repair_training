After clean-up I replaced <CHIP>ISL9240</CHIP> and a few other corroded components. PPBUS was shorted to ground and I found <CHIP>U7210</CHIP>, one of the CPU power chips, shorted; replacing it removed the short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL>.\n\nNow, I get 20V on USB-C drawing 0.51A, PPBUS is 12.6V, and I have SSD and G3S rails. But no startup. DFU Restore proceeded to the padlock symbol, but the target computer showed no signs of life other than trackpad clicking.\n\nWhat’s the best way to troubleshoot whether the short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> has damaged the CPU, before I spend a lot of time fixing other issues on this board such as LCD backlight?"
