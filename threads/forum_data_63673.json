Got orange led on the magsafe plug.\nWith multimeter I could see that <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>, PP1V5R1V35_GPU_REG_R, <SIGNAL>P1V05_S0GPU_REG_R</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0_REG_R</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V35_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> are trying to start up, there is a voltage for a fraction of a second. \n\nCouple of times after powering the board up, I saw PP1V5R1V35_GPU_REG_R at 1.5V and fans started to spin. It happened twice.\nAnother two suspicious things:\n1. There was a blown ceramic cap at PP1V5R1V35_GPU_REG_R line, however without making short circuit. After removal I found that pad connected to PP1V5R1V35_GPU_REG_R  was not making contact - pcb pad was ripped off. Cap itself was shorted. Didn't look like it was mechanical damage.\n2. SPI flash was soldered - there is residue of a flux. Not sure if it is relevant to problem with startup sequence.\n\nResistance at <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is ~35 Ohm, <SIGNAL>P1V05_S0GPU_REG_R</SIGNAL> ~200Ohm, PP1V5R1V35_GPU_REG_R ~150Ohm. Could not find any visually bad component/short circuit.\n\nNeed some help with further debug."
