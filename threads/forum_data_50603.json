        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "EDP_PANEL_PWR": "What is EDP_PANEL_PWR? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SCL is a clock line on the data line between the system management controller(SMC), temperature sensors, GPU, and ALS(ambient light sensor). If this line is pulled down the machine may run slow or have the fans run fast all the time because the SMC can’t tell what the temperature of parts of the machine like fin stack are. Usual problem is bad webcam, unplug webcam to see if it fixes problem. .",
        "SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SDA is a data line between the system management controller(SMC), temperature sensors, GPU, and ALS(ambient light sensor).

Usual problem is bad webcam, unplug webcam to see if it fixes problem. .",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",

CRAZY\n\nReplaced both flex and LIO board: same\n\nSo wondering about USB issue shooting down the others signals\nPlugged an USB mouse on the Motherboard USB port with the Flex disconnected : [B]NO Activity[/B]\n\nSo now should I focus more on the USB Level or more on J9500?\n\n\nBest Regards"
