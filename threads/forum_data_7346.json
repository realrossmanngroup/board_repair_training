The board is working fine again except it's not recognizing any batteries. On the pullup resistors I'm getting 3.42V on the pin 1 side and 3.42V (with normal switching down) on pin 2 of R5380 but pin 2 of R5381 is peaking out at 2.4V with a slight pulse down. I switched it out with no change. Any ideas why it might be doing this?"}

If I knew it was going to fix it I could justify putting the time in to reball it and swap it out but I just don't have the time to invest in it right now. Especially when it's a 2013 board and I have 2015 boards I'm working on that I could throw in there instead. I may give a go at some point though. I'll post the results if I do swap it out."}
