Pin 12 <SIGNAL>PM_EN_FET_P12V_S5_SSD</SIGNAL> had no voltage, let me be guided by the voltage that reaches <RESISTOR>R7698</RESISTOR> <SIGNAL>PM_EN_FET_P12V_S5_SSD</SIGNAL>. I thought that this entered pin 12 of the <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> and it is not.\n\nAnalyzing well who arrives at that pin 12 is <SIGNAL>PM_PGOOF_FET_P12V_S5_SSD_K</SIGNAL> that comes from the <CHIP>U8490</CHIP>. Heat it up a bit and you're good to go.\n\nThank you. Apologies.\n\nThank you [USER=682]@2informaticos[/USER]"
