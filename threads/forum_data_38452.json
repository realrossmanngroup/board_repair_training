        "message":"I'm a little confused by this one. The only liquid damage is in the upper lefthand corner beside the backlight circuit. I have checked that area for shorts with no luck. I have the g3 hot rails, but no P5vS0 rail. And I think (I am new to this) the P5vS3 rail is required for P5vs0 to work. I do not have P5vs3 either. Any guidance on finding out what is going on is appreciated. thanks!\n\n\nOne other interesting thing: I check P5vs3 in continuity mode and everything looks good, but when plugging in DC power the impedance drops down to around 18 ohms (sill 0v)\nI'm checking the line now for some mosfets that may have opened to a shorted line or something."

This maybe means there should be voltage on this pin too to enable the circuit,  but when I look upstream from there, there are two transistors that seem to come from the cpu to send a signal to it. There could be something wrong with one of the transistors or something else, but it seems likely to me at this point to be a dead mcp. \nThe weird part to me, is that on the schematic the EN_L pin seems to be only related to wlan, which shouldn\u2019t be needed to achieve an S5 state. \n\nI couldnt find find a data sheet on the chip to tell what that pin did, but I think the pin 4 is preventing it from turning on."
