All those coils and areas looked good. SMC Bypass didn't work.\n\nI checked solders around U7650 and reflowed it. Something smelled like it burned up while putting heat to board. Board showed same symptoms initially and was pulling 20V, with rails pulsing after this but when I went back for second check no longer boosts to 20V intake. NOw stuck at 5v. Makes no sense to me that something burned up. Is there something that would be temp sensitive near U7650? Or U7650 burned maybe? Thinking maybe this was the case and not seeing any shorts on PP3V3 G3H or around CD3215's, I replaced U7650. NO change. I hate the newer boards..."}
