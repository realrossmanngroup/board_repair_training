I have replaced this IC. This is the only area where I saw liquid. The mac has 12.28v and also 3.8V on PP3V8_AON. Tried to get it in DFU mode but that did not work. Area around the Type-C charge chips looks clean. I have no voltage around U8100 and U7700 accept 1.8v. No light on the Macsafe as well. Tried with both Type C and Magsafe, both 12.28v + 3.8v. Is UP800 critical for boot or it should start without this?\n\nPP1V8_aon = 1.8v\nP3V8_AON = 3.8v\nPPBUS_AON = 12.28 (both from magsafe & Type C charger, no battery connected"}
