            "message": "Hi Guys I have a 14 inch Macbook pro with liquid damage around UP800. I have replaced this IC. This is the only area where I saw liquid. The mac has 12.28v and also 3.8V on <SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL>. Tried to get it in DFU mode but that did not work. Area around the Type-C charge chips looks clean. I have no voltage around <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> accept 1.8v. No light on the Macsafe as well. Tried with both Type C and Magsafe, both 12.28v + 3.8v. Is UP800 critical for boot or it should start without this?\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_AON</SIGNAL> = 1.8v\n<SIGNAL>P3V8_AON</SIGNAL> = 3.8v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> = 12.28 (both from magsafe & Type C charger, no battery connected"
