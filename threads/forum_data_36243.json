The backlight is just the adhesive black cover but should be replaced as the old one will have exposed conductive material that may short out the keyboard if stuck back on.\n\nBest would probably be to buy from someone not Chinese that has stripped one for parts, that way you know you get a good quality part not from a dumpster."
