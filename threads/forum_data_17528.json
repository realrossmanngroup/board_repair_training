        "message":"hi , \n          i have got a 2012 a1286 , 820-3330-b board and it was liquid damaged , screen cable and connector both damaged , As no 2012 screen connector (silver styled) is available anywhere in uk. so now planning to replace the connector with the older type(golden) connector rather than 2012 (silver) connector and fit the old 2011 (golden) type cable . \ni hope u guys can understand what i have written above .\n\nhas anyone tried that and is it ok as i am assuming that there isnt anything different in the screen pins layout .\nkindly advise\nthanks"
