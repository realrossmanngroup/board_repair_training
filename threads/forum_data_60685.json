It starts with a charged battery but with a charger will get green light but power cycling with fan spin and green light going off then coming back on and fan spin\/green light. I\u2019ve tried replacing Q7030, Q7035, Q7055 and U7000 and have checked R7021 & R7022 at c7020 and get 20 ohms, R7051 and R7052 are also correct. Anyone have any ideas?"}
