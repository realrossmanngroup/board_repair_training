Finding a short to ground when nothing gets hot on the board","user_id":16,"username":"supamodz","post_date":"2018-03-22 12:00:49","message":"Hey guys this is a general question about finding shorts. This problem happens to me from time to time and i have no clue on what to do.\nFrom time to time i will get a board where i find a short to ground, so i then would inject voltage in that circuit, but when voltage is injected the voltage drops on psu but amps do not drop. When i check around   board using a flir thermal camera nothing gets hot  which makes the short almost impossible to find. How do you find a short when this happens?  This annoys the shit out of me when i come across these types of shorts looking for suggestions."}

How do you find the untraceable shorts when they come your way?"}

If you have a full hard short injecting any voltage will pull maximum current from the PSU."}

Anything over a few dozen Ohm will not cause enough current draw to heat something up."}
