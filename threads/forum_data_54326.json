        "820-3435": "What is 820-3435? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7005": "What is D7005? a DIODE.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",

        "PP1V2_S3": "What is PP1V2_S3? PP1V2_S3 is a 1.2v power rail present when the machine is in an S3 suspend to RAM state.",
        "PP1V8_S3": "What is PP1V8_S3? The PP1V8_S3 signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides a voltage of 1.8 volts during the S3 power state. The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",
        "PM_SLP_S0_L": "What is PM_SLP_S0_L? a SIGNAL.",

This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. ."
