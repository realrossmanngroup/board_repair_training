PPBUS shorted in the same! \n\nIf i remove <CHIP>U7330</CHIP> short goes away!! and if i measure resistance on L7330 i have 0 ohm! \n\nalready soldered a wire on L7330 with 1.1V and consume 2A. Still hoped it was a capacitor but i'm wrong! nothing burn!! \n\nMore ideas?? Processor dead?? \n\nthanks"
