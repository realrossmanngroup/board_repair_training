It powers on but no data.\n\nIf I plug in a mouse or a keyboard it works fine so I guess usb2 is ok.\nThe LIO usb port is fine both USB3 and USB2 are working.\n\nThere is only diode and caps on the usb 3  transmit and receive lines witch check fine, after that it goes directly to PCH ;(\nDiode mode on USB3_EXTA_R2D_C_N and USB3_EXTA_R2D_C_P are 0,344 witch looks good compared to other board...Also continuity and diode mode on each pin matches an other board.\n\nLooks like I am screwed, do you have an idea my last resort will be an ultrasonic...\n\nThanks"}
