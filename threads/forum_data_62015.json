        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
