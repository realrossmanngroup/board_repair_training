        "U5701": "What is U5701? this is the keyboard controller chip that takes the keyboard and trackpad input and turns it into a USB device signal for the machine to process. If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",

        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

Trackpad movement does not work in EFI or OS, but click/activation function of trackpad works in both EFI and OS. Have tried 3 test units (that are all known-good), and same behavior in each. \n\n- No liquid damage; perfectly clean board.\n- Have checked all relevant resistors on J5800/<CHIP>U5701</CHIP> circuit, all check out fine.\n- Missing <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_CUMULUS</SIGNAL>\n- <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> is present\n- Replaced <CHIP>U5701</CHIP> and <CHIP>U2700</CHIP> out of desperation (no change)\n- <SIGNAL>USB_TPAD_N</SIGNAL> is missing at <RESISTOR>R5702</RESISTOR>; is this normal, though?\n\nWhat continuity should I be checking from J5800 to <CHIP>U5701</CHIP> for this particular behavior? I have a feeling <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> cumulus is the issue here, but can't locate the cause for it missing.\n\nThanks for all help."
