Trackpad movement does not work in EFI or OS, but click\/activation function of trackpad works in both EFI and OS. Have tried 3 test units (that are all known-good), and same behavior in each. \n\n- No liquid damage; perfectly clean board.\n- Have checked all relevant resistors on J5800\/U5701 circuit, all check out fine.\n- Missing PP5V_S5_CUMULUS\n- PP3V3_S4 is present\n- Replaced U5701 and U2700 out of desperation (no change)\n- USB_TPAD_N is missing at R5702; is this normal, though?\n\nWhat continuity should I be checking from J5800 to U5701 for this particular behavior? I have a feeling PP5V_S5 cumulus is the issue here, but can't locate the cause for it missing.\n\nThanks for all help."}

Quick question--will PP18V5_Z2 be present if L5800 is \"NO STUFF\", i.e. this isn't a Z2 particular board? Aren't these boards \"either\" Z2 or \"PSOC\"? Or am I confusing this? Will check that now."}

Makes sense; PP18V5_Z2 missing; I checked vin for U5805 and it was present, so replaced U5805 and all is well. Thanks, Aprendiz! You guys can close this one."}
