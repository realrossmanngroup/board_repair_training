            "message": "Hi.\n\nI have this board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> it was not powering on, and it was full of dust. I did the cleaning and at first, it didn't turn on, but then it started. I did the usual check on all power lines and on a few, the diode mode measurements are lower, but it still powers on. I found on QB701 Pin 1 diode mode was 0.150 and on another board compared it was 0.300. I took out QB701 and the 0.150 was on <SIGNAL>P5VUSBCT_DRVH</SIGNAL>, and with a replacement of QB701 solved the diode mode measurement. On the other side of the board on L8000 pin 2 side I have 0.028 and on L7960 Pin 2 0.043. The MacBook still powers on and charges normally, I'm just wondering do I need to go through the circuit to solve also this.\n\nL7960 Pin 2 side is <SIGNAL>PPVCCIO_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>\nL8000 Pin 2 side is <SIGNAL>PP1V_PCH_REG_R</SIGNAL>\n\nNote that I lifted the Coils to measure properly on which side is the lower diode mode, and also not plugged in  :ROFLMAO: . Also, the Voltages on the PIn 2 sides VSW on both coils are higher which should be normal."
