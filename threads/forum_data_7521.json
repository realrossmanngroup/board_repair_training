        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF": "What is SMC_ONOFF? SMC_ONOFF is a signal that tells the machine that the power button has been pressed so it knows to turn on, or turn off. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",

            "message": "Hey,\nSo this is a fun one. I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> clean of liquid damage.\nIt originally came in with no green light, i gave the SMC a reflow and got the light back. happy days, ultrasonically cleaned, sent out, all working.\n\nIt came back a few days later with the same fault., knowing SMC's are not flip chip or real heat sensitive, i think maybe there is some bad pad wetting or something. I remove and reball the SMC. No dice. \nI replace the SMC with another pull, Same symptoms. \n\n8.6V is present (first thing i checked) \nPP3v42 is present\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is present\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is present\n<SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> is present\nI/O connector and cable are clean- the board has been tested with new replacements.\nDC board has 3.4V on the centre pin, suggesting that both <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> have made it to the DCIN board with no issues.\n\n<CHIP>U7000</CHIP> has been replaced for good measure. \nIve ran jumper wires to rebuild important traces to ensure there are no cracks in then traces. No symptom change at all. \n\nSo here's whats confusing, all the signals are being generated and pulled up just fine, however the SMC isnt communicating with the charger. I have a feeling it has to be a bad ceramic 0201 capacitor in the SMC support circuit but that in itself is a rabbit hole. Anyone got any ideas?"
