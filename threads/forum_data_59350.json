I am certain this laptop has never been touched, there has been no prior attempt to repair it as I know the previous owner who is responsible for the spill.\nThe CD3215s look fine as my charger goes to 20V, however the board only takes 20mA.\nI am reading 0.2V on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and I am measuring 4 Ohms to ground, which I believe is a short although I don't have another board to get a reference from.\n\nI am planning to inject 0.8V into this power rail in order to find out where the short comes from, but are there other things I should check first ? Like shorted MOSFETs or things like that. I don't want to end up sending 12V into other power rails and turn this potentially repairable board into something that would be impossible to fix."

CPU VCCGT has 3 phases and there is no external mosfet, they must be directly in the regulator chips (<CHIP>U7410</CHIP> <CHIP>U7420</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7430</CHIP>).\nI guess I don't really have a way to know which one has the short, so I have to remove them one by one until the short is gone. If I'm lucky it will be gone after removing the first one, but murphy will likely make it be the last one I remove I suppose.\nThat being said, I assume there is a good chance that this board has a dead CPU, right ? If that rail is shorted to <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, and to ground at the same time, there's still a good chance that 12V went into my CPU at some point.\nOK, well I'll report back once I have removed that short.\nThanks"

They all have a high resistance to ground on their regulator side, but still about 3 Ohms to ground on their CPU side.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is no longer shorted to ground. I haven't tried to power the board without the coils in order to see if I get proper voltage there now, although I don't think it would harm, right ?\nBut with that short to ground on the CPU side of those coils, I'm afraid the CPU is dead. Of course there are still a bunch of caps on that power rail which could be shorted to ground, so there is still some hope. None of them visually look bad though. Should I proceed with injecting voltage into that rail now ?"
