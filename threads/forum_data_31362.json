System is completely unresponsive to the Power Button.\n\nWhen system boots up, it works flawlessly, and can be on/in sleep for days on end and start right back up and work normally. Charger cable can be detached and it will work perfectly. When plugged in, get both green light on the magsafe and orange when charging. If I shut it off, I can't turn it back on unless I disconnect/reconnect the battery, then plug it in the charger.\n\nBattery is showing 'Service Battery', but does charge, and hold a 4hr+ charge. When I first got this system in, the status was 'Replace Soon', and it has been sitting in storage for 5 monthes unused since then.\n\nI believe system had some liquid damage based on the water stains on some pads (pictured), but it was cleaned with isopropyl before ending up in my hands, so unsure about the affected area.\n\n\nThings I have checked:\n\n<RESISTOR>R5014</RESISTOR> has 3.47V on both pins\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> 3.47V when on, doesn't move when power is pressed, stays at 3.47V. Measured from the few resistors near the keyboard connector.\n\nNoticed there is no <RESISTOR>R5016</RESISTOR> resister, just two pads, and doesn't look like there was solder there before. One side of the <RESISTOR>R5016</RESISTOR> pads is 3.47V, the other 0V.\n\nDon't notice any corrosion around <CHIP>U5010</CHIP>, and it appears to have <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> at 3.47V\n\n\nInterestingly, if I measure <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> using the probe point above UF5010, I get 3.47V, but the computer shuts off immediately.\n\nPhotos attached of the <CHIP>U5010</CHIP>, SMC area, and <RESISTOR>R5016</RESISTOR> area."
