            "message": "Liquid damage from water. Corrosion around UD560 connections under that chip are now good. DCIN voltage is 5.16V on both ports and zero amps drawing. Checking the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s I'm getting the LDO's on the chip related to the powered port but the readings on the opposite chip are pulsing and erratic. This happens regardless of which port is being used... stable voltage on the connected port and unstable voltage on the unconnected port/<CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>. I found this rather odd but haven't worked much on boards with <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s. Checked for shorts on big coils and all at least appear to be good at .100 or higher."

Fixed and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> is stable but <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s are still acting the same so it appears <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> is affected. I would guess there was liquid contact there. Heating with flux gets the board to start trying to take amps but just cycles. Do you have any knowledge of the <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> Apple chip it appears that it deals with PMU slave function so that would probably explain why the non connected <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> unstable. My only thoughts were to try to reball it and pray as I'm guessing it's probably programmed being it has an Apple logo on it haha."
