I have here  <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00138</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a board after water damaged on keyboard. i removed board and check under microscope but i can't see any water damaged on it (checked 3 times). Laptop no powering up when i connect charger. Somebody told me that board need to be connected to good battery is that true? Don't have board view to check voltage on board. Anybody had this problem b4?"
