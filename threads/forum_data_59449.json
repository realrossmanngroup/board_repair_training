            "message": "Lighht water damage (as if) but I had been having to hold the MagSafe at a special angle and gently letting it go for it to charge orange.   Then it just stopped charging.  Bought new charger, wont work.    I bought a used IO board from Ebay but the mic ribbon didnt fit and even with that, it didnt work anyway.  Also, now the USB next to the charging port doesnt seem to work now either.   Any suggestions?    I attempted to join the special paid forum but never received a confirmation.   Should I just give up and go to another Mac?   I travel a lot and really like a lighter machine.    Thanks much!"
