Was no green light on it at all. Found a problem with the ISL6259 (DCIN Pin3 was 3ohm short to ground when ISL6259 was on board) which i've replaced and now getting the green light but it still wont start. PPBUS_G3H is pulsing between 13.3v and 2.5V. \n\nCannot see any shorts on PPBUS_G3H and have replaced the ISL6259 again now but still the same behaviour. \n\nHas anyone seen this before and knows which component is the likely culprit?\n\nDC_IN voltage is 16.5V as I would expect now (it was 1V before changing the ISL originally)"}

The machine does however have another issue - when I disconnect the charger and reconnect it then the light comes orange on the charger but it doesn't start to charge the battery. If I SMC reset the system then it will start charging the battery again until I reconnect the charger."}
