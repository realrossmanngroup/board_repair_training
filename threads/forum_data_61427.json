Was no green light on it at all. Found a problem with the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> (DCIN Pin3 was 3ohm short to ground when <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> was on board) which i've replaced and now getting the green light but it still wont start. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is pulsing between 13.3v and 2.5V. \n\nCannot see any shorts on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and have replaced the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> again now but still the same behaviour. \n\nHas anyone seen this before and knows which component is the likely culprit?\n\n<SIGNAL>DC_IN</SIGNAL> voltage is 16.5V as I would expect now (it was 1V before changing the ISL originally)"
