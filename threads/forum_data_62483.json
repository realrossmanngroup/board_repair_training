Customer said the webcam stopped working. Keyboard was also completely sticky as well as power button, also some wine spilled around T2 chip area. Mac was still turned on. Explained to the customer we had to clean it, and there is a chance it might stop working during this attempt, which now, of course, it did. Board looks super clean after ultrasonic. Even before that, no corrosion only some sticky wine. All area look good. What I get now is 20v an 0.0 - 0.07 amp. T2 gets slightly warm. Tried DFU mode but I think this only works when stuck at 5v? Also not sure the keyboard and power button work, have no other housing to test :(. PPBUS switches between 12.64 and 12.32v. Tried also with battery connected and of course original charger, both 60 and 85 wats:unsure:."}
