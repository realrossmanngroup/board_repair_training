Fans still ramp up slowly and Macbook is slow.\n\nI've run ASD without Memory Test cause it takes long and it PASSED all.\n\nNo serial number being shown in About this Mac. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.26V.\n\nWhy didn't ASD throw out some sensor issue or something like that?"

            "message": "12.26 means there is an issue around the SMBUS data lines. It will of course run slow and ramp the fans without the trackpad plugged in...First make sure you test with known good parts to make sure that isn't the issue. If PPBUS is 12.26 without anything attached, inspect for corrosion near the SMC. Might even be a good idea to remove the edge bonding and run some flux under it with heat to clear out any corrosion under it."
