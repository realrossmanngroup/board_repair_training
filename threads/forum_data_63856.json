Probably never disassembeled... It spins the fan if plugged in but thats it. No cime, No USB, no beep without ram. Its missing PPVCORE_SO_CPU, PP0V75_SO_DDRVTT and PPVCORE_SO_AXG. I followed that path and came to PLT_RESET_L missing. CPU_IMVP seems fine and CPU_VCORE has ~5 Ohms resistance to GND. Is that to low pointing to the CPU? I replaced U7400 and U2650 but no change. Any ideas what could cause this? Also i an not 100% sure how the power up sequence works here and what needs to be present first."}

I inspected that area already closely and havent found any issues. Also i had it in the UC after i cant fix it on my own. Ill try heating both - nothing to loose here."}
