If pin 2 check resistance between that pin and all the big coils to make sure no high side fets are short. Then, inject 1 volt to start into PPBUS to make sure none of the CPU fets or the CPU itself get hot first. Slowly increase voltage till short is obvious. Very common that one of the big tantalums fails on these."
