The customer brought it because it was shutting down out of nowhere. What should I measure first?\n\nThank you"}

Big coil L7520 seems to give a tiny voltage 0.02v at initial contact, but then drops to zero. Big coil L7130 is 12.50V. \n\nMeasured PP3v3_s5 is 3.32v and _SUS is 0V \n\n\nKind reminder, the Macbook is not steady. Sometimes it will not boot at all; other times it boots but shuts down after some seconds and other times it boots into the operating system and can work for several minutes."}
