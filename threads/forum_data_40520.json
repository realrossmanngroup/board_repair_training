I think because the the voltage to that rail is non-existent \/ insufficient to produce heat, an alcohol test proved futile.  Is injecting voltage an option, or should I measure more individual resistors, etc?\n\nThanks a bazillion!"}

Don't bother with it\n\nI don't think PP1V05_S0 is your issue either, 12 Ohms is a very normal amount for a low voltage rail supplying power to a CPU.

They are absent but they should be because the computer is not on, right?\n\nPP3V3_S5 is present\nPP18V5_S3 is not\n\nSMC must be on bc of charger light right?\n\nI'm following along with the video \" [h=1]2009 Unibody Macbook Pro 17\" dead out of nowhere; but why?\"[\/h] I think my assumption that PP5V_S3 should be off and therefore is not worth looking into may have been faulty.  I'm going to investigate whether PP5V_S3 is being told to turn on.  Checking first the [B]beginning [\/B]of the circuit and the [B]end[\/B] of the circuit.\n\nLooking at U7201 enable and buck converter.  \n\nU7201 TPS51125 master enable input EN0 is pin 13: [I]Master enable input. Open : LDOs on, and ready to turn on VCLK and switcher channels. EN0 13 I\/O 620 k\u2126 to GND : enable both LDOs, VCLK off and ready to turn on switcher channels. Power consumption is almost the same as the case of VCLK = ON. GND : disable all circuit[\/I]\n\nENTRIP1 is pin 1 and ENTRIP2 is pin 6: [I]Channel 1 and Channel 2 enable and OCL trip setting pins.Connect resistor from this pin to GND to set I\/O threshold for synchronous RDS(on) sense. Short to ground to shutdown a switcher channel.[\/I]\n\nLeft side is channel 1.  Looking for ENTRIP1 > P5VS3_EN > PM_SLP_S4_L\n\nIn Louis's video, PM_SLP_S4_L is created by MCP79 U1400 (he's on a 2009, mine is 2010).  He checks if the MCP has power to turn on.  He checks PP1V05_S5_MCP.\n\nIn my 2010 model, PM_SLP_S4_L comes from U1800 (the GPU).  I am not sure which signal tells the GPU to turn on.  In my schematic, there is also no PP1V05_S5_MCP.  My schematic references MCP79, but there is no chip with such label.  My boardview does not have a U1400.\n\nSo...is the fact that my GPU U1800 is not outputting PM_SLP_S4_L at least partially the culprit here?  I'm not sure what to do next any suggestions welcome thank you!"}
