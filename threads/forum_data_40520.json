Looking for ENTRIP1 > <SIGNAL>P5VS3_EN</SIGNAL> > <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>\n\nIn Louis's video, <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> is created by MCP79 <CHIP>U1400</CHIP> (he's on a 2009, mine is 2010).  He checks if the MCP has power to turn on.  He checks <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S5_MCP</SIGNAL>.\n\nIn my 2010 model, <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> comes from <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> (the GPU).  I am not sure which signal tells the GPU to turn on.  In my schematic, there is also no <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S5_MCP</SIGNAL>.  My schematic references MCP79, but there is no chip with such label.  My boardview does not have a <CHIP>U1400</CHIP>.\n\nSo...is the fact that my GPU <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> is not outputting <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> at least partially the culprit here?
