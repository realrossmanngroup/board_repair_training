Removed u9850 and short gone. \nCleaned up j8500 and check for continuity between ground and 1\/3 then replaced u9850 and verified short was gone. Even connected lcd cable and checked other end for short on pins 1\/3. \nDifferent disp, new lcd cable and still nothing. Now no burn but pin 3 is shorted again. \n\nShould I replace j8500? Could something else be popping u9850? I'm running out of u9850s."
