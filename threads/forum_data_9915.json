I checked the power rails and found out that the PPBUS_G3H is showing .OL on the multimeter.  Now here is what I did.  I measured every component where PPBUS_G3H should be present, and it measured as .OL.  I understand that .OL means short to ground.  Am I correct in saying that ?  How do I troubleshoot it further and make the computer work.  Please advice.  Raj."}

I go to the board view by Landrex and under \"Net\" put in PPBUS_G3H, where the board view software point out all the components that has PPBUS_G3H.  I put my black probe on the ground and the RED probe on the component that shows PPBUS_G3H.  For eg. the board view software pointed on on C3080 and R3080 as one of the few components and C3080 it says there is PPBUS_G3H where i put the RED probe on the Pin 1 and the multimeter reads .OL.

You are just guessing randomly and there is no logic here at all, or even basic common sense.\n\nFixing boards is learning to use logic, and combining that logic with tools to measure and rule out possible failures to arrive at the most likely failure. You need to learn analytical reasoning, then you need to really understand the tools and how to use them.\n\nOne of the core things that everyone who has ever diagnosed and fixed a board have in common is the ability to recognize when something doesn't make sense, and then go attempt to figure out why.\nHave you ever, on this or any other forum, EVER heard anyone reporting any voltage as \"OL\"? Neither have I. This is like someone asking \"How fast is your car going?\" And you say \"24 centimeters\"\nThis MUST jump out at you as totally wrong, if not, we can't help you. If you recognize that OL doesn't make sense for a voltage reading, logic says you ask yourself \"How do I set my multimeter up to read voltage, have I done it wrong?\" Then you read about your multimeter. You come up with a test--something that does have a voltage, like an AA battery, and you use your multimeter to measure that just to see if it gives the 1.5v answer that it should. If it does not, then study your multimeter until you figure out how to set it to read 1.5v when you put the probes on either side of a battery. If you can't, then you go to the hardware store and find one that does this simple task.\n\nNo one can help you grow in your ability to understand things for yourself if you can't be trusted to post accurate answers to the most basic multimeter questions.\nIf you say \"Yes I have 3.42 volts\" on one rail, but \"OL\" on another rail---showing that you don't know how to take a voltage reading, AND that you are not capable of recognizing this and figuring out on your own how to get your tools to work---then that means that our analytical reasoning of \"Can we solve the problem of teaching Raj to fix boards\" is going to look like this.\n\"Have you explained to Raj how to take a multimeter reading?\"\nYes\n\"Does he remember this?\"\n\"Not really\"\n\"Does he at least recognize that his readings don't make sense and something is wrong with his multimeter?\"\n\"No. Someone has to point it out to him.\"\n\"When someone points it out is he able to understand\"\n\"I think so, but I doubt he will remember in a month\"\n\"Ok, then it is 90% likely that Raj will never be able to fix boards and everyone answering his questions are wasting their time.\"\n\nYou are dangerously close to alienating everyone here who is willing to help you learn this.  \n\nFrom my perspective, I think you owe the group some ANSWERS instead of QUESTIONS in order to restore faith in the hope of others that you are in fact teachable.\nI posted a Homework question for you in PBRS group which you didn't answer.   So here are some more.\n\nHomework #1 Complete three pages of a game of Sudoku. It is a simple game of logic. Your primary difficulty is in mastering the basic skill of analytical reasoning.  When it doesn't come naturally, you have to work on it. Here's a link. [url]http:\/\/www.websudoku.com\/[\/url]\n\nHomework #2 Explain for me what the heck is the difference between computer \"sleep states\"  You HAVE to figure this out YOURSELF from the resources at your fingertips--Louis's videos and the internet.\n\nAnswer these correctly and I bet you can inspire Duke or Louis to stop automatically sending your messages to trash for a few days.\n1.) Is a rail labeled s5 the same as s0?  \n2.) Do they come on at the same time?  \n3.) Does one generate the other?  i.e Do s4 rails come from s3 rails or s5 rails?\n4.) Which would be more important to troubleshoot first---a missing s4 rail or a missing s0 rail?\n\nKeep in mind that I have never fixed a MacBook beyond the most basic obvious problems, so my knowledge base of MacBook board problems is pretty limited.  If even I know what sleep states are---then this means it is BASIC STUFF.  You need to know this.  You've already been to training.  It should ring a bell somewhere in that noggin.  Look it up and figure this out and how it might be relevant to your problem.\n\nCome back when you have done your homework.\nJessa"}
