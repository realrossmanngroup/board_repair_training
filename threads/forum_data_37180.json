Macbook air is trash but I have another one 2012 and I took ssd from broken one and put it to the working one. Blonking folder\nSo I started the working one with usb drive and now I can access to the ssd with the data but in the utilitys disk I can see only the Device, not the partition as it should be.\nAfter diskutil disk I can see that for external disk I have Apple_HFS_ Macintosh SSD and for the internal ssd I want to save data I have: a long string with numbers and letters. \nWhat could be the problem here?"}
