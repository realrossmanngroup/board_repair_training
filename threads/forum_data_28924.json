Am i fucked?","user_id":1190,"username":"Gmorb","post_date":"2017-12-06 00:27:46","message":"Was working on a macbook air with water damage all over the led driver side. Replaced almost every component and led driver. Now upon doing so 2 pads ripped off no big deal beacause those pads were on the outer row of led driver pads. Installed led driver mac booted and i got a backlight but it was flickering like crazy. Inspected my led driver soldering job and noticed it wasnt on straight. I proceeded to adjust it and while doing so the chip flew off and 2 pads in the middle of the where the led driver sit ripped off! Tp fault and one directly next to it.\n\ntried running a wire but even if successful tp fault it gone and i believe theres nothing else that powers it. My question is, has anyone here succeded after this happening to them? What alternatives can i take. Should i flip the chip over and solder wires all over the place? Lol"}
