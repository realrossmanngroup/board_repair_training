I've had a look under the microscope and there is no sign of any liquid damage to any of the components. It's been ultrasonic cleaned and after probing around I've noticed that all the AWAKE and SLPS2R rails are pulsing. These all come from the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>. I'm getting a stable 3.3v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_PMU_VDDMAIN</SIGNAL> and PPBUS is also stable 12.27v.\n\nAm I correct in saying that the <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> is faulty or is there anything else that it could be or I could check.\n\nThank you in advance"
