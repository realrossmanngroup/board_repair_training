When it came in it would get orange light on charger but board only draw 0.14 amps from power supply with or without battery.\n\nAfter replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR> <CAPACITOR>C7571</CAPACITOR> <CAPACITOR>C7116</CAPACITOR> and <RESISTOR>R7116</RESISTOR> the board draws 2.9amps with battery plugged in and only 0.14 without plugged in. Battery is supposedly new. Heatsink gets very warm after few minutes with battery and charger connected but no fan spin.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.56v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.42v\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.33v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> 5.5V\n\nCould this be bad battery or fan?"
