Sorry, just looked at what I wrote again and it does come over like I didn't know that but fear not, i'm only actually half moron :)\nI do at least have it spinning up now but no chime and no backlight or image so I'll deal with that next. The problem was (and always is from this place) some F* div tech does not fix the problem and adds to it by soldering the wrong value resistors decades above or below what is ment to be there so I end up spending ages removing mistakes.\n\nThey all come from a \"refurb center\" that seems to do more DE-furb than refurb"
