But internal ssd not detected, so im sure not an apfs problem.\nU3740 has proper voltage 3v at pin 1 3 4 6\n1v at pin 2\n0 volt at pin 7 and 8 with ssd connected.. \nI have tried replacing all caps at pcie data line, no shorted caps\n0v on pp3v3_s0sw_ssd_flt with ssd connected, I have tried replacing u3710 and u3711..
