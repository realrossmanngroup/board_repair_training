The supplied BIOS has room for 11 character SN, where's the SN I have for this machine is 12 characters; so where do I factor in the extra byte? I can expand the whole section of the file and removing two of the zero-bytes immediately following the ssn section (2 bytes, one for the SN, another for the 4-byte ending between .hwc and .son ), or overwrite one of the bytes either prefixing or suffixing.\n\n\nIf I was to guess, I'd almost say pushing the section in to the zero byte area following would be the correct functional option.\n\nAnyone experienced this?[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59955[/ATTACH]"

Unfortunately the mainboard was dead (PCH) as such I was not able to boot to confirm the SN.\n\nJust realised now I can take the chip from the dead mainboard (BIOS) read it, and check internally.\n\nFor the record, the adding of two bytes and removing two of the zero bytes did result in a readable UEFI structure and was able to generate a correct checksum."
