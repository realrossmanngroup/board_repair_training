[URL='https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/6w67nZr']Took these photos[\/URL] before putting the board through an ultrasonic cleaner with sweepable frequency as per Louis's videos and dried it overnight. It's now pulling 7mA from the power supply. So far I've followed power from the charger and found that power gets all the way to U7090 and PP3V42_G3H is present with 3.42v just past this chip. I checked 3 more spots of PP3V42_G3H across the board and I got 3.42v at each spot. Seeing as there isn't a magsafe light and there is PP3V42_G3H I'm a little confused of what I should check next."}
