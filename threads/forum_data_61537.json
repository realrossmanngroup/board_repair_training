        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",

[URL='https://imgur.com/a/6w67nZr']Took these photos[/URL] before putting the board through an ultrasonic cleaner with sweepable frequency as per Louis's videos and dried it overnight. It's now pulling 7mA from the power supply. So far I've followed power from the charger and found that power gets all the way to <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is present with 3.42v just past this chip. I checked 3 more spots of <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> across the board and I got 3.42v at each spot. Seeing as there isn't a magsafe light and there is <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> I'm a little confused of what I should check next."
