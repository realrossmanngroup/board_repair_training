        "message":"I have a Macbook (820-3115) that came in \"dead\" and the customer states that a \"whole bottle of water is in there.\"\n\nIt does not turn on, no chimes, no fan, nothing.\nBattery LED meter on the side shows the battery at about 50%.\nMagSafe gives me a green light but never changes to orange (always green).\n\nUp until now the extent of my diagnostic skills have been limited to obvious things - in this case I would have thought there would be obvious water damage on the board.\nThere is no apparent water damage on the board. The only bit of green-rust\/oxide build up that I could find was very small amount on C5856 cap near the key board light connector which really was not a problem at all.\n\nI have read through the Beginners presentation power point and tried to check some things based on what I read there but the truth is, I don't yet know exactly what I am doing and I think I am just chasing a rabbit I will never catch without some guidance here.\nI can tell you there is power in various places... initially I thought maybe a water spill caused some problems with the keyboard and power switch so I tried turning it on using the Power On pads (there is 3.45V on one pad) but it does not turn on.\n\nI have the board out of the laptop and would appreciate any help I can get on where should I really start?\nI should add... I do not have a working board to compare with."

There is slight evidence that water was around this chip (rust like discoloration) and I am wondering if it caused some problems within.\n\nI ordered some chips and figured I could change it anyway which brings me to the next question... I have never removed a buck converter. I see it has a ground solder underneath but I am wondering if there is any type of adhesive as well. Are there any tips for removing this?\nThanks\n\n\nEdit: I just now realized that TPS51125 is the U7200 buck!"
