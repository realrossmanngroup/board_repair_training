The only bit of green-rust/oxide build up that I could find was very small amount on <CAPACITOR>C5856</CAPACITOR> cap near the key board light connector which really was not a problem at all.\n\nI have read through the Beginners presentation power point and tried to check some things based on what I read there but the truth is, I don't yet know exactly what I am doing and I think I am just chasing a rabbit I will never catch without some guidance here.\nI can tell you there is power in various places... initially I thought maybe a water spill caused some problems with the keyboard and power switch so I tried turning it on using the Power On pads (there is 3.45V on one pad) but it does not turn on.\n\nI have the board out of the laptop and would appreciate any help I can get on where should I really start?\nI should add... I do not have a working board to compare with."

There is slight evidence that water was around this chip (rust like discoloration) and I am wondering if it caused some problems within.\n\nI ordered some chips and figured I could change it anyway which brings me to the next question... I have never removed a buck converter. I see it has a ground solder underneath but I am wondering if there is any type of adhesive as well. Are there any tips for removing this?\nThanks\n\n\nEdit: I just now realized that <CHIP>TPS51125</CHIP> is the <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> buck!"
