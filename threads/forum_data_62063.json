Left ports were replaced.\nThe left USB-C ports do not communicate USB data but [U]do charg[\/U]e the unit.\n\nNone of the zener diodes are damaged on the data lines and the fault covers both left ports.\nLooking at the schematics I see U2800 is on this channel as well as both the CD3217's\n\nLooks SOC U3900 \"T2\" is also in the mix here.\n\nWhere do I start?"
