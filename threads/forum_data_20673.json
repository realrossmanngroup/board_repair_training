        "message":"Working on an 820-3330 board that has green light, but no power. No liquid involved. Using genuine 85W charger.\n\n- All main rails present (5v_s5, 3v3_s5, ppbus, 3v42)\n- Nothing gets warm, no shorts detected.\n- PPVRTC_G3H present\n- PM_DSW_PWRGD present\n- PM_SLP_SUS_L present, but PP5v_SUS and PP3v3_SUS both missing.\n\n- Q7820: my gate (pin 3) is 3.3v, and my source (pin 4) is 3.34v, but my drain (pin 1) is 0v.\n- Q7840: my gate (pin 3) is 4.92v, and my source (pin 4) is 5.02v, but my drain (pin 1) is 0v.\n\nAre these two MOSFETs bad? My gate is lower than the source on both, but the drain on each is 0v. If I'm on the wrong track, please just let me know. Since I've got PM_SLP_SUS_L, but not PM_SLP_S5_L, and I'm missing 5v_sus\/3v3_sus, I'd assume this is where my issue is.\n\nAny help appreciated!"

However, Something killed them. Bad controller most likely and the controller most likely took out all the fets in that circuit as well. Replace the TPS51980 and replace the FETs in that circuit and see if it fixes it."
