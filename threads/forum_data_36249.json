The fan only spins on this model when the CPU gets warm. Not an issue just a stupid feature.\n2. The ONLY LCD that will work with the 4924 is a 2015 13\" display. 2013\/14 will have picture with no backlight. Must be the 2015 screen. \n3. Keyboard backlight I have no idea. Tried another keyboard backlight?"}

Pin 1 on the connector or cable is probably damaged. Could also be inside the LCD but that is more rare. Inspect connector and cable first."}
