        "message":"Customer said MacBook would not turn on. I verified this by connecting charger and Mac was only accepting 5.1V at 0.24A on three of the four ports. The last port was doing nothing at all. I removed board and PP3V3_G3H was only 2.6V and UB300 had a small hole through it. I removed and replaced this chip and repaired one of the broken traces for PPDCIN_G3H connected to this CD3215 chip. Here are the requested readings after this work was done:\n\nDiode:\nR6915 = 0.370V\nC6905 = 0.578V\n\nU6905 Voltages:\nPin 2= 4.60V\nPin 10 = 4.986V\nPin 1 = 7.30V\nPin 3 = 2.80V\nPin 9 = 0.772V\n\nThanks in advance"
