Even Ubuntu has got it right. \nThe very moment it goes to OS login screen both keyboard and trackpad are disabled. \n\nThings I have tried\n\n*New KB Flex\n*New Trackpad and Flex\n*Inspecting for corrosion and any damaged joints. \n\nVoltages are present as you can feel the trackpad clicking too. \n\nSeems like mid boot that the caps key stops lightig up. \n\nAnyone experienced this before and literally any advice would be greatly appreciated?"}
