It got water damage and I got if for free from work to play around with.\nI've watched many of Louises videos and I'm very interested to learn board repair as a hobby.\n\nI get a green light (turns orange after a couple seconds) when connecting power. If I put my multimeter to VDC and measure <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> on F7140 it fluctuate from 3.2V to 11-12V with 5 seconds-isch between the highs and lows.\n\nIf I put it in diode mode (with no power to the board) and put the red probe on ground and black on F7140 I get 132 on the multimeter on both sides of the fuse.\nI measured the same on F7700 and got 127 on both sides. I don't know if this is to any help since I don't have a know good value for this.\n\nWhat can make it fluctuate like that? I've never heard Louise mention anything like that in the videos I've watched.\nOr is it my multimeter? It's a cheap ass multimeter for like $15 that I borrowed from my step dad."
