        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

SPI_MLBROM_CS_L is a signal that goes between the SPI ROM chip and another chip on machines with quad SPI, that can frequently corrode on 13” Macbook Air from 2015 because it is near the corner where liquid seeps in.
