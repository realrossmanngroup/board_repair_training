            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, history is weird, however came to me with dent in charger port, and it looks like some charger port water damage too. Owner said she brought it to apple and they diagnosed it as a bad logic board. Board will boot in safe mode on its own sometimes, and fans will spin to max.\n\nWhen I first got the board, the magsafe light was not present. Replaced DC-In board and cable, now we have light showing however power button does not work.\n\nI thought it was keyboard/trackpad related, however I can confirm it isnt. Shorting <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL> does nothing, no reaction. Manual rst works. Strange thing is also when booted into macOS, and when the display lid is closed, display will turn off and go to sleep, however when opening again it will not trigger any reaction to <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL>, will check when and if <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is present or not.\n\nAny clues or other needed info?"
