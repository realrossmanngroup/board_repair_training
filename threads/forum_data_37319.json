        "message":"got a 3330 with 10.5v on both sides of the backlight fuse. the screen makes a little difference in lighting when powering on and off but the backlight does not come on. i can see the options menu when i put a light up to it. tried a different test screen and same thing. swapped out u9701 and have 3.3v on blk_en and 3.5v on PWM, do you think this could be the gpu?"
