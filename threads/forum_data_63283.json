Ive verified every power and enable signal related to SSD i can think of, and everything seems normal. Seem to be getting PWRGOODs on everything SSD related as well.   That said, happy to provide specific measurements if i happened to miss something.  \n\nThe only thing that is anomalous is the lack of the 100MHZ SSD clock signals.   the clock request is low (.090v which is a not zero, but i think would still count as a logic low).\nJ9600 cover is present ( and replaced for testing sake). I have only been able to look for those clocks with the j9600 cover removed as i dont see any other place to measure it. Will SSD clock be present with the cover removed? Is there anywhere to measure for it on the board otherwise?\n\n\n\nNo evidence of liquid damage. It did have a Drivesavers sticker on it, so it is possible they cleaned it, but it looks very clean everywhere.\nAssuming i am on the right path of the missing clock signal, is there anything other than the CPU that could be causing this? It looks like the request goes low, and the cpu should start spitting out 100MHZ, with only traces in between the CPU and j9600. \n\nContinuity on j9600 seems good\n\nWifi works fine, so the cpu must be putting out the AP clock (if i understand that correctly anyway).  Camera did not work in Linux, but that doesnt say much. Doing a Mac OS USB install presently to test that.      I am leaning towards a bad connection from CPU ball to board, but it seems unlikely to have those connections be bad while absolutely everything else is working.\n\nSSD not present in linux, SSD not present in Mac OS Disk Utility.   Mac OS online diagnostics come back as no issues found."
