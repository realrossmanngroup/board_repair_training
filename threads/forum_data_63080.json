        "message":"Hi all, Im new to the forum and trying to learn to repair macbooks.. :)\nI got this macbook air with the trackpad click not working, the fuse was blown (its never the fuse) I tested the line and seems ok, replaced the fuse and it worked again... all good BUT when I tried to remove the board again I pressed the reset switch next to the battery connector WITH the USB-C power still connected to the board.... I pressed and kept pressed for some seconds twice because the fan started to spin... then I realized why.... After that the machine wont boot, It gets 20V and start booting it goes briefly until 0.5A the returns to 0.45A and stays there, after some seconds it restarts the boot process again, I dont get anything on the screen. the CPU start to get warm and fan starts spining...\nThe switch SW6955 still gets 3.3V\nAll the SLPS2R are with te correct voltage.\nPVDDCPUAWAKE_SW0 to SW3 when booting 0.97V then goes to 0.55V and stays there\n\nPP1v2_S0SW: 1.19V\n\nPP1v_S0SW: 1V\n\nPPVCCIO_S0_CPU: 0.95V\n\nPPVCCSA_S0_CPU: 1.1V\n\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU: 0.84V\n\nPPVCCGT_S0_CPU: 0V\n\nALL_SYSPWRGD: 1.8V\n\nTrackpad click still works, no green light on keyboard, if I connect an usb to the usbc it  gets  light for a second\n\nThank you in advance\n\n[MEDIA=youtube]WXGKFKMpVz0[\/MEDIA]"
