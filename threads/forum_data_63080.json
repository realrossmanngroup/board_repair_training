I pressed and kept pressed for some seconds twice because the fan started to spin... then I realized why.... After that the machine wont boot, It gets 20V and start booting it goes briefly until 0.5A the returns to 0.45A and stays there, after some seconds it restarts the boot process again, I dont get anything on the screen. the CPU start to get warm and fan starts spining...\nThe switch SW6955 still gets 3.3V\nAll the SLPS2R are with te correct voltage.\nPVDDCPUAWAKE_SW0 to SW3 when booting 0.97V then goes to 0.55V and stays there\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S0SW</SIGNAL>: 1.19V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V_S0SW</SIGNAL>: 1V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCIO_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>: 0.95V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCSA_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>: 1.1V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>: 0.84V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>: 0V\n\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYSPWRGD</SIGNAL>: 1.8V\n\nTrackpad click still works, no green light on keyboard, if I connect an usb to the usbc it  gets  light for a second\n\nThank you in advance\n\n[MEDIA=youtube]WXGKFKMpVz0[/MEDIA]"
