When entering boot menu, the image on the screen distorted once and the computer restarted (just like when I entered the password to enter the user). Could this change the assumption of the faulty IGPU? \n\n2. I got the ASD OS 3S148, but its been loading for 20 minutes and nothing happen (apple logo with loading circle).\nThis is the a  MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2011) built in the second half of 2011 with 2915 board. Is that the correct ASD?\n\n\n3. I am seriosly considering replacing the CPU on this, good possibily of the being the a CPU issue? \n\n\nThanks"
