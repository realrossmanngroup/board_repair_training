        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "CHGR_CSO_N": "What is CHGR_CSO_N? CHGR_CSO_N is one of the current sense lines for the battery. Resistance between CHGR_CSO_N and CHGR_CSO_P should be the resistance should be the total series resistance of the current sense resistors in the circuit, usually about 2.2 ohms.",
        "CHGR_CSO_P": "What is CHGR_CSO_P? CHGR_CSO_P is one of the current sense lines for the battery. Resistance between CHGR_CSO_P and CHGR_CSO_N should be the resistance should be the total series resistance of the current sense resistors in the circuit, usually about 2.2 ohms.",

        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this lineâ€™s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system.."

It looks like my SMC is fried. My diode mode reading on <SIGNAL>CHGR_CSO_N</SIGNAL> - 0.134 & <SIGNAL>CHGR_CSO_P</SIGNAL> - 0.135. I already try replacing it but im still having the same problem. <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> has already been replaced as well. any suggestions?"
