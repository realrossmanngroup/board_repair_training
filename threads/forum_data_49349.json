        "message":"Hi,\n\nI have that board which was previously fixed in another store for liquid damage.\nRepair was done around backlight circuitry and that one works.\nSMC was also reflowed.\n\nI know that sensor is on the I\/O board so I've tried with a different I\/O board and same issue.\nI've tried a known good board in the case and everything works as expected.\n\nI went ahead and did replaced the SMC but in the end, same issue.\n\nI don't have the schematic for that I\/O board and I am not asking for it... ;-)\nHowever can someone tells me which line that sensor speaks to the SMC on so I can do a diode mode measurement and check for continuity from the connector the nearest point near SMC?\n\nThanks!"
