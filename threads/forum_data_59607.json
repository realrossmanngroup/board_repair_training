Replaced SSD connector, turned on and off few times to test it and it was booting all fine, so decided to test fully with connected trackpad keyboard and speakers, after putting board back to housing it was coming on with question mark again.. And on top of that when i tried to boot to mac os x pendrive smoked (but not sure if the problem is new USB C to USB Adapter).\n<SIGNAL>SSD_PWR_EN_L</SIGNAL> Missing\n<RESISTOR>R8640</RESISTOR> - 68K instead of 100K\n<RESISTOR>R8645</RESISTOR> - 20K instead of 100K\n<RESISTOR>R8620</RESISTOR> - 94K instead of 470K\nAll caps connecting with <CHIP>U8640</CHIP> looks good.\n\nAny ideas where to have a look? :rolleyes:.

But usb c adapter works still fine, board kills whatever is connected to it and has IC's (maybe instead of 5V it gives all around 20V?). Yes, I tried another one usb c adapter and different flash drive, same results (another one burned flash drive). Looks like It also kills ssd's connected to board.
