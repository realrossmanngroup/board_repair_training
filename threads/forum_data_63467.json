        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",
        "R1802": "What is R1802? a RESISTOR.",
        "C1802": "What is C1802? Capacitor to ground on PCH_SRTCRST_L on machines from 2009-2012, PCH_SRTCRST_L needs to be high for PCH to not be in RTC reset mode, this capacitor can become corroded or leaky and result in this signal being pulled low. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",

        "PCH_INTVRMEN": "What is PCH_INTVRMEN? PCH_INTVRMEN is an Internal Voltage Regulator Enable: When pulled high, this signal enables\nthe internal 1.05 V regulators for the Suspend well in the PCH. This signal must\nremain asserted for the VRMs to behave properly (no glitches allowed).\nThis signal must be pulled-up to VCCRTC on desktop platforms and may\noptionally be pulled low on mobile platforms if using an external VR for the\nVCCSUS rail.",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",

        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",

She went to Apple, they said it's dead...need to buy a new one.\n\nI remove the screen, I can see led 1 on. I tried to bypass power button, doesn't help, SMC reset, doesn't help.I unplugged all cables from motherboard except the power, I took card out, I remove the BR2032, plug power... it starts.\n\n\nI did some test without BR2032 and screen, everytime I plug power cord, it's start.\n\nI've measuer BR2032, it's not perfect but still green. I remove it and user another one. I plug everything back. iMac starts (FAN full speed always), I login, setup wifi... and then I shut it down properly. After shutdown, iMac doesnt start. I always need to remove the BR2032 to make it working again, not very convinent.\n\nLast I tried yesterday night, I tried with a CR2023 (just to try), it starts, (FAn were not always on) I tought it was ok... but no.. same. I shut it down and then it doesn't start again.\n\n\nI've tried to disconnect Camera as mentionned in other post, it doesn't help. I've tried to unplug cable after cable and try to power it each time, doesn't work. It only start when I remove the BR2032. If I don't place a BR2032, same behavior, it starts but won't boot again If I shut down properly. If I remove power cord when login screen is displayed, it will start... It doesn't like proper shut down...\n\n\nBasically, with not BR2032 installed, if I shut down iMac properly ( from login screen, I don't need to login to test this behavior) it doesn't turn on after. I need to unplug power cord and then it will start again.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nSam"
