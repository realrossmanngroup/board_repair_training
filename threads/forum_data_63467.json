She's not using it a lot. Last week, she wanted to turn it on... no sign of life. She went to Apple, they said it's dead...need to buy a new one.\n\nI remove the screen, I can see led 1 on. I tried to bypass power button, doesn't help, SMC reset, doesn't help.I unplugged all cables from motherboard except the power, I took card out, I remove the BR2032, plug power... it starts.\n\n\nI did some test without BR2032 and screen, everytime I plug power cord, it's start.\n\nI've measuer BR2032, it's not perfect but still green. I remove it and user another one. I plug everything back. iMac starts (FAN full speed always), I login, setup wifi... and then I shut it down properly. After shutdown, iMac doesnt start. I always need to remove the BR2032 to make it working again, not very convinent.\n\nLast I tried yesterday night, I tried with a CR2023 (just to try), it starts, (FAn were not always on) I tought it was ok... but no.. same. I shut it down and then it doesn't start again.\n\n\nI've tried to disconnect Camera as mentionned in other post, it doesn't help. I've tried to unplug cable after cable and try to power it each time, doesn't work. It only start when I remove the BR2032. If I don't place a BR2032, same behavior, it starts but won't boot again If I shut down properly. If I remove power cord when login screen is displayed, it will start... It doesn't like proper shut down...\n\n\nBasically, with not BR2032 installed, if I shut down iMac properly ( from login screen, I don't need to login to test this behavior) it doesn't turn on after. I need to unplug power cord and then it will start again.\n\n\n\nThanks\n\nSam"}

I did read the post before but I didn't solder wire, maybe I should have started with that instead of tweezer. Now I've solder a wire, when I connect to GND quickly, PM_PWRBTN_L drop to 0.3 and iMac boot. I've placed B2032 back. iMac is working correctly. Thank you for your help."}
