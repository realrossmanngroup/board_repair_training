        "message":"Hi all! First I'm glad I'm now part of this forum. The issue is with an 820-00281 board here. Initially it was not turning on. I figured out that the battery was bad and C4403 was shorted to GND. I replaced that cap and the board turned on without battery. I ordered a new battery and installed it on the machine. Now the machine boots, charges battery and works like a charm, but whenever I try to put it to sleep or try to turn it off it gives me a Kernel Panic related to ACPI. I am new to Touchbars and have worked on only a few boards of this kind and am completely lost without any ideas on where to start troubleshooting this issue. If anyone have ever seen something like this before it would be great help! PS.: I already tried to test without battery and with an original battery(another machine of the same kind arrived here) and the issue persists! Kernel Panic on ACPI everytime when trying to shutdown or sleep."
