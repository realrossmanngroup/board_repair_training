Issue is when charger is plugged in it will act as though its being plugged in and out every few seconds. PPBUS_G3H voltage with charger and battery 11.15V. 11.50v with battery alone.\n\n12.65v with charger alone but only low battery symbol appears on the screen.\n\nReplaced ISL9239 and C7020 since ohm reading was OL. No changes. R7030\/40 appear to be good. Q7065 is not shorted.\n\nWhat to try next?"}
