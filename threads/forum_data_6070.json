My hope was the problem was related as the GPU was going south, but it seems the problem isn't that. Now once I get it to boot if there are ANY video probs, I will try to take it to the apple store, but I live in Hong Kong, China, a place that is not known for having any customer service at all. I would be blown away if anyone at apple would help me."
