There was an image for a split second when opened the Lid ? then black. Restarting, pulling battery ? doesn?t help. Later tried to shine flashlight through the Logo, but was too late. By ?late? I mean after disconnecting battery 3-4 times (with nylon opening tool) now on Start laptop Chimes, cuts off Chime in the middle, restarts, Chimes, cuts off chime in the middle, restarts, Chimes, cuts off? loop.\nRemembered have Same laptop with broken LCD. Great. Swap motherboard. Did. Laptop worked for a while until I connected battery ? now second board has same issue. Suspect battery-killer, but still need to fix (now two) boards. Now will use battery from second machine.\nAlso CPU fan doesn?t spin anymore.\n\nHave heard Louis mentioned <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> in his videos like a gozillion times so got multimeter.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> ? 12.4V (15.84 kOhm line resistance)\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> ? 3.3V\n\nPlease help to figure out."

Did the trick for me just now. 50% of all display issues with 4924 are display cable. Easy to swap and test.  Many people replace the display while it is only the cable, did that for 2 years so I have a nice stock of working displays now ;)"

Problem started in #1. #2 I just happen to have with broken screen. So after testing lines (with your help) I suspect the culprit to be battery #1 (which you told me NOT to connect any more) so I am testing macbook #1 with battery #2. So far it is working. Tomorrow will play a non stop movies on youtube to see if macbook survives with charger plugged in and without.\nThank you very much for your help. Hope to have new questions for you soon.\nSay Hi to Louis please."
