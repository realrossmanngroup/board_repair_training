        "820-00164": "What is 820-00164? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. ."

Some times when you plug it in some times it works  some times it does not.   \"most of the time not\"\nI watch it on the scope and when not working the voltage never comes up and there is no data.   When working totally normal including the after chatter.\n\nHere is the fun part.   I have replaced the SMC / DC-IN and Ribbon are my testers so they are definitely good.\nI diode checked and ohmed out the <SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> and compared it to a working LB and it is exactly the same.  I have also resoldered J9500 \"which was perfect without water damage\" and verified it is solid.\n\nLB will function properly off a power supply driven cord that does not need the <SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> signal to turn on power.\nI am kind of thinking the only thing left is a damaged line inside the board and I would have to run a jumper under the SMC but I am like \"no... way....\" !\n\n\nIdeas?"
