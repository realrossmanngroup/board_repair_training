        "message":"I seem to a pile of insane faults.\nI got a nasty 820-4924 in, Did allot to get it posting, and then found it wouldnt display or boot if the trackpad cable was plugged in, It just seems to sit with backlight on but nothing else.\n\nTried known good parts, inspected the board, Brushed U4830 and it was that corroded it fell off the board. \nFixed the damage replacing U4830 and U4820 for good measure, and fixed all the damaged traces and Via's around the area. checked diode mode in  most areas. However the fault still remains.\n\nNow for the strange part. If i hotplug the trackpad after post it all works fine, displays, boots and the trackpad  and keyboard work perfectly.\nIve put a good couple of hours into this one now and im starting to loose my mind."

When the TPAD is plugged in R4913 is lower than a known good (2.4V rather than 3v3)\n\nWhen hotplugged straight after post all works well, and the Trackpad hardware is recognised under the SPI section of system report. Im really struggling to understand why this board will not work! :("
