            "message": "Hello. I have a 17\" 2009 Macbook Pro (logic board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2610</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> I believe). For the past few years it was having trouble starting up and then it would shut off quickly. Occasionally it would boot completely and then it would work fine for days. A few months ago it stopped starting up completely. I read on a forum about how this could be due to the infamous <CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR> capacitor. I followed the heat test and put it on the radiator. The computer then booted up, so I then got a few of this capacitor: 330 uf 1362J - d\n\n[URL]https://www.mobilesentrix.ca/capacitor-ic-for-macbook-pro-unibody-13-15-17-<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>-<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1286</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>-1297-<CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR>-330uf-2v-b2-sm[/URL]\n\nInitially I installed the capacitor after moving the 2R2 L7770 coil to make room for it. When I was removing the original tantalum capacitor I tried moving it before it was hot enough and partially detached the + lead pad on the logic board. I tried smoothing over the *partial* break with solder. The replacement cap measured got a 0.3 volt reading with the multimeter, which obviously wasn't good. \n\nTrying again I wanted to make sure that the capacitor was properly attached to the partially damaged pad. I tried attaching another capacitor with wires and then I hooked the negative lead wire to a screw hole (just to try something new), but got the same 0.3 V reading. \n\nIf the new cap is measuring 0.3 V, then maybe that suggests that the original problem wasn't the capacitor, or that there are more problems? I didn't test the tantalum cap because I assumed that it had been the culprit based on the symptoms.\n\nI read on another post that the L7770 2R2 coil should be returning a 1 V reading. I got a 0.1 V reading from it - could I have broken the coil with excessive heat from the hot air rework station? Here are the photos of the repair:\n\n[MEDIA=imgur]a/wNBtyxj[/MEDIA] \n\nAnyone have any ideas as to what could've gone wrong? Thanks."

Would you mind explaining?\n\nJust got some super fine multimeter probe adapters for the small chips and I'm in the process of checking the continuity of the traces in the region, will update when I'm done. So far so good.\n\nCould the 2R2 coil have sustained some damage from taking a lot of the heat from the heat gun? What voltage should the coil itself return so I can check it? Also what should the 2R2928F63 chip at L7510 return? I chipped the corner off when I brushed it with the tweezers (visible in pics) while it was still hot from the heat gun. Did I break it?\n\nThanks again!"
