        "message":"Have a liquid damaged A1398, Replaced the battery and it would boot from the battery. 27% charged when charger was connected it read 100% and charging with no light on the mag-safe. I was trying to test PP3V42_G3H and my shaky hands bridged two  SMDs with my positive lead from my multi-meter. C7102 connected to  C7116. Now I got no power on from battery, and it no longer powers on when I connect the charger. Did I just kill this board? Is U7100 now dead, SMC or is this still fixable?"
