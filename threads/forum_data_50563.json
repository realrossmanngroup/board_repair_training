            "message": "Hello all,\n\nAm attempting to repair this board which has no green light.  It has all the G3H \"always present\" voltage rails except that <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 8.1V.  It is not going past this state and S4 and other voltages from there on out are missing.  I can't see any shorts atm nor do i see an attempt at turning on and then shutting down because of a short.  It just seems dead.  <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is 3.3v and the one wire circuit seems to be okay.  I did have to cross ref the info for the LIO board where the one wire circuit is as I can't find the LIO schematic for this board.\n\nYour help as always, greatly appreciated."
