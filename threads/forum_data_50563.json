It has all the G3H \"always present\" voltage rails except that PPBUS_G3H is 8.1V.  It is not going past this state and S4 and other voltages from there on out are missing.  I can't see any shorts atm nor do i see an attempt at turning on and then shutting down because of a short.  It just seems dead.  SMC_RESET_L is 3.3v and the one wire circuit seems to be okay.  I did have to cross ref the info for the LIO board where the one wire circuit is as I can't find the LIO schematic for this board.\n\nYour help as always, greatly appreciated."}

Customer didnt mention liquid damage and I don't see any corrosion."}

Start by giving the SMC a nice light reflow be sure to remove the edge bonding well. If no change, replace from and identical 820-00165 donor board."}
