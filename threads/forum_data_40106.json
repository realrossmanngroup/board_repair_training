        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

So, based on your last suggestion, even with no signs of life with the USB keyboard light, this has reached the SPI ROM stage? In the meantime I'll start the process of checking all of those traces and resistors."
