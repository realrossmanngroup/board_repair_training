Chimes and boot ok no lag no heat. No water damage, this board is intact.\n\nI decided to run EFI just for the heck of it and found these 3 Temp errors all reading above high limit according to hardware profile:\n\nTemp (TG1H) - Left Heat pipe / Fin Stack Proximity Temp (test 1) / Range [15-80]°C / Reading reported 128.000°C\nTemp (TN0D) - CPU Vcore voltage (test 1) / Range [15-100]°C / Reading reported 128.000°C\nTemp (TN0P) - MCP Proximity (test 1) / Range [15-75]°C / Reading reported 128.000°C\n\nThey all report the same 128.000°C value, should I look only to <CHIP>U5550</CHIP> and <CHIP>U5500</CHIP>?"
