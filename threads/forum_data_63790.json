No signs of liquid exposure or accumulated dust corrosion. \nInitially, it pulled 20v steady but amperage would climb from .2A and within 15-20 seconds make its way to .95A then drop to .01A. Process loops indefinitely.\nKnowing how sensitive these T2's are, I placed it into DFU mode, that held until a revive attempt was made, then it disconnects within 20 seconds w/ error: AMRestoreErrorDomain error 9. \n\nAfter the DFU attempt, the system now alternates between the initial 20vdc to 5.14vdc then back to 20v @ .01A. \n20v stays for 6s and 5.14v for 20s.\n\nSuspecting a NAND/SSD power issue, I checked SSD0 and SSD1 and both measured fine with 2.5v and no short to ground when battery is disconnected.\nWhen battery is connected, it will stay steady @ 2.5v when 20v goes to 5v but right before it goes back to 20v, SSD0 & SSD1 drop to 0v for 3s then returns back to 2.5v.\nNever seen anything like it.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12.6v while pulling 5.14v from USB-C then 12.76v while pulling 20v.\n<SIGNAL>PP0V9_SSD1</SIGNAL> - 0.88v\n<SIGNAL>PP0V9_SSD0</SIGNAL> - 0.88v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> - 5.13v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_G3S</SIGNAL> - 1.79v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_SSD0_SNS</SIGNAL> - 3.38\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> - 12.6v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0.00v\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 2 ohms to ground which I think is normal with these newer CPUs. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.
