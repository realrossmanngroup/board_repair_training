I was able to find to find a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL>. <CAPACITOR>C7324</CAPACITOR> was the culprit. After re-checking my voltages I noticed that I'm only getting 1.03v instead of 8.6v in this line. Any idea what's causing this? Is <CAPACITOR>C7324</CAPACITOR> required to produce 8.6v? I haven't replaced it yet. Thanks for the input\n\nPPBUS G3H 8.57v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> 1.03v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.42v"
