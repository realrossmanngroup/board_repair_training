        "message":"[PLAIN][SOLVED] [820-3437-A] Orange light No fan spin - Getting 1v on PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS[\/PLAIN]\n\nHello everyone, i got a 820-3437 with no power. I was able to find to find a short on PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS. C7324 was the culprit. After re-checking my voltages I noticed that I'm only getting 1.03v instead of 8.6v in this line. Any idea what's causing this? Is C7324 required to produce 8.6v? I haven't replaced it yet. Thanks for the input\n\nPPBUS G3H 8.57v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS 1.03v\nPP3V42_G3H 3.42v"
