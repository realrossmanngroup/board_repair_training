I noticed these resistors are gone.  <RESISTOR>R5116</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5101</RESISTOR>.  I believe this would explain why I cannot reset SMC but do not know.  I looked at schems and do not believe that the lack of these resistors would cause no chime. no boot.  I am looking for advice on best way to check for missing voltage to allow MBA to post.  Any advice appreciated, please.  <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is present 3.3v"

            "message": "I am curious, it appears that many of the Main Logics have the same power circuitry.  Is there a defined efficient way to check in order power rails quickly to determine what exactly is missing?  On <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> on this board after looking at the logic breakdown of the chip and then looking at schematics I noticed many of the power rails were the same throughout the board.  Is there a voltage divider that takes the AC in and splits all these power rails? There has to be some power regulation/creator circuitry that pumps out all needed voltages...  Sadly, Because I am a newb and learning slowly I cannot find this in the schems...  is there test point locations on the board that breaks out these voltages?"
