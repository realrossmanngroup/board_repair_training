            "message": "Hi all.\nLooking at a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01958</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that was extensively water damaged.\nAfter cleaning, I'm only getting 5v on both USBC ports.\n\nWith the AC adaptor connected to the primary (REAR) USBC port: \n<SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_T_VBUS</SIGNAL> 0.00v\n<SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_X_VBUS</SIGNAL> 5.25v\nHowever,\nWith the AC adaptor connected to the secondary (FRONT) USBC port: \n<SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_T_VBUS</SIGNAL> 5.25v\n<SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_X_VBUS</SIGNAL> constantly fluctuating/cycling between 0.00v and about 0.50v\n\nI would normally assume that the fluctuating voltage would indicate a short on <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_X_VBUS</SIGNAL>, however as it shows 5.25v on the other port, it cannot be shorted.\nWould this indicate a problem with the Secondary USBC controller?\n\nI also just noticed that <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> also fluctuates from about 2.98v to 5.05v ONLY when connected to the secondary USBC port.\n\nChecking coils, <SIGNAL>PP1V1_S3</SIGNAL> also seems to be too low. \nIn diode mode, red to ground, it measures 008.\nIn resistance mode it measures 2.3立 to ground.\n\nAny suggestions appreciated, thank you."
