        "820-00239": "What is 820-00239? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PP3V0_G3H": "What is PP3V0_G3H? PP3V0_G3H is a 3.0v power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state..",
        "SLP_SUS": "What is SLP_SUS? a SIGNAL.",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",

Checked inside and all i could find was a bit of dust, literally no signs of liquid damage.\n\nAfter doing a bit of research I tracked down <SIGNAL>RTC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> as a possible culprit. It stays at a stead .3v. So in turn, <SIGNAL>PP3V0_G3H</SIGNAL> is at .3v. Does that mean my SMC is shot? Or possibly the CPU? If I leave it plugged in, every once in a while it will miraculously turn on. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is present, no <SIGNAL>SLP_SUS</SIGNAL> signal, so no <SIGNAL>3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>, and nothing higher after that.\n\nAnything helps."
