No liquid damage, customer says he took it to the beach and it wouldnt power on after a while. Checked inside and all i could find was a bit of dust, literally no signs of liquid damage.\n\nAfter doing a bit of research I tracked down RTC_RESET_L as a possible culprit. It stays at a stead .3v. So in turn, pp3v0_g3h is at .3v. Does that mean my SMC is shot? Or possibly the CPU? If I leave it plugged in, every once in a while it will miraculously turn on. PP3v3_s5 is present, no SLP_SUS signal, so no 3v3_sus, and nothing higher after that.\n\nAnything helps."}

It's dead 90% of the time, but randomly if left on the charger it will turn on. I'm guessing bad cap along 3v0_g3h, but just looking for help. Backing up data right now since it's on before I do anything."}

It's either correct or at .3v, but a steady .3v. I'll try reflow first, then probably track down bad caps if possible.\nIt stays on as long as I don't turn it off, so my guess it's a little cap just charges up eventually and allows 3v0_g3h to work at SOME point."}
