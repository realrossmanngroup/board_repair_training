We've tried disconnecting the touchbar, front camera, updating with a different MacOS and still the same. I read somewhere to check <CHIP>U4200</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> in case of any minor corrosion and these are pristine. \n\nAlso tested the board in a different housing and still the same error.\n\nNot sure where to check next.\n\nJust to add that the Macbook boots in safe mode as expected. \n\nAny pointers would be much appreciated! Thank you"
