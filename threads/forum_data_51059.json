            "message": "Macbook 17\", customer says computer was heating up and randomly shutting down. He went to an Apple partner store, apparently only give a format to the computer and return it to the customer, he is not sure if something else was done to the macbook. As usual they try to sell him a new machine. \nAfter the Macbook was return he didn't have his data in the drive (that's why we think they give a format or reinstall the OS), macbook work fine for a couple of hours, then it start heating, fan spin very loud then it turns of.\nAfter heating up, customer let it rest for 1 day. Next day computer turns on for few minutes and then turn off, after a couple of times macbook stop booting.\n\nNow computer spin the fan for a few seconds and turns off, does this in a loop, if macbook is cold fan spins longer.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 8.4 Volts, not sure what to expect in this line, is my first time working in this model and diagram says \"6V\"\nAll S5 rails are fine\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> up to VCore are pulsating, shows normal voltage for a couple of seconds and then go to 0V. \n\nAny ideas? \nOr should I skip this one?"
