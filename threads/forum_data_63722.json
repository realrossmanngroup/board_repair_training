        "820-00281": "What is 820-00281? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "ISL9239": "What is ISL9239? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2016-2018 responsible for charging the battery and creating the power rail PPBUS_G3H.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PM_EN_P3V3_G3H": "What is PM_EN_P3V3_G3H? PM_EN_P3V3_G3H is a signal that enables the PP3V3_G3H rail to turn on. This comes out of ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip; when missing, often is missing because of a bad ISL9239 or ISL9240 chip. .",
