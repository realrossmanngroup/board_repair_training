        "message":"Hi, I have this board here and PP3V3_G3H is 0,0V and PM_EN_P3V3_G3H is also 0,0V. Charger stuck at 5V and 32mA. Sometimes when board is lying around it switches to 20v also 32mA. But if you plug in plug out and so on normally getting only 5V. ISL9239 is getting 5volts but no output on PM_EN_P3V3_G3H. Can we say that 100% the ISL9239 is bad, or is there also an enable signal for the ISL9239? No short found on PM_EN_P3V3_G3H and PP3V3_G3H"
