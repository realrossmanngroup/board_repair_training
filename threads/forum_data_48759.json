When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

Inspection revealed liquid damage around <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> which had also burned <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and the <SIGNAL>CHGR_PHASE</SIGNAL> pad underneath. Smaller amount of liquid damage around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>. \n\nWhat I have done so far:\nRun a jumper wire for <SIGNAL>CHGR_PHASE</SIGNAL> between <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and L7130\nChecked for any obvious shorts to ground on <SIGNAL>PP_BUS</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>CHGR_PHASE</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>CHGR_LGATE</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>CHGR_SGATE</SIGNAL> - found none\nReplaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> - multiple times as a pair with new chips\nReplaced <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR> and checked resistance between pins 27 and 28 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> to confirm 20ohms\nReplaced <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR> and checked resistance between pins 17 and 18 - found even after replacement it wasnt 3ohms so traced the fault back and found no continuity between <RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7150</RESISTOR>\nRan a jumper wire between <RESISTOR>R7152</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7150</RESISTOR> and checked resistance between pins 17 and 18 - now reads 3ohms\nReplaced <RESISTOR>R7125</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7125</CAPACITOR> as they didnt look nice - tested ok with the meter but replaced anyway\nFound <RESISTOR>R7185</RESISTOR> is only reading 1.2kohm instead of 470k as per spec - replaced it and <CAPACITOR>C7185</CAPACITOR> but it still reads 1.2kohm makes me suspect <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> has an issue but I am getting <SIGNAL>PP_DCIN_CHGR</SIGNAL> at 19v with my 85w charger. \n\nCurrently the board will:\nRun fine off a charged battery - which points me squarely at an issue with the charger input side of the circuit. \nIt will also run off a charger but I believe <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> to be partially burned now as it is allowing around 17V through it to make PPBUS 17v which obviously means the system won't charge the battery as the voltage is to high. \n\nJust for reference with a previous <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> I was only getting 4V on PPBUS"
