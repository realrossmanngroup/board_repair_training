Hopefully someone has already cracked this.\n\nCPU Proximity -(TC0P) Reads above the high limit\nCPU Die - (TC1C)  Reads above the high limit\nCPU B Die 1  (TC2C) Reads above the high limit\nCPU B Die 2 (TC3C Reads above the high limit\nCPU Core Peci (TCXC) Reads above high limit\n\n\nI have checked all pullups on the SMBUS, replaced the SMC, and replaced  U5110, just in case GND_SMC_AVSS was the issue.\n\nI also U5870 &U5850 incase these where bad.\n\nObviously i got some more learning to do.\n\nHelp please !!"}

Check CPU temperature and heat sink contact. Maybe bad heat pipe."}

The bad heatpipe never even entered my train of thought.\n\nThis is like the 2nd heatpipe I have ever had to replace.\n\nProblem Solved....."}
