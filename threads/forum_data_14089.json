Hopefully someone has already cracked this.\n\nCPU Proximity -(TC0P) Reads above the high limit\nCPU Die - (TC1C)  Reads above the high limit\nCPU B Die 1  (TC2C) Reads above the high limit\nCPU B Die 2 (TC3C Reads above the high limit\nCPU Core Peci (TCXC) Reads above high limit\n\n\nI have checked all pullups on the SMBUS, replaced the SMC, and replaced  <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>, just in case <SIGNAL>GND_SMC_AVSS</SIGNAL> was the issue.\n\nI also <CHIP>U5870</CHIP> &<CHIP>U5850</CHIP> incase these where bad.\n\nObviously i got some more learning to do.\n\nHelp please !!"
