Although I paid for the latter they sent the former.\nIn other words the LCD screen was from an A1398 running with an 820-00426.\n\nIve verified the pinout on the video connector - they are identical.\nShould this work or would there be a mismatch between board and LCD assembly?\n\nThis is the first ever video connector Ive soldered on a board and Im not very good.\nFirst thing the I-PEX I bought doesn't have tags to sit flush with the board at the ends so I had to use a lot of solder.\nI am not real happy with the way the male seats in but I am seeing video.\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][\/TD]\n\n[TD]value[\/TD]\n[TD]trace good[\/TD]\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]R7747[\/TD]\n[TD]0 ohm[\/TD]\n[TD]yes[\/TD]\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]R7758[\/TD]\n[TD]0 ohm[\/TD]\n[TD]yes[\/TD]\n[TD][\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]\n\nAs mentioned I have no other LCD to try.\nIs it safe to ground BKLT_SD at U7701 to see if backlight on LCD turns on?"}
