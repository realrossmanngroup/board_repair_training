        "message":"[B]Hello everyone, in general[\/B]\n\n\nThere was a slight flooding in the area of U1900 + corrosion. There was no backlight, but the beech started and showed a picture. Locally cleaned the board in the area of U1900, removed and installed U1900, soldered the nearby resistors and capacitors, after that there is no more startup and a short circuit appeared on PP3V3_S5, PP3V3_S0, PPVRTC_G3H\n\n[B]What was done:\nRemoved U1900, C1910, U7701, U6100, U6101, C6101, C3280, C3281, C8070 There is no result\n\nL7430 is removed\nPin 1 (PP3V3_S5_REG_L) is clean\nPin 2 (PP3V3_S5_REG_R) is shorted on the GND\n\nDiod mode:\n\nPP3V3_S5 .004\nPP3V3_SUS .004\nPPVRTC_G3H .002\nPP3V3_S0 .005\n\nNo idea[\/B]"

Have I disconnected the battery and MagSafe?\"\nYes, cannot check diode mode with power applied on the board.\n\n\"PPVRTC_G3H still short on the GND\"\nIf you removed mentioned caps from RTC power rail and also U1900, then PCH is shorted to ground.\n\nBTW, any reason to quote an entire post visible few centimeters above?\nWrite directly on reply box, instead of clicking Reply button.\nPlease, maintain forum aesthetic..."
