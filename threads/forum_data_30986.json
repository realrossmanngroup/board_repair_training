I have removed the villainous JTAG and have noticed that over time to the CPU gets warm and almost to operating temperature under the heat sink. I have all S5 rails and I have 8.58V PPBUS. CPU VCORE is 0v and diode mode reading is 0.007 known good is 0.012. No S0 rails or S3 rails. Is this RIP for the CPU?"

        "message":"I get 0V on PPVCC_S0_CPU as well as the PH1 and PH2 variants of the rail. I do have the 8.58V on ISNS Computing rail going to the FETs 7310 and 7320 I do not have any of the data lines going to the FETs to prompt them to open. I thought this was because the controllers were not being told to open the FETs and when I checked the controllers U7310 and U7320 I noticed there since PP5V_S0 is not present those controllers aren't being powered. There is no short on PP5v_S0, I guess it is possible that the controllers may not be straight to ground but still dissipating most of the voltage needed to power the CPU?"
