I have removed the villainous JTAG and have noticed that over time to the CPU gets warm and almost to operating temperature under the heat sink. I have all S5 rails and I have 8.58V PPBUS. CPU VCORE is 0v and diode mode reading is 0.007 known good is 0.012. No S0 rails or S3 rails. Is this RIP for the CPU?"

I do have the 8.58V on ISNS Computing rail going to the FETs 7310 and 7320 I do not have any of the data lines going to the FETs to prompt them to open. I thought this was because the controllers were not being told to open the FETs and when I checked the controllers <CHIP>U7310</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7320</CHIP> I noticed there since <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is not present those controllers aren't being powered. There is no short on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>, I guess it is possible that the controllers may not be straight to ground but still dissipating most of the voltage needed to power the CPU?"
