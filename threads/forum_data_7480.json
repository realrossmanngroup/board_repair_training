On a cracked-screen, non-spill board that had no other issues I have about 15.9V on PPVOUT_S0_KBDBKLT. No keyboard backlight. Tried SMC and PRAM resets. The keyboard backlight level meter is going up and down normally on the screen. Photometer is working normally. Trying to find a test backlight."}

Keyboard backlight plugged in. Booted into system. Nothing else plugged in.\n\nR7720 and R7721 both start around .85V and work their way up. It just measured at 1.6V after staying around .9V for a while. The voltage is always seemingly unstable too. It bounces around wherever it is. Not much, maybe plus or minus .25V.\n\nNo voltage on R7733.\n\nCustomer would like keyboard backlight fixed also. No sign of spill. Board looks clean and undamaged. Not sure why this failed."}

Only things on this bus are SMC and backlight chip. I wouldn't touch this any further."}

I have a good 820-3536 board and I'm measuring .055V with it booted and keyboard backlight on. The .485V I measured on the bad board is weirdly much higher. Not sure what to make of this."}

There in nothing to this circuit besides the SMC and backlight chip. If you want to mess with it and take the risk start with the backlight chip. I know I wouldn't touch this."}
