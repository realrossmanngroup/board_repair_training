On a cracked-screen, non-spill board that had no other issues I have about 15.9V on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_KBDBKLT</SIGNAL>. No keyboard backlight. Tried SMC and PRAM resets. The keyboard backlight level meter is going up and down normally on the screen. Photometer is working normally. Trying to find a test backlight."

The voltage is always seemingly unstable too. It bounces around wherever it is. Not much, maybe plus or minus .25V.\n\nNo voltage on <RESISTOR>R7733</RESISTOR>.\n\nCustomer would like keyboard backlight fixed also. No sign of spill. Board looks clean and undamaged.
