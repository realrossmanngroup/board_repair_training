        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

            "message": "Motherboard does not appear to have any liquid damage, client had the computer put away in a closet for 2 years because the blank screen was all he got. \nI did replace the L8300 because it caught on fire when I was doing testing. I gave it a new LVDS cable, gave it a new J8300 connector. I verified the LVDS cable was making contact on both sides. I actually did have it working briefly, but when I went to put the computer back together, it went back to the same thing, so it is intermittent. I was also able to get an external screen working via DisplayPort. As of right now though, I only hear it chime, and the USB mouse is not lighting up. I noticed from thermal camera at one point <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> was getting pretty hot, but it all seems to be working. I am thinking a GMUX issue? Right now the external screen via Displayport is no longer working (maybe the intermittent issue?).\nHere are some troubleshooting points I found interesting:\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> pins 3 and 4 have 12V, but nothing for pins 6/5/1/2.\n<TRANSISTOR>Q9690</TRANSISTOR> pin 1 is 3.3V, pin 3 is nothing.\nI tried heating up <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> but no changes. \nI can see the GPU and CPU does heat up when plugged in from thermal camera. Magsafe does show Green to amber. SMC and PRAM resets did work with onboard keyboard, but seemed very slow at responding to the SMC reset each time. \n<RESISTOR>R8318</RESISTOR>, around this area looks a little dirty, but nothing stood out visually. \nWhere do I go from here? Thank you!"
