I have a 820-00281 that took a heavy blow to the keyboard by some kind of heavy object. There is significant indent in the keyboard around the U, I, J, and K keys and the whole keyboard itself is not functional anymore. I put the board in a new topcase and it turns on, keyboard works, and the board seems to boot but I have no image on internal or external display. Caps lock key works when pressed, USB drive with OSX lights up and flashes when connected, and after about a minute or so, the touchbar turns on. I checked the voltages for the LCD, with the LCD connected ,and have listed them below. EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN and PANEL_FET_EN_DLY are fluctuating between 0-0.5v so thinking maybe there is an issue with U9800? The board is spotless and has no signs of corrosion or other damage that I can see.  \n\nPP5V_S0SW_LCD - 0v\nPP3V3_S0SW_LCD - 0v\nEDP_PANEL_PWR_EN - Fluctuates between 0 and .5v\nPANEL_FET_EN_DLY - Fluctuates between 0 and .5v\nDFR_DISP_PWR_EN - 3.4v\nBUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN - 0v\nBUF_SMC_REST_L - 3.4v\nDFR_DISP_SMC_RST_L - 3.4v\nSMC_RESET_L - 3.4v\nDP_INT_HPD - 0v"}

The indent in the keyboard is very close to where U9800 is on the board so its definitely possible there is a broken trace or solder under it."}

I get 20v 250ma and seem to have all voltages except for CPU and GPU voltages. ALL_SYS_PWRGD is 3.3v and PPVCCSA_S0_CPU is 1.1v but PPVCC_S0_CPU is 0v. I noticed that U8605 seems to be getting warm now also but I could not find any shorts. I removed the plate\/cover on J9600 and the amps drop to 190ma and U8605 does not get warm anymore. Could I have done some damage to J9600 during the PCH reflow or could a dead PCH cause this?"}
