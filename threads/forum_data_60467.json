            "message": "So, I have this <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> machine I bought from eBay because I'm an idiot.\n\nAs soon as I got it I could see melted plastic and ripped up screwposts near the gpu. \nHowever the seller seems like a nice guy and said the laptop was like that when he bought it, but it's been working until recently. He also refunded me a good chunk of my money so I got an alright deal overall.\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q8930</TRANSISTOR> was shorted so I replaced it along with <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> from a donor board. Now the laptop will start and chime, but I get no voltage at L8930/L8960, and therefore no image or backlight. This is because <SIGNAL>GPUVCORE_EN</SIGNAL> is low/zero, but <CHIP>U9100</CHIP> area looks good. \n\nIn the past I've seen dead GPUs on these boards but usually it'll at least get VCORE and show an image with artifacts. Should I just give up and bypass the GPU or is something else keeping <SIGNAL>GPUVCORE_EN</SIGNAL> low (it's not shorted to ground, I checked)\n\nAny help is hugely appreciated, thanks"
