So i was using a magesafe 1 charger with the magsafe 2 adapter piece apple sells for some reason on the 2015 boards this causes a glitch where the logic board won't turn on, this has has happened to me on a same identical board in the past and i could not figure out why. I used my magsafe 2 from my retina mac and bam it was turned on like a fuking hore, i was pissed all that time wasted for a freaking charger issue i have learned my lesson \"USE THE RIGHT CHARGER TO TEST YOUR LOGIC BOARDS\"."}
