Replaced obviously bad ones, lifted the fets\/cleaned pads.  Every power is present but CPUVCC and screen\/backlight as far as I can tell, even lid signals.\n\nNot stuck in DFU, had to force DFU using keycombos to make sure.  Just \"macintosh\" in sys profiler unless i force dfu.  Didn't restore bridgeos, customer needs data preferably, assuming possible.\n\nPCH is getting power and warming up ok, what's next to check on this?  Thanks!"}
