I have tested with another compatible screen, but the issue is the same there.\nSee my attached image for what i mean by distorted/garbled image.\nAny ideas what may cause this issue? I have triple-checked the soldering on <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and its surrounding components: all looks flawless.\nAny ideas where to start chasin this issue?"
