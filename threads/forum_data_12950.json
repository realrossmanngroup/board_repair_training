        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "PP1V05_SUS": "What is PP1V05_SUS? The PP1V05_SUS signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that supplies 1.05 volts, typically used in a suspended (SUS) state of the laptop. This state is a low-power mode where essential system functions are maintained, but the majority of the system is powered down..",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",

        "P3V3S0_EN": "What is P3V3S0_EN? This signal enables the PP3V3_S0 power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
