A customer asked me to replace a cracked screen on A1708 EMC2978 Macbook pro.\n\nSo I did )) forgetting to disconnect the battery o_O\n\nAnd now no backlight on the machine, and i'm sure it works as we can see the image. Same thing with old cracked screen. As I thought the new screen might be wrong or faulty.\n\nHere some voltage details :\n\nOn disassabled board \/ no screen connected :\n\nPower consumption at wall :\n7.1 volts \/ 0.085 amps\n\nPP5V_S0_BKLT \/ R8444 - 5.11V\nU8400 pin 17,18 - 0V (C8442 is absent)\nU8400 pin 5 - 5V\nC8473 - 0V\nQ8400 - pins 3,4 - 13V, pins 1,2,5,6 - 0V\n\nHope i measured right components, kindly let me know if you need more info.\n\nBest regards"}
