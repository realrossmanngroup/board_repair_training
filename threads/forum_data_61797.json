A customer asked me to replace a cracked screen on <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> EMC2978 Macbook pro.\n\nSo I did )) forgetting to disconnect the battery <SIGNAL>O_O</SIGNAL>\n\nAnd now no backlight on the machine, and i'm sure it works as we can see the image. Same thing with old cracked screen. As I thought the new screen might be wrong or faulty.\n\nHere some voltage details :\n\nOn disassabled board / no screen connected :\n\nPower consumption at wall :\n7.1 volts / 0.085 amps\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_BKLT</SIGNAL> / <RESISTOR>R8444</RESISTOR> - 5.11V\n<CHIP>U8400</CHIP> pin 17,18 - 0V (<CAPACITOR>C8442</CAPACITOR> is absent)\n<CHIP>U8400</CHIP> pin 5 - 5V\n<CAPACITOR>C8473</CAPACITOR> - 0V\n<TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR> - pins 3,4 - 13V, pins 1,2,5,6 - 0V\n\nHope i measured right components, kindly let me know if you need more info.\n\nBest regards"
