Somehow a screw dropped on it sometime after, no idea how they pulled that off. Anyhow, I was missing PP5V_SUS and Q7840 was replaced, PP5V_SUS came back.\n\nSometimes the fan tries to move bit stops, it's not even a quarter spin, it's like a blip. I have PPVCCSA_S0_REG but I do not have PPVCORE_S0_CPU_PH2 or PH1\n\nIf I leave it on long enough, the CPU does get a little warm but, not hot, also when I plug in a mouse, it does light up but a USB drive stick does not.\n\nAny idea what to look for next?"}
