Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

            "message": "Hi guys. \n\nI have this <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with no power stuck at 20V 0amps. No liquid damage. The <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP>(<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>) was heating up a bit and I replaced it, one contact under it was gone, Pin 36 <SIGNAL>TBA_GATE_Q1</SIGNAL>. Also, I have replaced <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> cause it was heating up. Now I have the same state no power 20v. I noticed that <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is not going up and stays at 0.8v up to 1v variation, and there's no short measurement with diode mode. <CHIP>U4200</CHIP> had some dust and looks funny on the edges it peeled off. The strange thing that I found on the board\nit's a component under <RESISTOR>R4308</RESISTOR> which is not on the board view, but I'm guessing on the schematics it's XW4300 and it should be going to ground.  \n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated, thank you üôè\n\n [ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"319px\" alt=\"<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> ISL\"]61265[/ATTACH]"
