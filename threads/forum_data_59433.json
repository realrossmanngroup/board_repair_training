A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

After that the current in to the machine didnt rise over 3.6A\n\nSo I thought everything fine, gave it back the client. machine came in today with the same problem.\n\n\nSo i replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>/2, after that again no short but on mac safe no green/orange light, machine working good.\n\nSo I still replaced the DC-in conector. After that I got green/orange light. current in to the machine again until 3.6A\n\nSo I still have any idea what can be here the problem. I think, if I will give it back to the client it will break again.\n\nIs it possible that the dc-in still was broken and that was the main reason?\n\nis 20V on the laboratory-unit correct for <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> 2015 ?"
