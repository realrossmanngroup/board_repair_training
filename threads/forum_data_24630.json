        "message":"Hello, back from vacancy \n\ni got an i7 with dedicated ghraphics card that needs fixing. the shop said that the power jack was broken and they replaced it (no soldering) but that the pc was still dead\n\nafter removing half of the board components and injecting voltages i found a short under the CPU. the cpu is warm but most of the heat is under it... without removing the shittons of caps under there.. is there any way to cheat and find the culpirpt?the heat isn't enough to make alcohol evaporate\n\nthanks fellas"
