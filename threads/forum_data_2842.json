Either way all of those GPUs you will find are either someone else's shit stock, fake, or reballed.\n\nThe 216-809000 used to be available with a lesser fake/bs/reballed crap rate. I actually have a spool here I will never use. Send me your address and I'll send you a few for free. [/QUOTE]\nI have soldered a 216-810005 that I found here and voltages are ok, I just need to figure out that resistor you mentioned, almost done!"
