It initially started up to a circle with a line through it. I performed a DFU Restore, which completed successfully (padlock). Now, when I startup using Internet Recovery, the machine gets part way through startup, then the fan blows hard for an instant and it shuts down. I'm looking for a logic board hardware issue but haven't found anything. Identical behavior when installed in a different topcase. Passes the Apple Diagnostics test with \"no issues found\"."}
