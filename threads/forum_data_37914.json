It was dead when it came to me, no response on anything. Initially it had 8.6V on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and S3/S0 rails were pulsing from 0V to high once in about two seconds. When I was taking measurements and inspecting the board under microscope, it even randomly (after reconnecting the charger to measure something) turned on twice, booted to OS and worked well until I turned it off. But one day later (without any repair attempt, just inspecting the board under microscope and measuring power lines) PPBUS dropped to 8.17V and S3/S0 pulses disappeared.\nI thought <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> is gone, so I changed it for a new one. At once I also changed <CHIP>U4700</CHIP> (although there was no good reason to change it... I know), but that did not solve anything, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is still lower than it probably should be. I did not find any shorted rail. Charger is genuine Apple 29W, USB-C cable is in good condition, works well with other <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1534</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>'s that I've got here. Connector and flex cable is also tested/good.\n\nI'm not yet experienced with these boards and their design is quite different than the older ones, so I'm quite clueless... Even the schematics are worse than they used to be I think - I don't even understand how AON is produced.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 8.17V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL> 3.23V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_E85_SS</SIGNAL> 14.41V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.28V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.28V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 3.28V\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> is 0V, so all S4/S3/S0 rails are low\n\nThank you for any advice"
