        "A1706": "What is A1706? A1706 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3071, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00239, 820-00923..",
        "820-00239": "What is 820-00239? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D6902": "What is D6902? a DIODE.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "U3100": "What is U3100? a CHIP.",
        "U6903": "What is U6903? This chip is responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H in 2016-2018 model Macbook logic boards.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

Was getting 0V at <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> but I've replaced: <CAPACITOR>C6906</CAPACITOR>, <CHIP>U6903</CHIP>, <CAPACITOR>C6910</CAPACITOR> and <DIODE>D6902</DIODE> and now I do get 3.4V at <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> but diode reading I think is slightly high at .487 red to ground. Also I get a diode reading at <CAPACITOR>C6906</CAPACITOR> of .544 which I believe according to FlexBV should be OL both of those had those same diode values prior to replacing components. Components were pulled from board that started but dead CPU.\n\nNo known incidents with board. Very slight corrosion at RB261, RB260, RB264 & RB310 all those values check out ok and reflowed with flux. slight corrosion at <RESISTOR>R3110</RESISTOR>/1, <RESISTOR>R5322</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C3106</CAPACITOR> - all values check out, diode at <CAPACITOR>C3106</CAPACITOR> is .526 also reflowed with flux.\n\n<CHIP>U6903</CHIP>:\n1- 7.9V\n2 - 4.9V\n3 - 3.4V\n8 - 4.9V\n9 - 1V\n10 - 5V\n\nAny thoughts other than just simply going after swapping either <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>, UB300 or both?"
