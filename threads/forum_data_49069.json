        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "ISL9239": "What is ISL9239? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2016-2018 responsible for charging the battery and creating the power rail PPBUS_G3H.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",

            "message": "Have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> for no power no liquid whatsoever no signs of drop damage either. When I first got it in, it had no <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>. Was missing enable so replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> came back but no 20 volts on DC-in. Replaced both <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s, and now, this one is weird. It will show 5 volts on DC in for about 10 seconds or so on both ports, then it will shoot up to 20 volts at 0.00 amps. PPBUS is not present. DC in is a steady 20 volts and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is a steady 3.4 volts. Any ideas where to begin? PPBUS is for sure missing and not shorted to ground. I seem to have 5 volts on my TBA VDD pins and current sense resistor are not blown. Have tried 2 <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP> chips so far.\n\nSomething I did notice too when this first came in was that when I would open the lid on the device, the fans would ramp up really quickly then shut off. With the battery connected, the device at first would give fan spin and then nothing when testing. That makes me suspect of an SMC or sensor issue as well."
