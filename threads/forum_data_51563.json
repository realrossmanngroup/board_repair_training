        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",

        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",

            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> is giving me so much hard time ......guys , what typically do you do on a board with missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> ? At what point do you give up ? I mean on a board that is not liquid damaged and has no short to ground... please help , I need to be sure I have gone over it all before sending it off my desk , I would be risking my job if after I fail someone else get it done just because i was too dumb to figure it out . Please help me guys.  What am trying to say is , what rail sequence do you go over , before you can pack up on a board that is missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> .... please guys I really wanna know ... Thank you so much in advance."

I give up after I've cleaned up and replaced everything that had damage from a spill, tested for all necessary voltages (see above, and also make sure <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> is present), tested continuity with all the SPI lines (complete pain but necessary). But if I get a board with no spill I'm not feeling great. Those corrosion areas are almost always the easy path. With a no-spill board make sure it wasn't cleaned before. Look for any ugly areas that might have been cleaned already. I'm sure there's more but that's what I'm coming up with at the moment."
