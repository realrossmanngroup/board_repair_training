If left on long enough\/allowed to get hot enough the fans do start spinning.\n\nNo display via the screen nor via an External monitor.\n\nUsing the tool U-SEM2, I find Pins 6,10, 31, 33, 36 and 37 are reading abnormally.\n\nLooking at boardview pins 6 and 10 appear to be connected to the CPU. (DP_INT_HPD and LCD_IRQ_L)\n\nAs for 31 & 33 then 36 & 37. I replaced the inductors these sets of pins are connected to. On the otherside of the inductors\/filters is U3900 the T1 chip.\n\n\n\nIs the CPU or T1 chip dead? If either are dead I will say the T1 chip replacement is out of my wheelhouse at the moment."}
