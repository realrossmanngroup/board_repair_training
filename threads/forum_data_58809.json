It wasn't liquid-damaged. My guess is some type of bios issue. I'm trying to fix it with my Medusa but when I try putting a new bios on it I don't get any USB drives at the boot menu.

It happened again with an Air board. It's just that situation where the older computers can't see APFS yet, until you run the installer. Thanks so much."}
