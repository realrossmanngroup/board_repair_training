The logic board showed no signs of water damage at all.\nPPBUS_G3H was 1,5V and Pin 1 on U7000 was only 6.5V. Removed U7000 and the voltage raised to 16.5V on pin 1. With a new U7000 I got 12.5V on PPBUS_G3H and it booted just fine.\nNow my problem is that I get an X on the battery indicator in OSX and the battery doesn't charge. The BIL shows nothing when pressing the button.\nIt acts the same with or without the BIL connected. When measuring R5281 and R5280 they both have the correct resistance and the voltage is 3.4V on both.\n\nAm I looking at a bad SMC here or is there anything else that I should check?"}
