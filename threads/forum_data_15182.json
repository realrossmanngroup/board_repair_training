            "message": "I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2530</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that came in today totally dead but green light on the charger. The logic board showed no signs of water damage at all.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was 1,5V and Pin 1 on <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> was only 6.5V. Removed <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and the voltage raised to 16.5V on pin 1. With a new <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> I got 12.5V on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and it booted just fine.\nNow my problem is that I get an X on the battery indicator in OSX and the battery doesn't charge. The BIL shows nothing when pressing the button.\nIt acts the same with or without the BIL connected. When measuring <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> they both have the correct resistance and the voltage is 3.4V on both.\n\nAm I looking at a bad SMC here or is there anything else that I should check?"
