This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",

It was pretty grim when I opened it up and it had 3 or 4 real bad spots of corrosion!,\n\nIts had a good clean and after passing through the Ultrasonic the board looks like new again, \n\nI get just 5v  / 0 amps on USB-meter and I am reading a dead short to ground on anything related <SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL>\n\n( doing a visual inspection I cant see anything obviously wrong but do seem to have 2 missing components RC332 / CC332 - but unsure if this is one of those where the board dose not  match the schematic but I do not have another same board to compare? )\n\nWhere to start finding this short? I'm a bit lost on these newer boards?\n\nThanks in advance"
