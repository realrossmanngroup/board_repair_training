I can get video output via USB C, and the logic board powers on and boots mac os.\nThe history is liquid damage, no obvious corrosion except between pins 1 and 43 of J8500. Cleaned up and replaced LCD cable, verified no connection, but the problem still persists.\nI've been troubleshooting this one for a while but have come up pretty much empty handed.\n\nOriginally I thought there was a good chance that <CHIP>U9850</CHIP> was dead (the short might have sent backlight voltage to the chip), so I did some research and found a replacement for the CBTL06142EEE (I could not find it available for order) with a HD3SS212ZQET, which should be compatible. The system sill powers on but it still has no display.\n\nI get <SIGNAL>LCD_MUX_EN</SIGNAL> ad 3.3V.\n\n<SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> appears at 3.4 volts and disappears a second after power on. Same for <SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>DFR_DISP_SMC_RST_L</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>BUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>, and <SIGNAL>PANEL_FET_EN_DLY</SIGNAL> .\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> is .01 volts (almost nothing)\n\n<SIGNAL>PANEL_P5V_EN_D</SIGNAL> is 0 volts.\n\nCan anyone with a little more experience with the newer macs assist in troubleshooting? I'd really appreciate it.\n\nThanks,\n\nStefan"
