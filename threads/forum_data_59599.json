Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

            "message": "so, I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that's acting weird.\nIf I plug in the charger, the board will power cycle somewhere between 5-20 times roughly (pulsing the s0 rails)  until it will boot further (I can tell because the optical drive will make a noise). Sometimes I get picture when this happens and it'll work fine for a while, but the screen eventually cuts to black. Other times the screen will stay black but the board will stay on and stop power-cycling\nI have replaced <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> so that isn't the problem, sadly\nNow, while trying random things I noticed that pressing on <CHIP>U9320</CHIP> while powering on will often result in a successful boot right away, and image on screen also. What's more, the screen will often go black as soon as I stop pressing it. Because of this, I tried reflowing <CHIP>U9320</CHIP> thinking it might solve the problem, but no such luck. The board is behaving exactly the same after the reflow.\n\nSo, it's clear to me that there's likely a broken connection somewhere. What would be a good  way of pinpointing where the faulty connection is so I can reflow it?"
