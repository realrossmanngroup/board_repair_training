Sometimes I get picture when this happens and it'll work fine for a while, but the screen eventually cuts to black. Other times the screen will stay black but the board will stay on and stop power-cycling\nI have replaced C9560 so that isn't the problem, sadly\nNow, while trying random things I noticed that pressing on U9320 while powering on will often result in a successful boot right away, and image on screen also. What's more, the screen will often go black as soon as I stop pressing it. Because of this, I tried reflowing U9320 thinking it might solve the problem, but no such luck. The board is behaving exactly the same after the reflow.\n\nSo, it's clear to me that there's likely a broken connection somewhere. What would be a good  way of pinpointing where the faulty connection is so I can reflow it?"}
