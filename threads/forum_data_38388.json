            "message": "Got a Mac air of which the trackpad is frozen. Keyboard works. I changed the trackpad, same result. Measuring pin 10 of the trackpad connector it showed 0.5-1V not 3.3. After removing the board and no trackpad connected, its 3.3v. <RESISTOR>R4830</RESISTOR> os 0 ohms as it should be. Any ideas?\n\nOn a sidenote, there was a tiny liquid spil on <CAPACITOR>C7555</CAPACITOR> near <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> which after i replaced the IC and made a wire the mac worked again. Customer had issues with trackpad before the mac died. No liquid on cable.trackpad looks very clean."
