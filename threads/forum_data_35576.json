Am I wrong?\nAlso I'm mesuring 362Ohms between those \"2\" rails.\nI've noticed that i've forgot to put back <RESISTOR>R7640</RESISTOR> sorry.\nNow it's done and the fan is spining but increases until it stops"

Make sure by comparing with another 3115 there is no short on this rail. I can check resistance for you tomorrow.\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7630</TRANSISTOR> is suspect.
