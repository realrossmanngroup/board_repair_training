        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

It has the usual dirt and some surface corrosion for a board this age, but nothing too serious.\n It will chime and I get usb activity, the screen gets energized(goes to deep black when booting) but never show a picture. Tried with a spare screen so it's definitely a board issue\nI checked around the LVDS connector and L9008 was blown. Replaced with part from donor but still no image.\nWhat should I check next?"
