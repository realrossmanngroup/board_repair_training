I've checked for corrosion and found none. \n\nAs this my first ever ram replacement, my question, does it matter if the chip i used is of a different manufacturer but from the same donor board (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>)? The board needing fixed has chips from Skhynix but my donor boards has something else, which doesn't have a manufacturer name, just a pn, SEC740. Both the donor board and the board needing repairs are 8Gb boards. Only difference is the CPU, the board needing repairs is a 2.2GHz while the donor is a 1.8GhZ."
