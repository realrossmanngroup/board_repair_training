Someone obviously messed with <CHIP>U9300</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q9330</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q9331</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q9361</TRANSISTOR> as <CHIP>U9300</CHIP> has no bond on the edges and all of these had flux residues around. I changed all of them, but it's still the same. <SIGNAL>GPUVCORE_EN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_GPU</SIGNAL> gets tiny pulse after turning on. Not even a pulse on <SIGNAL>PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD</SIGNAL>.
