Someone obviously messed with U9300, Q9330, Q9331 and Q9361 as U9300 has no bond on the edges and all of these had flux residues around. I changed all of them, but it's still the same. GPUVCORE_EN and PPVCORE_GPU gets tiny pulse after turning on. Not even a pulse on PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD. Nothing on external screen."}
