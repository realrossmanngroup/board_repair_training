No green light is shown on the charger.\n\nWhen the mac came to me it looked like it had sustained water damage to the dc in board as some of the components were corroded, but the motherboard itself looks fine.[/SIZE][/B]\n\nIv tried 2x different chargers and 2x different dc in boards and it still wont charge. The battery has been changed and when it had charge in it the mac would run fine off the battery alone, until it went flat, then wont charge again, the mac reports the battery percentage correctly.\n\nI have replaced <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> also and still have the same problem.\n\nThe board has had some water damage at one point, but this seems to be only on the dc in board, the rest of the motherboard appears to be fine.\n\n\n[B]Here are some voltages from around <CHIP>ISL6250</CHIP> :[/B]\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_CSI_P</SIGNAL>\n14.50v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_CSI_N</SIGNAL>\n14.45v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_BOOT</SIGNAL>\n12.89v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_UGATE</SIGNAL>\n10.95\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V1_CHGR_VDDP</SIGNAL>\n5.05v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_CSO_N</SIGNAL>\n8.36v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_CSO_P</SIGNAL>\n8.36v\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL>\n2.97v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_RST_L</SIGNAL>\n3.3v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_VNEG_R</SIGNAL>\n1.3v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_VCOMP_R</SIGNAL>\n1.3v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL>\n14.2v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL>\n3.74v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_ICOMP</SIGNAL>\n1.54v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_CELL</SIGNAL>\n0v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_VCOMP</SIGNAL>\n1.52v\n\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_VCOMP_R</SIGNAL>\n1.44v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>\n3.39v\n\n[B]Resistors tested :[/B]\n\nVoltage @ <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> = 14.1v & 14.35v\n\nVoltage @ <RESISTOR>R7080</RESISTOR> = 14.69v & 5.57v\n\nVoltage @ <RESISTOR>R7001</RESISTOR> = 5.1v & 5.05v\n\nVoltage @ <RESISTOR>R7085</RESISTOR> = 14.62v & 5.7v\n\nVoltage @ <RESISTOR>R5420</RESISTOR> = 0.061v & 0.061v\nVoltage @ <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> = 14.65v\n\nVoltage @ <RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR> = 14.60v\n\nVoltage @ <RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR> = 14.60v\n\nVoltage @ <RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> = 8.36v\n\nVoltage @ L6995 = 8.36v (=<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>)\n\n\n\nEDIT >>>>>\n\nSo iv just tested <RESISTOR>R5311</RESISTOR> and also <RESISTOR>R5312</RESISTOR> and im getting 85k and 88k . Im testing in circuit so im not sure if im getting some measurement problem, or if you think these two could be the problem ?,\n\nalso <RESISTOR>R5313</RESISTOR> is 25.30k instead of 27.4k , <RESISTOR>R5314</RESISTOR> is correct rating.\n\n@ <TRANSISTOR>Q5410</TRANSISTOR> - <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACOK</SIGNAL> = 2.83v\n<SIGNAL>DCINVSENS_EN_L</SIGNAL> = 0v\n<SIGNAL>DCIN_S5_VSENSE</SIGNAL> = 14.59v\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_S5_VSENSE</SIGNAL> = 14.62v\nPDCINVSENS_EN_L_DIV = 7.18\n<SIGNAL>DCINVSENS_EN_L</SIGNAL> = 0v"
