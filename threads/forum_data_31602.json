        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "P5VS4RS3_EN_R": "What is P5VS4RS3_EN_R? P5VS4RS3_EN_R is an enable signal that turns on the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. The _R means the signal is asserted when the voltage is high(3.3v). .",

        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing."
