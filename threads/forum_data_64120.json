After a liquid spill and previous repair attempts, I\u2019ve managed to get the MacBook Pro to boot, but the touchpad isn't working. I\u2019ve tried using a different top case, but it didn't have any effect. I\u2019ve looked at the schematics and are trying to understand it, but need assistance. On RT702, I get 1.76 volts on both sides, but nothing is coming out from QT700. I am wondering if power only flows when the LID is active. Is there anyone who can guide me in the right direction?\nThx"}
