It worked and I could get an image. However, when booting, the process systematically get stuck at the end of the loading bar, with the Apple logo. I rebooted, ran the AHT, and noticed that the screen - which should be blue - was actually full of blue artefacts. Being unsure about the cause (faulty GPU or the quick-and-dirty-temporarily-fix applied), I took the logical board out of the mac again, removed the U8900, cleaned the surface properly, and soldered everything back in place.\nEventually, I put the logical board back in place, but it is now unable to boot.\n\nSix points that might be worth to mention, regarding the above process:\n1) When trying to remove the U8900 with the hot air soldering station, temp was 370\u00b0C. I made several attempts, stopping after 40-50sec,it was not working\n2) After a break, I started again at 420\u00b0C. U8900 left the the board after 5sec\n3) During the whole process, all the elements around the U8900 were below 2 layers of Kapton tape.\n4) I did not remove the thermal heatsink\n5) The U8900 chip ended stuck on the MagSafe connector before I soldered it back in place. Dunno if there is a risk for these chips to be \"erased\" by magnets (?)\n6) The AHT displayed an error, but at that point it was very likely irrelevant (4hdd\/11\/40000000:sata(0,0))\n\nCurrent situation:\nEverytime I plug the magsafe connector on the board (outside the laptop) the light of the charger is green for a second, then turns amber.\nFans start spinning for 1.5sec, then stop.\nThen they start spinning again for 1.5 sec, before stopping again.\nIt looks like the process could almost start a third time, but doesnt. We can hear a \"tick\".\nThen, nothing.\n\nPP3V42_G3H is OK ; C6999 pin 1 shows 3.45V, as L6995, R7941, L6754, C7002, U7000 pin 12, etc\nPP3V3_S5_SMC is OK: L4901, pin 2 shows 3.44V\n\nOn U7201:\nP3V3S5_EN, pin 21: 3.44V\nP3V3S5_PGOOD, pin 20: 3.41V\n[COLOR=rgb(235, 107, 86)]P5VS5_EN, pin 12: 3.44V \nP5VS4_EN, pin4: 0V\nP5VS4_PGOOD, pin5: 0V[\/COLOR]\n\nI checked a few more rails;\n[COLOR=rgb(235, 107, 86)]P5V0S0_SS @0V for 4sec, then 0.3V, when measured on pin4 of Q7860\nPP5V_S0 @0.26V\/0.27V then 4.67\/5V, then 0.26V again. It is never stable for more than a second\nPP5V_S4, on C7861, pin1 :1.27V, then 5.08V then 1.27 again\npin2 shows 0, then 0.27V\n\nP5VS0_EN, pin 3 on Q7865, shows 0V for 4 sec, then 0.3V,[\/COLOR]\n\nR7978is okish, 99.8Ohms,\n\nIm on the page presenting the Mobile System Power State Table, the S5 Rail Enables & PGOOD, S0 Rail PGOOD Circuitry, etc but I think there is maybe an issue with the PM_SLP_S3_L.\n\n\nWhat should I check next? Any suggestion is welcome."}

Thanks for the swift answer and the welcome.\n\nRegarding the artefacts and boot issues, I had tested with\/without trackpad, with\/without battery, and with\/without a new battery. It never changed anything.
