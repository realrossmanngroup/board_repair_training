            "message": "Hello there,\nI'm trying to fix a mistake, very likely mine, whose consequence seems to be an unstable 5V rail, on a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A logic board.\n\nContext:\nInitially, I had no image on both the external display and the laptop screen; since <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_GPU</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_GFX_REG</SIGNAL> were 0V, I applied some flux on the <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and used the soldering iron to make the joints look better. It worked and I could get an image. However, when booting, the process systematically get stuck at the end of the loading bar, with the Apple logo. I rebooted, ran the AHT, and noticed that the screen - which should be blue - was actually full of blue artefacts. Being unsure about the cause (faulty GPU or the quick-and-dirty-temporarily-fix applied), I took the logical board out of the mac again, removed the <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>, cleaned the surface properly, and soldered everything back in place.\nEventually, I put the logical board back in place, but it is now unable to boot.\n\nSix points that might be worth to mention, regarding the above process:\n1) When trying to remove the <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> with the hot air soldering station, temp was 370°C. I made several attempts, stopping after 40-50sec,it was not working\n2) After a break, I started again at 420°C. <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> left the the board after 5sec\n3) During the whole process, all the elements around the <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> were below 2 layers of Kapton tape.\n4) I did not remove the thermal heatsink\n5) The <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> chip ended stuck on the MagSafe connector before I soldered it back in place. Dunno if there is a risk for these chips to be \"erased\" by magnets (?)\n6) The AHT displayed an error, but at that point it was very likely irrelevant (4hdd/11/40000000:sata(0,0))\n\nCurrent situation:\nEverytime I plug the magsafe connector on the board (outside the laptop) the light of the charger is green for a second, then turns amber.\nFans start spinning for 1.5sec, then stop.\nThen they start spinning again for 1.5 sec, before stopping again.\nIt looks like the process could almost start a third time, but doesnt. We can hear a \"tick\".\nThen, nothing.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is OK ; <CAPACITOR>C6999</CAPACITOR> pin 1 shows 3.45V, as L6995, <RESISTOR>R7941</RESISTOR>, L6754, <CAPACITOR>C7002</CAPACITOR>, <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> pin 12, etc\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_SMC</SIGNAL> is OK: L4901, pin 2 shows 3.44V\n\nOn <CHIP>U7201</CHIP>:\n<SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL>, pin 21: 3.44V\n<SIGNAL>P3V3S5_PGOOD</SIGNAL>, pin 20: 3.41V\n[COLOR=rgb(235, 107, 86)]<SIGNAL>P5VS5_EN</SIGNAL>, pin 12: 3.44V \n<SIGNAL>P5VS4_EN</SIGNAL>, pin4: 0V\n<SIGNAL>P5VS4_PGOOD</SIGNAL>, pin5: 0V[/COLOR]\n\nI checked a few more rails;\n[COLOR=rgb(235, 107, 86)]<SIGNAL>P5V0S0_SS</SIGNAL> @0V for 4sec, then 0.3V, when measured on pin4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7860</TRANSISTOR>\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> @0.26V/0.27V then 4.67/5V, then 0.26V again. It is never stable for more than a second\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL>, on <CAPACITOR>C7861</CAPACITOR>, pin1 :1.27V, then 5.08V then 1.27 again\npin2 shows 0, then 0.27V\n\n<SIGNAL>P5VS0_EN</SIGNAL>, pin 3 on <TRANSISTOR>Q7865</TRANSISTOR>, shows 0V for 4 sec, then 0.3V,[/COLOR]\n\nR7978is okish, 99.8Ohms,\n\nIm on the page presenting the Mobile System Power State Table, the S5 Rail Enables & PGOOD, S0 Rail PGOOD Circuitry, etc but I think there is maybe an issue with the <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL>.\n\n\nWhat should I check next? Any suggestion is welcome."

Thanks for the swift answer and the welcome.\n\nRegarding the artefacts and boot issues, I had tested with/without trackpad, with/without battery, and with/without a new battery.
