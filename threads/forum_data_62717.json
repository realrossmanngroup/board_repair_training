        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",

When this is missing it is usually because 1) The screen is not detected or is the wrong screen 2) the GPU is not working 3) The inductor between the LCD connector & the 5v rail is blown due to someone plugging the cable in wrong 4) the chip creating it is dead.",
