A visual inspection showed L7710 with half of the top missing (can see inside the coil) and a few solder balls on\/stuck to C7714 and C7715. No other visual cues and as far as I know, these backlight parts have nothing to do with the RAM. \n\nIs there a way to find out which RAM chip is the issue, if at all? Can other issues cause the RAM beeps on retina boards?"}

Case broken on a coil is nothing, BUT, it could have broke if it fell\n\nHmm... What else could have gotten cracked if it fell?\n\nRam solder balls... \n\nDO NOT reflow them until you make sure you have all your DDR rails."}
