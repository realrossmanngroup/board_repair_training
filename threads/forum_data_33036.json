A visual inspection showed L7710 with half of the top missing (can see inside the coil) and a few solder balls on/stuck to <CAPACITOR>C7714</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7715</CAPACITOR>. No other visual cues and as far as I know, these backlight parts have nothing to do with the RAM. \n\nIs there a way to find out which RAM chip is the issue, if at all? Can other issues cause the RAM beeps on retina boards?"
