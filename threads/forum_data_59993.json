Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. ."

            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> once had a short on <TRANSISTOR>Q8961</TRANSISTOR>. After replacing it it worked fine. But just for a while.\n<TRANSISTOR>Q8930</TRANSISTOR> now has a short and it does not turn on. After replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q8930</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> at the same time it had fans-in again.\nbut no image :(. Did I fry the GPU? measuring it showed me that atleast it has no short on it. Tho it doesn't get warm and I have a Voltage reading neither on L8960 nor on L8930.\nWhat do you guys think could cause this issue. Should I measure if the traces are good ?"
