SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this lineâ€™s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
