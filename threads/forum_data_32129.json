Close the lid and re-open once fans no longer spin, the screen then displays.\nBoot into OS gives black screen. Close the lid and re-open, still no image.\nBoot into Linux Mint, all good, no issue.\n\n\nLiquid damage was also around the GPU and VRAM.\n\nMy guess is some crap got under the GPU or VRAM but I'm posting in hope."

I would be curious what <SIGNAL>LCD_MUX_EN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>LCD_MUX_SEL</SIGNAL> are going to <CHIP>U9150</CHIP> on your defective board vs. a known good.\n\nAn ancillary curiosity would be if <CHIP>U9210</CHIP> or <CHIP>U9200</CHIP> were damaged. <SIGNAL>DP_EXTB_MUX_EN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>DP_EXTA_MUX_EN</SIGNAL> appear to exist to deal with external monitors. <CHIP>U9210</CHIP> seems responsible for getting LCD recognition data passed between either the external/internal GPU and thunderbolt port A/thunderbolt port B. <CHIP>U9200</CHIP> appears responsible for getting actual image signal from internal/external GPU to thunderbolt port A/thunderbolt port B. I am curious if these were damaged at all, if it could be causing screwiness with detection of the internal screen only when plugged/unplugged.\n\nI would be curious what the SBI, SAI, ENB, ENA signals for each of these chips are on a working known good 3332 with internal LCD attached, and yours. I would be curious what any number of the enables around those two are like on a normal board vs. your malfunctioning one.\n\nI don't know the ins and outs to how this circuit works so I can't give an exact answer."
