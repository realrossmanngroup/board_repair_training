I2C_PWR_SCL is the clock line of the SMBUS data line between the system management controller(SMC), battery, ISL9240 battery charging chip, and power management unit(PMU). This line is necessary for the machine to communicate with the battery, see the battery, and use the battery.

Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

I2C signals from battery go to PMU, SoC and charger chip but I haven't yet replaced any of them. Which one first should I pay the attention to? Or maybe there is something else I missed? Please advise."

Did not do a DFU yet, however, did more measurements and found that <TRANSISTOR>Q7065</TRANSISTOR> is constantly switched on and off at 4 secs interval (4 secs on, 4 secs off). When on the gate voltage to ground is 4.2V, when off the gate voltage is 12.6V. Drain voltage changes from 12.6V to 0.15V respectively. Do you think DFU revive/restore may do the trick with that?"

I'm stuck with no further ideas... What I found is that with no PSU connected there is no single voltage on battery (power and signal pins = 0V). Shouldn't it be 3V on SMBUS at least? When PSU connected the MLB fires up normally but as soon as I unplug PSU the MLB switches off immediately, like no battery has been connected."
