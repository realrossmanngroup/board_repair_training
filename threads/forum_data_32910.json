Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics.

            "message": "This computer had the GPU cap problem. I replaced the cap with the larger capacitor and verified that the repair was working and the GPU passed stress testing. I then put the board in the ultrasonic to clean of the leftover flux, after the cleaning process the computer only chimes and POSTs with 2 GB of RAM installed. I have tried each stick in each slot and confirmed that both sticks are still good as well as both slots, even for grins I tried using a single 4 GB stick. When there is 4 GB of RAM installed the computer power cycles constantly and the optical drive will initialize over and over along with the power cycling. There is no red light on a USB mouse when the computer is power cycling either. Any ideas?"
