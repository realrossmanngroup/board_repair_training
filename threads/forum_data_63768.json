If it is low, the system thinks the lid is closed – if it is 3.3v, the system thinks the machine is open. SMC_LID_RIGHT needs to be high for the machine to stay awake and have a backlight. .",

Even after i unplug from the external display, the internal display never comes back on until reboot. No sure if this is related, but also noticed the internal display never goes off when the lid is closed. Any suggestions."
