U7600 had a little bit of crud on it so I replaced that, no other issues visually with the board.\n\nI ran out of hints as where to look next. Any pointers appreciated."}

Check for power pulsing. The usual suspects inspected? U1900\/1950, U6100 termination resistors\/traces? Check rails for short? PPBUS voltage?"}

Not it holds steady at 60\/70mV).\n\nU1950 16mV pin 2, 3.4V pin 8.\n\nU6100 3.3V all pins, continuity from all pins to their destinations OK.\n\nPPBUS is 12.6V at F7140.\n\nWould rails show the right voltage if there's a short?\n\nAmp draw on PSU is 0.021\/23"}

Still need to know if it may be power cycling, check on the 5V rail L7520. Preferably use a scope as many multimeters are too slow to catch the short pulses. Again check all rails for shorts to GND."}
