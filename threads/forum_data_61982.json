I was able to determine that when a USB pendrive is connected, the corresponding USB port and <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> it is connected to will generate 5v. However, macOS will report an error saying that USB needs power in order to work. I \n\nSo the USB ports are attempting to turn on but there appears to be a communication issue somewhere on the logic baord.\n\nLooking back at earlier pictures of the board I took before replacing the corroded <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>, I noticed that the Resistors <RESISTOR>R3100</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R3101</RESISTOR> are connected to <SIGNAL>USB_UPC_PCH_XA</SIGNAL> were significantly corroded. Both resistors were measuring proper resistance of 0 ohms. However, I think this is where my issue maybe.\n\nI am under the suspicion that when liquid killed <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>, the line <SIGNAL>USB_UPC_PCH_XA</SIGNAL> may have been over volted and killed part of the PCH.\n\nSince I have been working off an on with this one for a few months and potentially having a PCH issue, I am deeming it irreparable here. I hope this logic makes sense."
