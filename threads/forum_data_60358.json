Changing twice neither have changed I think I reballed a couple of those SMC's more than once to no avail. The fact that I have PPBUS G3H at 12.25 and no charger light should imply the SMC, correct?\n\nSMC's did come from other 3115 boards. One of the donor boards I pulled SMC from was known to boot but had other strange issue I couldn't resolve."}
