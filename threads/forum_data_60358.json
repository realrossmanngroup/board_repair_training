        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA": "What is PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA? PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state that powers the SMC that comes from PP3V3_S5. A blown or corroded L4901 inductor behind it can kepe it from working, inductor number will differ depending on your board. .",

Changing twice neither have changed I think I reballed a couple of those SMC's more than once to no avail. The fact that I have PPBUS G3H at 12.25 and no charger light should imply the SMC, correct?\n\nSMC's did come from other 3115 boards. One of the donor boards I pulled SMC from was known to boot but had other strange issue I couldn't resolve."
