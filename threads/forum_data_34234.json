They just look more bronze-ish than silver vs my current board. The PCB itself does not look burned just the components as seen in the attached picture.\n\nThe guy I bought it from swears he did not reflow the board and all the boards he has look like this. \n\nIs it possible the components can darken a bit over time from usage and the gpu temperature?ï»¿\n\nThank you to anyone that responds."

            "message": "Lots of things can cause dark solder joints...cleaning with thermal paste still in place (common), age/heat (also common, especially on older boards), heat from pulling larger chipsets, etc. If it's an old board like that, most likely age/heat, or an old reflow (by Apple or someone else, etc), but you'd see more signs of a reflow if that were the case. If they're ALL like that (regardless of model/age), I'd guess he is cleaning them with thermal paste still on the board (and he doesn't change his nasty UC water). Otherwise, it's just an old board."

Yeah, I was thinking there would be more heat damage seen on the pcb itself and was simply hoping that they were darker from age or extended use. I'm hoping that this being a 603 will last a little while for my customer. Or do you think she should sell it? (She uses it to mostly watch videos online which was why her 602 a1260 started going on her. )"

I found a replacement board from a \"reputable\" seller who has the board but instead of the faulty 600-602 series it has the 603 gpu in it which from what I've read doesnt have the same issues onchip that the others did.\n\nOnce I replace the board in her machine should I tell her to sell it or would it be okay for her to keep it a year or so till next tax season for a new one?\n\nThanks again!"
