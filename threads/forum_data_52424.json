No change when I try a known-good USB cable\/USB. I'm stuck. Any ideas?"}

Couldn't find D6901, 2 or 3. The USB port doesn't work for anything though, meaning it won't detect a drive or any device. It's like the port is not getting power on the one side. The USB power is just nonexistent on that side on my USB power meter."}
