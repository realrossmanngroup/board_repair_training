Does any of you have some idea what it could be ???? \nI have to say that all pieces are working with the clients old board but it suddenly restarts from time to time and that was the reason I now have 3 dead boards all taking 17 miliampere and stone dead..\nThe things I reused are , the trackpad , the side board (the small board on the side ) the laudspeakers , and the fans .....\nany ideas ...."
