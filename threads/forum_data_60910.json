Don't know if that's significant.\nI measured around the ISL9239 and got these values:\nGate_Q4: 0V\nLX2:          0V\nBoot2:      5V\nGate_Q3: 5V\nGate_Q2: 5V\nBoot2:      5V\nLX1:          0V\nGate_Q1: 0V\nNo shorts to ground on the caps.\nOn L7030 I get 0.02V on both sides.\n\nAre these values normal.
