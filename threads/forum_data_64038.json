Found UP9505S had pin 16 damage from an old liquid spill.[ATTACH type=\"full\"]61240[/ATTACH][ATTACH]61240[/ATTACH]replaced the chip and fixed the pad. Powers on, keyboard lights up for a second. After about 10 seconds both fans max out. Hold power button will shut down after about 10 seconds. If battery and power cord are connected, it turns back on instantly. If battery is connected, plugging in charger powers it on.\n\nGPU gets .8v and CPU gets nothing when powered on. I was thinking it's not repairable, but thought I'd check here if anyone may have any suggestions."

            "message": "Just getting beck to this today....\n\nThe BV was a help. Checked if BIOS recovery worked, and it doesn't, so before trying a manual programming, I have been checking around the replaced chip. <RESISTOR>R0609</RESISTOR> has 1.8v at pin 1 but not pin 2. Tests 4.7k Ohm. If this is PWR OK, shouldn't 1.8v go all the way to pin 50 of  UP9505S? I got 5v on pin 15, the EN, and 14, so I'm confused what I am missing here."

These are near the liquid effected area, so maybe I need to swap these out? I haven't found anything else this far off from specs in the schematic."
