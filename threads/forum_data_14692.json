            "message": "Hi we have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that did not start up. It had very small liquid damage on <RESISTOR>R5641</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5193</RESISTOR> near the SMC which we replaced and also no 1.05v. We replaced <CAPACITOR>C7630</CAPACITOR> (one side was corroded) and wired pin 1 to pin 1 from <RESISTOR>R7630</RESISTOR> and after this the macbook starts up. Runs fine on battery, however, then we connect the charger the screen blacks out and we do not get any light on the charger. Fan keeps spinning and as soon as we remove the charger the display turns on again. With nothing but I/O board connected the mac also boots up but no light on the charger. Could not find a short in <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>. The I/O board also had a tiny green spil on it, after ultrasonic still the same, replaced the board and cable, still the same. Any ideas on this one?"
