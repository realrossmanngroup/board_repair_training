        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PM_PCH_APWROK": "What is PM_PCH_APWROK? a SIGNAL.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U8160": "What is U8160? a CHIP.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_PCH_PWROK": "What is PM_PCH_PWROK? PM_PCH_PWROK is usually created by U1950, a 74LVC2G08GT chip and is necessary for the machine to wake from an S5 and S4 state and turn on. This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",
        "CPUVR_PGOOD_R": "What is CPUVR_PGOOD_R? CPUVR_PGOOD_R is a signal that comes from CPU_VR_EN that is necessary along with ALL_SYS_PWRGD to create PM_S0_PGOOD.",

        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",

        "U5870": "What is U5870? a CHIP.",
        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

I started measuring around and i'm missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> so i watched on one of louis videos with similar problem so when this signal took me to the PCH i checked for the voltage that powers the PSH  -- <SIGNAL>PM_PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> and that took me to <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>, and there i have voltage on pin 8 (<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H_CSPWRGD</SIGNAL>) and pin 2 (<SIGNAL>CPUVR_PGOOD_R</SIGNAL>) and the important signal im missing is pin 1 (<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>) so i tried to find where this signal comes from and that took me <CHIP>U8160</CHIP> and that component doesn't exist on the board just empty pads. This shit is confusing. Any ideas ?"
