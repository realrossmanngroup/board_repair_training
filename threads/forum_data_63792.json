        "message":"Hi guys.\n\nI have this A1502 with no power. I have all power lines present,  U1900  I replaced them just in case, PM_SLP_S4_L  is present, no short anywhere. I had the camera chip U3900 heating up near contacts 14 and 29 and I removed it not heating up anymore. Now when I plug it in, as before green light comes on with no power and only U2800 warms up to nearly 30 degrees and nothing else. What I noticed is that when I have the SSD plugged in(tried 2, and one is known good) warms up the main controller on it up to 45-50 degrees and continues slowly up. Do any ideas come up, cause going in circles here  o_O :ROFLMAO:"
