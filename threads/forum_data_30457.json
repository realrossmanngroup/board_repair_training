I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q5500</TRANSISTOR> and checked the resistors and cap on the circuit line and everything measures ok. PPBUS without a battery is 8.58 volts. With a battery, it starts at 7.6 with the machine off and the charger plugged in then as it boots it goes up to 8.4 volts. The battery is only at 15%, so my question is once again\n\n1. Does this matter and should I stress over it?\n2. Could the sensor be pulled down by a old or shit battery?"
