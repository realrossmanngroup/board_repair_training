            "message": "This one came in with severe water damage. After ultrasonic cleaning and fixing CPU VCORE power issue it started up with no backlight. I knew it would because it had a lot of corrosion around backlight circuitry. I changed all corroded resistors and caps around <CHIP>LP8550</CHIP> and also the <CHIP>LP8850</CHIP> itself. Some traces needed wire. Also the pulldown resistor on <SIGNAL>BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL> was corroded so I have changed it and put a wire on the broken trace.\n\nNow the backlight is working partially. When I start the computer backlight turns on. The brightness is 100% even if I turn it down. <SIGNAL>BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL> is pulsing - long pulses on high brightness and short pulses on low brightness - but still full brightness around 40V on LCD connector. But when computer goes to sleep backlight does not come back on every time. Sometimes it comes right away - sometimes after 30 seconds - and sometimes not at all before I shut down and turn the machine back on. When backlight is not working after sleep then I get 19-20V on LCD connector.\n\nI tried giving <SIGNAL>BKLT_PVM</SIGNAL> 3V from <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> but still only 19V on backlight after sleep.\n\nWhat am I missing ?"

            "message": "Thanks Duke for pointing me in the direction of measuring diode mode on <CAPACITOR>C9704</CAPACITOR> with <RESISTOR>R9704</RESISTOR> removed. It showed up that I had a microscopic OL around the probe point for <CAPACITOR>C9704</CAPACITOR>. I couldn't even see it in the microscope on highest zoom setting. But the multimeter saw it :) Made a trace and brightness now is adjustable and backlight wakes from sleep.\n\nThanks again you can mark this one solved. Thumbs up!"
