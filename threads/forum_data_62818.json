        "message":"Hi, received this logic board with little corrosion around cd3217 and some around the toucid sensor chip. See attached pictures. Laptop boots when connected to battery and charger but does not charge. Also no 19v on USB C amp meter. Everything works when booted but only from battery. \n\nAfter cleaning with amtech V2 good flux saw that pin 8 of UF260 (USB ROM chip) was damaged. Cleaned it and added new solder. Still 5v 0,225a after 6 sec back to 0,055a. So tried a USB ROM from a2159 Same specs. Now it goes to 20v 0,109A but still no charger recognized... I remember reading something about copy rom before installing but never done that before.\n\nDo you think rom chip is damaged and needs to be replaced?"

This one was never charging. When connected to battery it will boot and work fine but does not charge. With original rom, keeps at 5v... But when I connect a a2159 rom it will go upon to 19v.
