Laptop boots when connected to battery and charger but does not charge. Also no 19v on USB C amp meter. Everything works when booted but only from battery. \n\nAfter cleaning with amtech V2 good flux saw that pin 8 of UF260 (USB ROM chip) was damaged. Cleaned it and added new solder. Still 5v 0,225a after 6 sec back to 0,055a. So tried a USB ROM from <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2159</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> Same specs. Now it goes to 20v 0,109A but still no charger recognized... I remember reading something about copy rom before installing but never done that before.\n\nDo you think rom chip is damaged and needs to be replaced?"
