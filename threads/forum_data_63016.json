I just changed the Serial number section on the file and the iMac worked okay.\n\nIt came back and wont boot. This imac has the Fusion Drive (hdd +ssd). I made all the process to erase everything, create the fusion drive and reinstall the OS, but I was only able to install Mojave, with any other OS version (catalina, big sur, monterey) the Imac wont boot into the OS, it showed the \"your mac restarted because of a problem\" screen. \n\n-I tried to install only on the HDD (not fusion) and same problem. Only worked with Mojave.\n-I tried installing with USB drives and also with the online installer. And same Issue. \n-I tried SMC and PRAM reset. \n-The mac boots in safe mode ok in any OS version \n-I would open the iMac and try another file, but the screen is a little cracked and I am afraid of damage it. \n\nAny idea of what could be happening? \nIs there a way to update the firmware of the mac without open it?\n\n\n\nThanks!!"}
