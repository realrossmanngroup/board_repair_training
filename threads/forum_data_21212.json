No SLP. No pulse on 5V_S4. The board came to me after ultrasonic so not a lot of clues. I see slight signs of damage to a capacitor on 3V3_S0 and PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS. Everything seems good as far as shorts. None that I can find. Any suggestions for a next step?"}

SMC_LID capacitor and resistor area (R5250, C5250) was slightly damaged and repaired by someone else before. I tested it. Working correctly. Has 3.42V.\n\nI'm stumped."}
