But yeah very likely the case. Remove it and see if short clears. Also make SURE PPBUS and PPVRTC are not also short once you remove the SMC to avoid wasting time. Sometimes I?ve seen the SMC shorting cause all of them to short to ground and kill the CPU. Not often, but it can happen. I would assume if the SMC is short this will be an easy one."}

I injected 3V 2A and only could find SMC heating up. I then removed the SMC and confirmed short is now gone. PPBUS and PPVRTC are not shorted with SMC removed, so it looks like my culprit is the SMC. I have never replaced one before, but just to make sure, all I really need is a stencil and a donor board to pull one from, correct?\n\nThanks again for all the advice."}
