Seems so odd that they would fail suddenly since their just sort of inert in the case and it can happen out of nowhere?\nIts like the zombie of  the 2012 13\" MacBook Pro hard-drive cable has come back to haunt the retinas.\nI'm guessing it has to do with the it shorting at a bend point (why do they put so much slack on it anyway!?).\nAny idea why this seems to happen so much?"
