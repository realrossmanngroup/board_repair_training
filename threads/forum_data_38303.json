        "message":"Hi everybody,\nI'm working on a retina board for a graphic issue at the begining\nSo I reflowed the U9300 and after that at first boot fan for 3 seconds then stop and now nothing,\n\nI checked\n\nU7100 between 17 and 18 = 3.5\u03a9\nU7100 between 27 and 28 = 21.5\u03a9\nU7100 PIN2 = 20V\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 1.67volts\nPPDCIN G3H = 20,43v\nPP3V42 G3H = 3.43v\nPP5V_S5 = 0.851v\nPP5V_S0 = 0.455v\nPP3V3_S5 = 3,3v\n\nI can't find a solution for this board I can try to replace U9300 but do you think that this component can cause this ?\nOr something else is burned now ?  I used a Chinese adapter so perhaps that have nothing with U9300\n\nThanks for help"
