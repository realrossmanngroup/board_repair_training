        "message":"It seems as though the 2850 is notorious for C9560 issues as its a Poly Tant Cap. I was wondering, I have a number of donor boards (different numbers), but all the 330UF caps seem to be Poly Tant.  Are there boards with better versions or should I just buy a CERM 330uf from digikey or something?  Also does it matter if its a 2.5v cap? just as long as its 330UF?\n\nPS. Symptoms are that it intermittently shuts down and gets really hot really fast around the CPU.  Shutdown\/reset seems to happen frequently after \"waking\", but also during use of Safari. Its fully functional otherwise, and has no signs of drop or liquid. Figured I would do a plz bro repair with the cap since they are so common with these."
