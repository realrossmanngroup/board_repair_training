Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

            "message": "It seems as though the 2850 is notorious for <CAPACITOR>C9560</CAPACITOR> issues as its a Poly Tant Cap. I was wondering, I have a number of donor boards (different numbers), but all the 330UF caps seem to be Poly Tant.  Are there boards with better versions or should I just buy a CERM 330uf from digikey or something?  Also does it matter if its a 2.5v cap? just as long as its 330UF?\n\nPS. Symptoms are that it intermittently shuts down and gets really hot really fast around the CPU.  Shutdown/reset seems to happen frequently after \"waking\", but also during use of Safari. Its fully functional otherwise, and has no signs of drop or liquid. Figured I would do a plz bro repair with the cap since they are so common with these."
