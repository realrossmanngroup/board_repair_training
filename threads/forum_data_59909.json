        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U7001": "What is U7001? a CHIP.",
        "D7010": "What is D7010? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year retina model macbook pros, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. ."

The light won't come on the charger there is no voltage at J7000 and it's not charging. I've tried a different charging socket (known good in another macbook) which also doesn't work. If I use a chinese charger the green light appears and the machine powers up and works, charges fully no issues. \nI'm wondering what the issue could be maybe <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>/<CHIP>U7001</CHIP>? Can't see any liquid damage on this board it's clean"
