I'm working with an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that had a blown F7140.  Fixed that but still no power or fan spin and found there to be a short on <CAPACITOR>C7313</CAPACITOR>.  Replaced <CAPACITOR>C7313</CAPACITOR> and now I get fan spin, high speed, but no green light on charger.  It also seems like there may be another short somewhere on the board.  Sometimes taking a voltage measurement causes the board to reset itself or it may be coincidence with the board resetting(?)\n\nI'm not sure which issue to address first or how to proceed from here.\n\n<SIGNAL>P5VS0_EN</SIGNAL> is 5.18V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 8.57V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_AOK</SIGNAL>: 3.374V\n<SIGNAL>P1V8S3_PGOOD</SIGNAL>: 3.341V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>: 15.04V\n<SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL>: 0.946V (moving with a +/- 0.025V).\n<SIGNAL>SMC_S5_PWRGD_VIN</SIGNAL>: 3.374V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_P1V05S0_VSENSE</SIGNAL>: 1.054V\n<SIGNAL>P1V05S0_PGOOD</SIGNAL>: 3.340V\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>: 3.341V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>: 3.375V\nResistance to ground on <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>: 174KOhm\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_RST_L</SIGNAL>: 3.374V"

So now I need to find the connector on mouser or find a donor board that has the same connector for cheap.  At the risk of going off-topic in this thread, anyone know of another board that has the same style connector or a source for good donor boards these days?  I looked at some others that I had around but none are the same; no MB Airs around.\n\nSteve"

            "message": "Putting closure on this one, it was related to the LIO - though specifically the J7000 connector on the motherboard itself.  One of the pins on there must have been broken already which caused inconsistent behavior and maybe was responsible for the initial fuse issue. Once I finished the job of breaking it off completely I was able to work around the broken connector and the board now turns on, boot chimes, and shows the question mark folder, awaiting a drive and OS install.\n\nThanks for the help\n\nSteve"
