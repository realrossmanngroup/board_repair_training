        "820-3330": "What is 820-3330? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U9600": "What is U9600? a CHIP.",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "LCD_BKLT_PWM": "What is LCD_BKLT_PWM? LCD_BKLT_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",

        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",

Uhh alright\n\n<SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> is a High or Low signal enabling the Backlight circuit\n<SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL> (PWM being Pulse Width Modulation) is the signal that tells the backlight how bright it should be.\n\nOf course when shorting these two together you won't be able to control the brightness... I'm also not sure if <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> likes this, you might be damaging its PWM pin\n\nIf  you have 20V on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> you should have working backlight, are the measurements in your title taken with the _EN to _PWM short or without?"
