        "message":"Ok so let me get this straight, you just combined LCD_BKLT_EN and LCD_BKLT_PWM? Uhh alright\n\nLCD_BKLT_EN is a High or Low signal enabling the Backlight circuit\nLCD_BKLT_PWM (PWM being Pulse Width Modulation) is the signal that tells the backlight how bright it should be.\n\nOf course when shorting these two together you won't be able to control the brightness... I'm also not sure if U9600 likes this, you might be damaging its PWM pin\n\nIf  you have 20V on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT you should have working backlight, are the measurements in your title taken with the _EN to _PWM short or without?"
