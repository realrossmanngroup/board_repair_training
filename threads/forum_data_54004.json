I spent quite a bit of time replacing resistors, caps and anything that looked sketchy.\n\nI plugged in the USB-C charger and 5v for 5 seconds then boot loop. I never get 20v\nI am getting <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> at <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>\n\nI have tried the USB ports on the other side of the board as well. same shutdown bounce. So.... I am assuming that I have a failed device somewhere. I checked the rails for shorts and did not find any. One of the USB TI chips?\nI don't have much experience with this board. This is probably the second or third one I have worked on.\n\n\n[URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAIvjZOpm-k[/URL]"
