Not sure if it was a liquid repair or not but I don't think it was.\nScreen turned on then back off after a few seconds so I tied backlight PWM to S0, thought solved and sent it out thinking it was done.... Now thinking it could be something to do with what's presenting now.\n\nSo if I power this machine afer shutting down from OS it will chime, boot, everything works.\nClose lid, sometimes powers off instead of deep sleep after some time.\nWhen it powers off instead of sleeping - Turn it back on with no chime and no keyboard or trackpad.\nAfter booting to OS login screen, SMC reset and power on again it will chime and everything working.\n\nAny pointers please?"
