        "message":"Board is clean, no signs of liquid damage, PP3V42 is present\nPPBUS_G3H was at 4V, no green light on charger \nR7121, R7122 both blown\nI've replaced both resistors and U7100\nNow PPBUS_G3H is 12.6V as normal but I still don't have a light on the charger and board won't start. Board seems to start in SMC bypass mode\nSYS_ONEWIRE is 0.7v. I've tried replacing U7000 but no change.\nAlso tried reballing SMC, still no change.\n\nAnything else I should try before I replace the SMC?\nThanks"
