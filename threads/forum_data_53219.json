            "message": "Hello,\n\nI'm looking for some advice from someone more experienced with Mac repairs than I!\n\nI have a 2017 13\" MacBook Air that won't charge.\n\nI've done all the basic troubleshooting that I can and I'm to the point where I think it might be component level.\n\nThe symptoms:\n\nPlugged in, the power adapter LED indicator acts as it should; is shows orange for charging. The laptop senses that the power adapter is present and switches to ac power, but it won't charge the device. When I check the battery status is claims it's normal.\n\nI've tried different adapters, cleaning ports, swapping the battery from another device, resetting the smc etc.\n\nWhere should I begin further troubleshooting? There's no warranty on the device anymore.\n\nI have some basic soldering skills at the macro level, but would be more than happy to learn the micro level if it potentially saves me from buying a new logic board.\n\nAny help would be appreciated."

Unfortunately it looks like I won't get to dabble in looking into the logic board issue - just don't have the time currently and needed the machine back up and running ASAP. I work for an enterprise, so I unfortunately didn't have the time.\n\nThe battery was 100% working in the other machine. Tried the suspect battery in that machine and it worked fine. Charged the suspect battery and put it back into the device, the device wouldn't start, no fan-spin with or without battery connected.\n\nOrdered a replacement IO board on Amazon with free return, that didn't solve the issue.\n\nEnded up ordering a logic board off eBay and that solved the problem.\n\nPerhaps if I ever get some time I'll look into the board and actually figure out what went wrong.\n\nDon't like leaving forum posts open ended  so just wanted to post what ended up solving it."
