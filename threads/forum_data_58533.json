Of course the GPU will not work when <RESISTOR>R8911</RESISTOR> is removed. The thing is that <RESISTOR>R8911</RESISTOR> was removed by someone that kind of knew what they were doing so the GPU is suspect.\nIf CPU Vcore is present that means that all the rest of the power rails that are important are good. From this point on I do not know if these 17\" boards require the GPU to be present to at least give a \"no RAM\" beep. Stick 1 stick of RAM in the first slot and connect a USB mouse. Does the mouse light up? Boot is slow on these boards so give it a minute. These boards take PC8500 RAM."
