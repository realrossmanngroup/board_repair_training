        "ISL9239": "What is ISL9239? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2016-2018 responsible for charging the battery and creating the power rail PPBUS_G3H.",
        "820-00281": "What is 820-00281? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
