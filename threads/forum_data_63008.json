        "message":"I have a iPad 8th gen,  A2270 and some monster pulled a few pads off trying to replace home button zif connector. I started scraping to see if I can follow the traces. They are not clearly seen through the mask like I see some show.\n\nDidn't want to start tearing all the mask off, and figure someone has seen this. Do we know where these traces go to ? Does it even use all the traces? iPad 8 seems to be the only ipad I don't have info on. Here is a pic of what I have under the microscope."

Purchased ZXW to confirm pin location to components. They ohm out, so I may just have lucked out being able to repair.  I'll double check with what you sent.\n\n Again thanks !"
