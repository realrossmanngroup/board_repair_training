        "A2159": "What is A2159? A2159 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2019 with EMC 3301, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01598..",
        "820-01598": "What is 820-01598? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8400": "What is U8400? a CHIP.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SDA": "What is BKLT_SDA? BKLT_SDA is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT_F": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT_F? a SIGNAL."
