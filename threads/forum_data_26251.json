Also some damage around <CAPACITOR>C7555</CAPACITOR>, <CHIP>U9500</CHIP> and burnt BKL pins on LCD connector. Replaced ISL, <CAPACITOR>C7555</CAPACITOR> area, LCD connector and cleaned up <CHIP>U9500</CHIP> area. Now it turns on and chimes, but no video. Using known good LCD and cable. External video is working.\n\npn 2&3 of J900 - 0V /Diode - .445\npn 4 - 3.3V\n\n\nU900\nPIN 2&3 - 3.3V\nPIN 1- .012 V / Diode - . 410\n\nThanks. Have a good one!"
