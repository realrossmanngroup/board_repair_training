            "message": "Hello. I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that has no liquid damage, but was not turning on. I was getting 20v and amps fluctuating up to .700ma and then back down to 0.03a. The ports on the right side of the mac did not work at all and gave me 0v on my meter. I checked those ports and found a short on <SIGNAL>USBC_TB_CC1</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>USBC_TA_CC1</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>USBC_TA_CC2</SIGNAL>. I replaced UB300/400 with new chips I got on eBay and then I was getting 5v 0.27a on all 4 ports. I decided to try it with a charged battery and got it to turn on with the battery connected and it boots to the OS, but charger is not detected. Amp meter shows 20v 0.03a on all 4 ports when the board is on and booted with the battery connected. <SIGNAL>UPC_I2C_INT_L</SIGNAL> is always 0v, which I think is why the charger is not being detected. It is 1.8v on a good board. <RESISTOR>R5246</RESISTOR> is good. Doing more research I found this [URL]https://logi.wiki/index.php/CD3217_and_T2_Power_on_Sequence#820-001700_CD3217_Compatibility_issues[/URL] which seems to indicated that some <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> chips are not compatible with this board. I then tried to take good 2 <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> chips from a 2019 <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01598</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> donor board and reballed them and replaced UB300/400 again, but I still have the same issue. I even tried a T2 firmware restore and it completed successfully, but did not fix the issue. What should I check next?"

I took all 4 <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> chips from this donor board and used them to replace all 4 CD3217s on the board I am working on. I also took both TBT rom chips from the donor board and swaped them on my board. So now I have a full set of compatiable <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s and matching TBT roms, but I am still getting 5v 0.27a on all 4 ports without the battery and it still turns on only using a battery. I tried to do another DFU restore, but I cannot because now it seems I have no USB activity on any ports. I can tell the mac is in DFU mode based on the amps its taking, there is not communication over the tunderbolt cable, so nothing comes up on the other computer and I cannot do the restore. When the computer is on a booted, USB drive is not detected on 3 of the 4 ports, and one ports give me an error that it needs power.\n[ATTACH]60851[/ATTACH]"

Hopefully it helps someone else. \n\nI tried multiple different <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s from multiple different donor boards, and none of them seemed to work. I was always getting 5v 0.27a on all 4 ports using just the charger, but it turns on using battery. Out of desperation, I put all 4 of the original <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s back on the board (including the 2 bad UB300 and UB400 chips) and put the original TBT rom's back as well. Now I was back to where I started with the board giving me 20v now and up to .700ma before it turns itself off. In this state, it does not turn on even with the battery, but I do get 20v and the battery will charge now. This confirms the issue is with the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>â€™s I was using. It seems the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s I used are not compatible with this board, although I do not really know how to tell which ones are and which are not. I purchased 2 <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s online that were specifically said to be compatible with an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2141</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, and replaced UB300 and UB400 again with these 2 new chips. After that I was still getting only 5v 0.27a on all 4 ports, but this time the ports on the UB300/400 side were power cycling every 5 seconds or so. I suspected and issue with UB090 so I took UB090 off of a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> donor board and flashed it with the correct firmware for an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2141</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, and then replaced UB090 on this board with that one. Now I finally got 20v using just the charger and the board turns on without the battery. Now everything seems to working correctly."
