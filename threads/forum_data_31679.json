I fixed display issue.\nI already replaced battery and port they are fine. \nOnce i connecting  charger to the laptop orange light came up but in system laptop shows information battery is not charging.\nI measure voltage around port connector and compare to second laptop with is charging fine on diode <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> pin PPVIN i have only 0,6V , working one have 12V.\nAny idea where I should start with it? \nThanks"
