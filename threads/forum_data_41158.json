        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15” Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",
        "PPVCORE_S0_AXG": "What is PPVCORE_S0_AXG? This is vcore going to the CPU’s integrated graphics processor for CPUs that have an integrated GPU. When this is missing on a device that has an integrated GPU and no discrete GPU, it usually means either no screen is detected, or the GPU integrated into the CPU is dead..",
        "GPUVCORE_EN": "What is GPUVCORE_EN? GPUVCORE_EN enables GPU VCORE when it is high, a power rail necessary for the GPU to function so you can get an image on the screen. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

            "message": "I got this board witch has been messed with a little...It got a sticker with (bad video card/Bios)\nHopefully GPU has not been reflowed.\nI took a look at it and here is my findings:\n\nInitially quarter fan spin...nothing to do with charging sense resistor\nL3508 completely burned...but thats not a big deal.\nWrong 2011 lcd plugged in...\nLooked for knocked off component and found <RESISTOR>R8802</RESISTOR> in another position! between <RESISTOR>R8802</RESISTOR> pin1 and <CAPACITOR>C8823</CAPACITOR> pin 1. <RESISTOR>R8802</RESISTOR> pin 2 was not anymore connected.\n\nCorrected all this stuff and still board with all signals power cycling...\n\nDecided to quickly test a bios from same donnor board and actually it chimes! but still no video! Usb mouse with red light.\n\n<CHIP>U8900</CHIP> had very bad looking original solder joints. I decided let's touch up and reflow all the solder joint, It looks really great but nothing changed, still no video...\n\nTried some PRAM and checked for image but nothing.\n\nThen I thought maybe bios should have it's original ME, so I tried a backup from the original bios and it's not detected by programmer. When I solder back bad original bios chip it has same diode mode reading than the donnour testing one...\nActually it looks like it does'nt turn on but no short!! When I remove original bios it doesn't change anything, it continue power cycling.\n\nIs it worth spending time for this? If so how can I confirm if it's a bad ME bios chip causing that or a bad <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>?\n\nNote: I confirmed <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> is receiving <SIGNAL>GPUVCORE_EN</SIGNAL> 3.3V and <SIGNAL>GPUVCORE_PGOOD</SIGNAL> at 3.3V. Found also <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL> to be 0,89V, so it looks very likely that <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> is working properly.\n\nThanks for any advice"
