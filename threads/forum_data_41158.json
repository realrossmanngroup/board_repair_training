R8802 pin 2 was not anymore connected.\n\nCorrected all this stuff and still board with all signals power cycling...\n\nDecided to quickly test a bios from same donnor board and actually it chimes! but still no video! Usb mouse with red light.\n\nU8900 had very bad looking original solder joints. I decided let's touch up and reflow all the solder joint, It looks really great but nothing changed, still no video...\n\nTried some PRAM and checked for image but nothing.\n\nThen I thought maybe bios should have it's original ME, so I tried a backup from the original bios and it's not detected by programmer. When I solder back bad original bios chip it has same diode mode reading than the donnour testing one...\nActually it looks like it does'nt turn on but no short!! When I remove original bios it doesn't change anything, it continue power cycling.\n\nIs it worth spending time for this? If so how can I confirm if it's a bad ME bios chip causing that or a bad U8900?\n\nNote: I confirmed U8900 is receiving GPUVCORE_EN 3.3V and GPUVCORE_PGOOD at 3.3V. Found also PPVCORE_S0_AXG to be 0,89V, so it looks very likely that U8900 is working properly.\n\nThanks for any advice"}
