Seems like decided to die out of nowhere\nI can feel the board warms up such as its working but no fanspin or USB activity.\n\nNot sure in what order to provide readings so just grabbed an example from other posts. Let me know if you like me to provide more\n\nPP3V3_S0 = 3.3V\nPP5V_S0 = 5.16V\nSMC_PM_G2_EN = 3.41v\nPP5VP3V3_VREF2 = 2.02v\nPM_SLP_BUF_L = 3.3V\nP1V8S3_PGOOD = 0.186V\nP5VS4RS3_PGOOD = 0.186V\nP1V05S0_PGOOD = 0.186V\nALL_SYS_PWRGD = 0.186V\nP5VS0_EN = 3.3V\nP3V3S0_EN = 3.3V\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 3.349V\n\nHaven't seen anything like this.\nAny input would be appreciated.\n\nCheers"}

Thank you very much.\n\nP1V8S3_PGOOD - after R8166 removed and line was fluctuating around 0.5V\nP5VS4RS3_PGOOD - after R8165 removed and line was fluctuating around 0.5V\nP1V05S0_PGOOD - After R8164 removed the fan spins. Resoldered it back all working. \n\nNot sure what have caused it but u7600 seems to be okay. I wonder why it was not sending PGOOD signal and instead was pulling ALL_SYS_PWRGD down. it had around 0.3Vdc\n\n\nThanks again."}
