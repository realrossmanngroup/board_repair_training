After that the device did turn on. but only in smc bypass mode.\nif i try it to boot normally it show me battery low symbol. I have already tried a new battery. \nPPBUS_G3H with battery only connected is only 3V.\nBoth I2C lines (SDA\/SDC) from battery connector show almost same dioode mode reaeding (approx 0.3V)\nwhat could be the issue here? the cd3215 chips ??"
