The short is actually gone now and board is currently working again.\n\nYesterday I had confirmed with two different meters that it was short at around 1 ohm.\n\nThen I attempted  to use DC power supply to heat up the short.  I limited it to around 1.5A touched the short.  \n\nNOTHING happened.  Power supply didn't budge. No fan, no noise, no spark and no amperage.  It was like my power supply wasn't connected at all.\n\nI was confused about what was happening so I checked for the short again.  Now it's gone.\n\nDid the short burn out instantly when DC power was connected?  Like a small fleck of solder maybe?"
