    "definitions": {
        "820-2850": "What is 820-2850? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",
        "U3301": "What is U3301? a CHIP.",
        "820-2530": "What is 820-2530? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP4V4W_G3H": "What is PP4V4W_G3H? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_CELL": "What is CHGR_CELL? CHGR_CELL is a signal going to the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 battery charging chip that sets PPBUS_G3H voltage. Macbook Airs with 2 cells in series  in their batteries will have PPBUS_G3H voltages of 8.15v to 8.55v, Macbooks & Macbook Pros with 3 cells in series in their batteries will have PPBUS_G3H voltages of 12.23 to 12.56v..",
        "CHRGR_CELL": "What is CHRGR_CELL? a SIGNAL.",
        "820-32115": "What is 820-32115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state."
