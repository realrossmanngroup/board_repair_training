Stuck at 5V from charger and 0.31A\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> at 2.2V\n\nLDOs on every <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> was OK.\n\nInjected 3.5V and SMC was getting hot.\nDid just a SMC reflow and had 20V, Apple logo progress bar and then shut down and 20V and 0.01A from charger.\n\nAfter short time came back to 5V from charger, warm SMC and 2.4V on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>.\n\nCan I replace SMC in that model? Or any other ideas\n\nThanks"
