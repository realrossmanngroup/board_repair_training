If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."

Display doesnt light up, there is 8.57v on the fuse but not boosting, but display not turning on at all so it seems. Tried PRAM reset nothing happens. Tried to boot with external drive on external display, nothing happening. External drive and mouse have led activity.\n\nHistory was I repaired it about a month ago, short on <CAPACITOR>C7319</CAPACITOR> but that looks all good, no short and power is working."

As for display circuit no voltages, only get 8.59 on fuse but voltage for J8300, 3, 4, 14, 15, 16, 18/19 all 0. Cannot find any shorts in display circuit, seems its not turning on? Should have at least 8.59 on pin 3-4 i guess unless the line is broken, but no short."
