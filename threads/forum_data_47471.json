If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

Resoldered <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>, external display is back; however, I could see image just no backlight. Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C9712</CAPACITOR>/3 (ended up the culprits), and backlight came back. However, I get no video on the screen on the internal display. When you hit the power button, you immediately get no image but backlight. After 3 seconds, it chimes and boots externally while the internal screen flashes once and then does nothing. Tried known good display same thing. All of the filters between the <SIGNAL>DP_INT</SIGNAL> measure fine (F9000/1/2/3). I do get volts to the screen and I obviously now have backlight. Any ideas??? This one is weird never seen this issue before. I also don't have a USB light on the main board USB port, but I do on the RIO port."

Also compare diode values for data lines on eDP to working board; I've seen a few of these (drops I believe) that had open data lines (and sadly were not repaired). With these symptoms, you should be able to find something off in the diode readings. Make absolutely sure all filters working well; they can be bad but have continuity (rarely--they break super cleanly).\n\nUSB not working is odd and may not be related, but \"might\" hint at a BIOS/ME issue. Could also be SMC or MUX related; check and make sure there's no crack/break in the board near I/O ports. Of course, lots of lines there, and cracked PCB will cause funky issues due to internal shorting."
