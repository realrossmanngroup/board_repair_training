        "message":"what about 10 minutes? I mean, i did 30 min on some PC Notebook boards (believe me, German beer is almost impossible to remove with alcohol\/glass cleaner\/acetone\/Amtech flux). Is there something special about macbook boards?\n\nas for keyboard, i had 2 successful cleaning with alcohol bath, it was also around 30 mins distilled water with regular movent and rotation, then again isopropyl bath and 30 min 80\u00b0c hot air. did it only because i was not really in the mood to drill 100 nuts just to fix 2 keys. I guess this method works only if you have a random key(s) failure. if it is the line in matrix, you're almost certainly wasting your time. \n\nAlso, Vertyanov IC programmer is extremely handy for keyboard diagnostics."
