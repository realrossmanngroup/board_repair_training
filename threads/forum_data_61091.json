            "message": "Hello guys. This board came to me with no life. Someone had already poked around it. I reballed SMC, replaced battery current sensing resistors and board started. It does not see HDD though. Replaced cable with known good one, still same. Mesauring around I found <RESISTOR>R4535</RESISTOR> was bad so I replaced it. Same result. I decided then just to replace all caps (<CAPACITOR>C4510</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C4511</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C4515</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C4516</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C4534</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C4533</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C4514</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C4519</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C4535</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C4536</CAPACITOR>) still same. Replaced <CHIP>U4510</CHIP>, still same. Chip is getting power on VDD. EN signal is around 1,5V, which I think is low. Tried forcing it to 3.3V via jumper wire, but it still does not see the drive. What else could I verify before declaring dead PCH?"
