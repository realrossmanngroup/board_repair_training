        "A1398": "What is A1398? A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",

It shows the trace from keyboard connector , stops,  and a crap load of numbers ?
