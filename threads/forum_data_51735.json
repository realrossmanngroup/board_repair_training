Can I remove L7520 and inject voltage here to find a short? I checked this vs 5 other working machines and found that the short I am getting is an abnormal condition. This is not a customer machine BTW, just an experimental project of mine. This is by far the most interesting issue I have ran into so I am pursuing it for the understanding and education."

Doesn't help that I am now using a bent nozzle when I am used to straight ones. Before I took it off I noticed the that the goo on the corners of the SMC was brown like someone burned it. I'll try injecting voltage starting at 1v. This should be fun...my thinking is that this board has more than one issue. I can definitely tell it has been messed with before. The hold down tab on the keyboard connector is gone & the battery connector is a little melted. Like someone baked the board. This came out of a MBA that someone gave to me as they bought a new machine so if I mess up I am not out any money but if I manage to get somewhere I got priceless knowledge!"
