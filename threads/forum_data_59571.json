I bought this A1502 13\" late 2013 retina which has a super weird issue! It works just fine for a while but after like 30 minutes it cuts out and sometimes won't power up until you let it sit for a while. I already ruled out the battery and thermal issues.\nAnyone know what could be causing this?"}

Also Apple services aren\u2019t working, but that\u2019s likely just a product of the different BIOS. This is honestly one of my most annoying machines I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026"}

Bt apple services are still an issue. Well at least FaceTime and iMessage. I tried both my old install and also a fresh install I put on an external SSD. What happens is with iMessage I can sign in like normal but after like 10s I get thrown into the login screen again... For FaceTime it does a similar thing where I log in but it just goes back to the login screen. In terms of stability, I can't really comment on it but it seems fine for now. Oh, and I did a PRAM reset."}
