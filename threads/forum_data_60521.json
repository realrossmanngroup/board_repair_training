        "message":"Hi again.\nI have a 820-00165 that came in with a very small amount of water damage, but very little sign of corrosion.\n\nOriginally completely dead, but I found a tiny amount of corrosion on J9500, specifically around pin 19 SYS_ONEWIRE.\n\nI cleaned and reflowed, then added some enamel wire and successfully fixed the onewire break...\n\nI now have the Onewire LED on charger, but still no fan.\n\nSMC reset changes LED colour from orange to green, then back to orange, correctly.\n\nPPDCIN_G3H seems a bit low at 15.07, but is the same with two known good genuine chargers.\nI also tried with another power daughterboard and flex cable that connects to J9500, with no change.\n\nPPBUS_G3H, PPBUS_S5_HS_Computing_ISNS and PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS all 8.61v\nPP3V42_G3H 3.42v\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.34v\nPP5V_S5 5.03v\nPP3V3_S5 3.35\n\nPM_BATLOW_L 3.3v\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN 3.43v\nPM_DSW_PWRGD 3.43v\nPCH_DSWVRMEN 3.23v\nPM_RSMRST_L 0v\nPM_PWRBTN_L 1.01v\n\nAny suggestions greatly appreciated."
