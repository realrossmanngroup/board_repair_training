After looking around the board some I see signs of corrosion that tells the story that most likely the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> pin on the speaker connector shorted out the whole rail as there is power to the SSD Switch for <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL> but no <SIGNAL>3V3_S0</SIGNAL>. Is there a good place to start looking, currently I'm just going by testing nasty looking components on the rail."
