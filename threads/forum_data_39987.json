After this the board don't start anymore !! already replace U7501 for new on and same history, no fan!! \n\ni already double inspect and don't found more humidity !!! \n\nppbus, PP3V42_G3H , PPVRTC_G3H, PP5V_S5, PP5V_S4RS3 - ALL OK  \n\n MC_ADAPTER_EN, PM_BATLOW_L, SMC_PM_G2_EN, SMC_RESET_L. - ALL OK \n\nonly don't have PP5V_S0 !! \n\nany idea???"}
