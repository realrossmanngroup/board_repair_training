Checked all the common issues for no audio, but found <SIGNAL>HDA_SDOUT</SIGNAL> shorted (.000) at J9500. Since this comes from the CPU, I suspect a CPU fault and nowhere else to go. Removed <RESISTOR>R1313</RESISTOR> and found <SIGNAL>HDA_SDOUT_R</SIGNAL> shorted to ground, which goes to CPU.\n\nIs this one done?"
