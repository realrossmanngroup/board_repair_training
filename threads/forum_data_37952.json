The screen suddenly became black and now it's still black. The computer is fine to plug into external monitor so I think just the screen is the problem.\nAlso the screen is fine if not open more than 30 degree angle so I suspect it's a connection problem.\"\n\nReplacing the display fixes the issue but I am wondering what is the issue here, some sensor or cable crack issue? Anyone knows? It looks like its gonna be yet another recall for these pieces of crap."
