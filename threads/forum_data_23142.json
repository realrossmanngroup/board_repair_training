        "message":"Hello,\n\nMacbook had corrosion on or near internal dp connector and J4700. Cleaned up pins of J4700. Replaced edp connector with a new part. Macbook boots and shows external display, all seems to be working except for internal display.\n\nIs not a backlight issue, checked for image and tested with known good display.\n\nChecked smc_lid, 3.4 volts and voltage drops when magnet is applied to the lid switch.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks!"
