Macbook boots and shows external display, all seems to be working except for internal display.\n\nIs not a backlight issue, checked for image and tested with known good display.\n\nChecked <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL>, 3.4 volts and voltage drops when magnet is applied to the lid switch.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks!"
