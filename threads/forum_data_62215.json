Output headphone is ok.\n\n<SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> = low, diodemode is 0,512\n<SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> = low, diodemode is 0,002\n\nI removed <CHIP>U6400</CHIP>, <CAPACITOR>C6103</CAPACITOR> and the flexcabel to the audioboard. J6100 and all traces looks good.\nSo i think the short of <SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> is probably inside T2, what do yout think?\n\nCould it be a solution, setting <SIGNAL>SPKRAMP_RESET_L</SIGNAL> high with an jumperwire?"
