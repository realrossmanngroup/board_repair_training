I get HDD working for a 10-15 min after replacement and issue come back. The machine come here with this problem not recognising HDD with was looking like dead HDD. \nReplaced HDD twice for brand new \nreplaced hdd data cable \nreplaced the 4 caps C3821, C3822,c3823,c3824 suspecting issue there same issue persist \nI've measure the other connector J3830 \nPP5V_S0_HDD -- 5V present \nSMC_OOB1_R2D_R_L -- 3.3V \nHDD_OOB1_D2R_L -- 0.013v jumping to 0.023V \n\nThanks for help"}

Also after fitting PCH there is a resistance on all 4 caps from PCH side. \nAny more ideas ?\n I am thinking about reball SMC.\nIt looks like loose connection after warming up board it started working? What do you think about SMC reball?\nDo you think this value is correct ? HDD_OOB1_D2R_L -- 0.013v jumping to 0.023V"}
