Also after fitting PCH there is a resistance on all 4 caps from PCH side. \nAny more ideas ?\n I am thinking about reball SMC.\nIt looks like loose connection after warming up board it started working? What do you think about SMC reball?\nDo you think this value is correct ? <SIGNAL>HDD_OOB1_D2R_L</SIGNAL> -- 0.013v jumping to 0.023V"
