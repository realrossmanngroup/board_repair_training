I have changed the LCD cable with a known LCD cable, a known good working LCD, and I changed the LCD connector despite it looking good. I also checked for continuity between J8500 and <DIODE>D8410</DIODE> and it's there. \n\nI'm fresh out of ideas and was looking for another opinion in case I'm missing something or if someone had the same issue and maybe a solution.\n\nThanks for your help."
