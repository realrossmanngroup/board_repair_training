This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad..",

This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad. Each CD3215 in the system needs to be functioning in order for any of them to speak to the charger and negotiate receiving 20v from the charger rather than the default 5v that a USB-C charger puts out before communicating with the system. .",
