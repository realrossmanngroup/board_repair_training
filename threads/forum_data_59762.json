With customer SSD booting up but crashing and restarting.\nI've tried a new ssd but didn't get chance to install fresh osx because is not possible \nI refresh BIOS no changes \ntest AHT no errors found \nLooks like some temperature sensor but there is no schematic so can't even see where they are. \nI tried with disconnected camera no results.\nDoes anyone had issue like this before ?\nthanks for help"
