If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

The machine is turning on as all powerstates are there including S0 and cpu gets warm and has power. Display is missing backlight power as well as 5V, 3.3v is present. <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> has 8.6v on pin 3/4 and on the otherside once i got 8.6 and mostly 0.44v. For <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL>, which is 0v, as well as <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> the enable signals are 0v. Any idea how to troubleshoot this piece of junk :)?"

Had another couple of these that were crippled by the keyboard and tpad. \nif you get image, shut down and plug things in one at a time. See what prevents it from working.**make sure to disconnect the batt each time**. \n\nLet me know now what you find. Seeing a lot of this similar issue on these."
