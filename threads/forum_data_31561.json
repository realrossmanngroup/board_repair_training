There was remanence of corrosion on the bios on pins 7 and 8. Touched up soldering and have continuity from pins 7 and 8 to their corresponding spots. Measured around a bit and noticed PPVRTC_G3H would kind of jump between 3.3 and 3.42. Replaced clock chip now only goes to 3.3 like normal, but it still refuses to start. It doesn't quickly quarter spin but rather it will do the on off on off on thing like 3437's normally do; however, it never stops going on off on off. Could this be a result of crap under a chip like the SMC or where should I look next? The termination resistors around the bios look pretty normal like no burning but have not measured them yet. JTAG looks clean as can be."}
