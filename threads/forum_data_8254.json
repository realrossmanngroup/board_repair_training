Previous company tried a repair was not successful.\n\nU7000 area was badly damaged, replaced, made jumpers, and repaired the area Computer worked passed system checks, so I sent it out. \n\nMonth later computer comes back wont boot normally. SMC bypass it will boot. \n\nMain power rails are there. Charger light changes green to orange as normal. Just will not boot from normal power button press.\n\nAnyone have an idea of where I should look because Im lost as of right now. \n\n3v42 present\nPP BUSG3H present\n3v3S5 present"
