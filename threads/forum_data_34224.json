        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PPCHGR_DCIN": "What is PPCHGR_DCIN? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "U6990": "What is U6990? a CHIP.",
        "R6990": "What is R6990? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on Macbooks from around the year 2012. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_ACOK": "What is CHGR_ACOK? This is identical to SMC_BC_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  ."
