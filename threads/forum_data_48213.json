No shorts on any of those lines, and PPBUS_G3H descends constantly from around ~200mv but jumps every few seconds to around ~350mv and straight back down to continue descending, while 3V42 is constant at 17mv, no jumps. Have to run, but any symptoms sound familiar to you guys? Will test any more rails I need to once I get back, may be tomorrow tho."}

Either way, after replacing I now have stable DCIN rails, 3V42 and PPBUS_G3H are 3.44v and 12.56v respectively. The resistors you mentioned all returned normal values, plus current sensing is fine as well.\nONEWIRE and ADAPTER_SENSE are ~1.49v. No shorts on those lines. U6900\/01 look fine, should try replacing anyway? Already replaced ISL earlier no change."}
