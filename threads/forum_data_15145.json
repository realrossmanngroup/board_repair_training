Was cleaned already with US\nNow it power and work ok only if CPU is hot. First time I turn it on it power and I have CPU core, CPU warm but no mouse and no video. If I have it 2 minutes working and then remove power and turn it again it will work now. I can turn it on and off many times and it will work every time. Only if I wait 10-15 minutes and board became cold it will not power anymore with video but CPU core is present always. Already checked bios area and seems ok."}

No way to tell what is going on with this board. I more suspect a corroded trace or resistor."}
