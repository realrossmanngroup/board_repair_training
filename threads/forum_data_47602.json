            "message": "Now I know I am going to get ribbed... so here goes. I am trying to deduce this with through logic but not getting it right, i don't think.\nAbove board.... magsafe charger goes from green to orange... indicates <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is present. Hopefully I have that right. Board is not powering on. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is showing 1.3v and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> shows 3.402v. So, issue is more than likely <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> as I believe it should be 8.4v. Looking at the schematic, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> comes out from F7040. Pins 1 and 2 show the voltage there as being 1.3v Taking steps back next point is L7030 which reads 1.299v on both pins 1 and 2 ( ignoring the minor difference in the voltage). Step back again to <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>, pin 7 appears to be in <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> but pin 1 on L7030 looks like it is directly linked to pin 23 on <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Pin 19 VDD is reading 5.067v so i know that is getting power and pin 20 is get 5.064v, thus meaning <RESISTOR>R7001</RESISTOR> is doing its job. back to <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>, pins 3/4/5 are GND. Pin 1 <SIGNAL>CHGR_UGATE</SIGNAL> is showing 1.299v. Pin 6 <SIGNAL>CHGR_LGATE</SIGNAL> is showing 0.0v. Pin 2 <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR</SIGNAL> is showing 14.8v, which is the same voltage at pins 2 & 4 on j6900. pin 3 reads 3.304v which if i am correct in thinking should be 5v??? Now here is the kicker.... when in diode mode, reading <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> at any of the points shown on the NET command on openboardview for a short to ground I am getting 0.0 ohms and a constant beep. Which again if i am right indicates a short. But nothing is getting hot.\n\nNext logical step for me is to grab a bench PSU, of which i do not have at this time, inject say 3v into <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> say at pin 2 on F7040 and obviously blk to GND and see what gets hot then... correct?\nOr is all that I have done above, over complicated things and it is either <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> or <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> thats the issue?\n\nThanks for any input given...:o:o:o"
