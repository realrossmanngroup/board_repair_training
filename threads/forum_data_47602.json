I am trying to deduce this with through logic but not getting it right, i don't think.\nAbove board.... magsafe charger goes from green to orange... indicates PPBUS_G3H and PP3v42_G3H is present. Hopefully I have that right. Board is not powering on. PPBUS_G3H is showing 1.3v and PP3v42_G3H shows 3.402v. So, issue is more than likely PPBUS_G3H as I believe it should be 8.4v. Looking at the schematic, PPBUS_G3H comes out from F7040. Pins 1 and 2 show the voltage there as being 1.3v Taking steps back next point is L7030 which reads 1.299v on both pins 1 and 2 ( ignoring the minor difference in the voltage). Step back again to Q7030, pin 7 appears to be in Q7030 but pin 1 on L7030 looks like it is directly linked to pin 23 on U7000. Pin 19 VDD is reading 5.067v so i know that is getting power and pin 20 is get 5.064v, thus meaning R7001 is doing its job. back to q7030, pins 3\/4\/5 are GND. Pin 1 CHGR_UGATE is showing 1.299v. Pin 6 CHGR_LGATE is showing 0.0v. Pin 2 PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR is showing 14.8v, which is the same voltage at pins 2 & 4 on j6900. pin 3 reads 3.304v which if i am correct in thinking should be 5v??? Now here is the kicker.... when in diode mode, reading PPBUS_G3H at any of the points shown on the NET command on openboardview for a short to ground I am getting 0.0 ohms and a constant beep. Which again if i am right indicates a short. But nothing is getting hot.\n\nNext logical step for me is to grab a bench PSU, of which i do not have at this time, inject say 3v into PPBUS_G3H say at pin 2 on F7040 and obviously blk to GND and see what gets hot then... correct?\nOr is all that I have done above, over complicated things and it is either U7000 or Q7030 thats the issue?\n\nThanks for any input given...:o:o:o"}

F7040 removed. Pin 2 still shows a short using diode mode. pins 1 and 2 on L7030 still show 1.3v. Pin 1 on D6905 shows short. pin2&3 do not show short. If I remove D6905 the short on pin 1 of D6905\/ pin 1&2 of r6906 and pin 2 of F7040 show no short. With D6905 removed there is no short on any of the pins.
