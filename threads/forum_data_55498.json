        "message":"Hi all, firstly Happy New Year to you all.\nSecondly, I have this ongoing problem with an A1502. Unless an orginal battery ( factory fitted) is put into this MBP, it fails to charge any other battery I put in. I have used 6 batteries from different suppliers and none will charge. But as soon as I fit and original battery charges and works fine.\nQuestion is, has anybody swapped the board on an orginal battery to the cells from a \" Genuine OEM\" battery? Battery count is not an issue where as the power life span is.\nAny one attempted this or is able to point me in the direction of a supplier of an A1502 battery that is as close to an original as can be.\nMany thanks.\nMarc"
