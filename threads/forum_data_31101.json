Orange and green light present. Fan starts to spin, stops after 10-15 seconds and then starts again and keeps spinning. I have 3.3v on both <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> and <CHIP>U6100</CHIP>. 25 and 36mhz coming from the clock chip, CPU gets hot but still not booting. Also have a mouse lighting up on USB. Thoughts?"
