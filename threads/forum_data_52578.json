        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "SMC_RSMRST_L": "What is SMC_RSMRST_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running.."
