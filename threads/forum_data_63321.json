After replacing both <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> chips and still getting 5V 0.016A I checked the surrounding caps around them and found CF400/CF500 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2</SIGNAL> low at .560V. On further inspection I found a burnt coil L8300 which I replaced with a 30Ohm coil (all I had similar) to get 3.7V from <SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON_VDDMAIN</SIGNAL> to <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> <SIGNAL>MPMU_BSTLQ_LX</SIGNAL>. Power was briefly at 5V 0.450A but has dropped to 5V 0.016A and I'm not sure where to look next."
