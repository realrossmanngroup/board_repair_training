I opened it up and found almost no corrosion except on some caps. \n\nC78B7, C78B6 traces of corrosion, almost nothing to be concerned for.\nPin 12 of J6700 connector was a little burned, but seems fine\nChecked other parts of the board.. nothing.\n\nAll VCores show 0.65 - 0.7 volts. Fan spins when CPU gets hot. I am able to turn off and on using power button. Amp meter shows 0.28 - 0.32 amps coming from type C charger with battery connected.\n\nI tried connecting to Apple Configurator 2 for the first time, but my MacBook doesn't seem to see it.\n\nAny advice?"
