        "message":"I'm working on a 820-3209 that shows orange light but no fan spin. I was able to find a short on PP15V_TBT. I relieved the short but still no signs of life. I have gone through the main voltages, s3,s5 and all of them are present. I notice the line PPVIN_SW_TBTBST is 2.5v instead of 12.8v. \n\nCould this be preventing boot up? Any suggestions?"
