            "message": "Hello,\n\nLogic board gets to S0 state but has generic SMC error.\nHWMonitor shows that heatpipe inlet temp and heatpipe outlet temp are 128C.\n\nInlet temp is <TRANSISTOR>Q5830</TRANSISTOR> attached to <CHIP>U5800</CHIP>, but does anyone know what sensor or bus heatpipe outlet temperature would be? Trying to find if there is a shared data line.\n\nThanks\n\nStefan\n\nEdit: Inlet temp is on SMC 1 dataline, and finstack is on SMC 2, so they don't share a data line. And finstack appears to be reporting correctly anyway.\nPull up resistors for SMBUS SMC 1 are OK, and it appears that the lines are varying in voltage like there is data (don't have oscilloscope unfortunately)."

Pull up resistors are in good shape as well. \nSensors <TRANSISTOR>Q5860</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q5810</TRANSISTOR> attatched to <CHIP>U5800</CHIP> are reporting normally.\nDiode mode measurements at pins 2 and 3 of <CHIP>U5800</CHIP> match my good working board.\nGor frustrated and cut traces at <CAPACITOR>C5801</CAPACITOR> and rebuilt temp sensor dead bug style near <CHIP>U5800</CHIP>, and verified it is connected according to the schematic, and still not reporting correctly.\nI'm stumped on this one. Could this be a SMC issue?"
