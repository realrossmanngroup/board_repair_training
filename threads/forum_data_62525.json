No waterdamage. When charging and with closed lid it will stop reponding to anything when open the lid it screen will remain black not action on touchbar. Sounds when connecting charger. No response to power button.\n\nOnly way to get it to work normal again is to disconnect battery and connect it back, then it will work normal. \n\nCharging with open lid works normal,\n\nSometimes it happens even without charger connected when it goes to sleep but very rarely"}
