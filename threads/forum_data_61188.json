        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",
        "PM_DSW_PWRGD": "What is PM_DSW_PWRGD? The \"PM_DSW_PWRGD\" signal in a MacBook stands for \"Deep Sleep Well Power Good” and is required for the machine to power on & post..",
        "PM_RSMRST_L": "What is PM_RSMRST_L? The \"PM_RSMRST_L\" signal, also known as \"Resume Reset,\" is an active-low signal that is part of the power management system in MacBooks. It asserts a reset signal when it is low voltage which is what the _L is for. Is the machine is in a reset stage it will not properly power on..",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "PCH_INTRUDER_L": "What is PCH_INTRUDER_L? PCH_INTRUDER_L is a signal that tells the machine the case has been opened by an intruder when it is low, the _L means it is present when it is low. This signal should always be high in a Macbook since it doesn’t use intrusion detection. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "PCH_SRTCRST_L": "What is PCH_SRTCRST_L? PCH_SRTCRST_L is a reset signal present for the RTC circuit that asserts when it is low in voltage, that is what _L means..",

            "message": "Hello. This board has turned into a real nightmare. Originally it came in with liquid damage and minor corrosion around <CHIP>U7650</CHIP>, <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> and <CHIP>U4200</CHIP>. Was only getting 5v and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground. I cleared the short by removing <CAPACITOR>C3100</CAPACITOR> and got 20v but only about 30ma. Was missing <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> and it was not shorted, so I replaced <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> and some components near it that were corroded and then I checked <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> again before powering the board and it was now shorted somehow. I went to remove <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> again, thinking it was causing the short, and after only like 10 seconds of heating it with my hot air station, I heard a loud pop noise so I stopped heating. When I flipped the board over, I saw the PCH die actually exploded somehow and a large chunk blew off from it. Weird because I was not even heating the board in that area. I removed the damaged PCH and the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> short was gone. I replaced it with a new PCH I bought on Aliexpress, but was still not turning on. I was not getting <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> and found it was because the trace was broken. I had to run a wire under <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> to reconnect that and now I have <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> and all S5 voltages, but missing <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>. I have since found more broken traces on <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, which I ran wires to fix. I'm sure I have another broken trace somewhere but I'm not sure where to look. I checked each of the signals below and they seem normal. What else is needed for <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>?\n\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> - 0 (Does not pulse when trigger)\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> - 0 (Does not pulse when trigger)\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> - 0 (Does not pulse when trigger)\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S0_L</SIGNAL> - 0 (Does not pulse when trigger)\n    \n<SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> - 3.3 (Does drop when trigger)\n<SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL> - 3.21 (No reaction when trigger)\n<SIGNAL>PM_DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL> - 3.3 \n<SIGNAL>RTC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 3.07\n<SIGNAL>PCH_SRTCRST_L</SIGNAL> - 3.07\n<SIGNAL>PCH_INTRUDER_L</SIGNAL> - 2.79\n<SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL> - 3.3\n<SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL> - 3.29"
