I have taken the board out plugged the charger in and it blows the p7 transistor on the dc in board, when the board is in the machine it dosnt show a light when plugged in and it dosnt blow the p7 , only when the board is out of the machine . works on battery with no backlight i can see the circle with a line through it on the screen."
