I don't have the expert knowledge that you do about every signal on the boards, if I did I wouldn't be posting here.\n\nIn [URL='https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3209</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a-<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>-2012.61132/#post-74995']this post[/URL] and [URL='https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3209</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a-<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>-2012.61132/#post-75001']this post[/URL] you listed out the signal names [B]without[/B] abbreviations and I was quick to find the values for you and there was no confusion from either party.\n\n[URL='https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1989</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a.61230/']In this post[/URL] I tried to make everything organized and clear for you, and it was an oversight to not list everything in the same order and you were quick to tell me otherwise, which is why in this current post I kept the AUX, <SIGNAL>AUX_DET</SIGNAL>  and Amon and Bmon together, to make sense because that's how you wanted in the past.\n\n[URL='https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>-no-battery.61266/']In this post[/URL] I tried to make it even more clear with tables to make your job easier and to help me easier/faster.\n\nThen I tried to explain to you I didn't understand which signals you wanted because you gave me [B]abbreviated[/B] \"SCL/SDA\" and I had to spend extra time just typing SCL and SDA into the board view but wasn't sure if <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL</SIGNAL> was what you wanted or if it was one of the other 10+ signals that have SCL and SDA in it\n\nThen you made this comment:\n\"No idea, looking at battery connector in schematic???\" \n\nDon't you think that's exactly what I was doing? I was in the board view and didn't understand which ones you specifically needed because, again, it was [B]abbreviated [/B]and not the exact signal or even close enough that I could get the right signal with confidence. Simply searching SCL or SDA returns a ton of signals.\n\nI'm not trying to make your job difficult[U][B] I greatly appreciate the work you do[/B][/U] for this forum and I envy your knowledge. But I would like some more patience from you because comments like:\n\n\"No idea, looking at battery connector in schematic??? \"\n \" You expect help, but you don't even take your time to properly write the signal names. \"\n\nare not necessary comments.\n\nI'm trying my best to comb through all the 40 pins on <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> to figure out what <SIGNAL>P_IN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>EN_VR1</SIGNAL> are so you can help me as quickly as possible.\n\nI understand the frustration you must encounter with all the posts on this forum, but I'm here to learn how to fix boards sir, this is my livelihood right now, I don't want to be belittled by your unnecessary comments, I'm learning."
