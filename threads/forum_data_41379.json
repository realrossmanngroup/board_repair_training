I tried witha replacment trackpad and cable to no avail. customer took the laptop to the apple store and they deduced it was the trackpad. however, when the customer got the laptop back theyn had charged for an OUT OF WARRANTY repar for a replacement logicboard. Not saying this is the issue here but might be worth considering.A lso the trackpad I was using was good but the cable bad.  Might be worth trying a 2nd known good 2015 trackpad and cable first."
