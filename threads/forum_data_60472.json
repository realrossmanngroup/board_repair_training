I measured power on  J4813 (keyboard connector):\n\n1.  PP3V42_G3H_TPAD is 3.4\n2.  PP3V3_S4_TPAD is 2.8v all across the rail. \n\nU4801 doesnt seem to be corroded or damaged. Im trying to figure out where is PP3V3_S4 created. I belive in  U1900 ?\n\nU1900 doesnt seem damaged also. But its measuring 1.1v on pin 14."}
