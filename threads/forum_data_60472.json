The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

I measured power on  J4813 (keyboard connector):\n\n1.  <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H_TPAD</SIGNAL> is 3.4\n2.  <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4_TPAD</SIGNAL> is 2.8v all across the rail. \n\n<CHIP>U4801</CHIP> doesnt seem to be corroded or damaged.
