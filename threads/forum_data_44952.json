It will install up to El Capitan with Rom Firmware of 112.0138. If you try to update to High Sierra it fails install stating there is missing files required to update. Ive also taken it to my local apple store across the street who works with me on a lot of things where he cant fix them and hes had the same issues. \n\nI assume this is a faulty Bios or something isnt allowing the Bios to update so I looked around on google and found the Firmware for 112.0142 which is the firmware revision High Sierra installs. Issue is Im having issues finding in the ROM where the SN and ME region go. \nFile is linked here for the firmware\n[url]https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1MOtE55s7vMB_rL7SR6EUiEDdEV1gTJkJ[\/url]"}

It may only be useful for updating the Bios. If anyone has a dump of 820-3787 on High Sierra it would be helpful."}

Sometimes the SSD shows up and sometimes it doesnt. \nSSD conn looks fine, no corrosion or broken pins. \n\nIm really lost at this point as to what is happening."}
