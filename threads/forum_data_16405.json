    "definitions": {
        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U7200": "What is U7200? a CHIP.",
        "U7941": "What is U7941? a CHIP.",
        "U4900": "What is U4900? This is the System Management Controller(SMC) in older(pre-2013) macbooks.",
        "SMC_G2_EN": "What is SMC_G2_EN? SMC_G2_EN is a typo of SMC_PM_G2_EN. If you see SMC_G2_EN assume the poster meant to type SMC_PM_G2_EN. SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "TPS51125": "What is TPS51125? This is a power chip responsible for the PP3V3_S5,  PP5V_S5,  and PP5V_S3 power rails on many A1278 model Macbooks."
