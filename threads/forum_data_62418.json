I got a healthy draw and a booting mac, although only with the battery disconnected.\n\nI had a bit more of a look around to see what was happening, looked for any other issue & found nothing.\n\nI then put it back together though this time it booted with the battery connected, except wasn't charging, and had the service battery message.\n\nTried a known good battery and same thing.\n\nI follow the battery connection on the schematic and found C6910 looked cooked - removed and the Mac wouldn't boot at all this time.\n\nReplaced that cap and she booted but back at no charging \/ service battery message.\n\nThought perhaps because C6910 was so cooked, I would try and replace U6903. Have0 idea what I've done because now it's stuck at 5v not drawing 20v and not booting :(\n\nI thought U7000 needs to talk to SMC to tell it to give 20v so maybe my issue is there. Though I don't want to keep playing chip of fortune.\n\nPM_EN_P3V3_G3H = 4.7v which means U7000is getting the power it needs to turn on right? \n\nAny advice is appreciated\n\nCheers."}
