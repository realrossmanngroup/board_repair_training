No green\/orange light, no fan spin, no warmth on CPU.\n\nIt draws 25mA from the charger hence I checked PM_SLP_S4_L, 3.1 mV\n\nPerformed the checks on repair.wiki:\n[LIST]\n[*]U1950 is corroded and you can't see it: it looks good I haven't removed it, no corrosion in the area.\n[*]Corrosion on probe points for SPI ROM U6100 area: very clean\n[*]Bad clock chip U1900: nothing visible\n[*]Corrosion on RTC pullup resistors R1300 to R1303 (or C1300\/C1303 shorted to ground): Both resistors measure 20K as expected, caps are not shorted\n[*]If you remove R8111 and PM_SLP_S4_L comes back: removed this resistor, no change on PM_SLP_S4_L, put it back.\n[\/LIST]\nC7583 was most impacted by corrosion, removed it and not yet replaced as it looked like the smallest of the 4 parallel resistors to ground on that line.\n\nFurther measurements:\n\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.42V\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.63V\nSMC_RESET_L is high\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3.433V\nRTC_RESET_L = 3.329V\nPHC_INTVRMEN = 3.324V\nPHC_DSWVRMEN = 3.336V\n\nthen PP3V3_S5 = 0.620V !\n\nTraced PP3V3_S5 back to Q7560 (hope this is correct), VIN is fine at 8.6V but VSW (pins 6\/7\/8) are 0.620V again.\n\nShould I suspect a faulty Q7560 or anything else I can check before changing it ? Just wanted to check I am not travelling too far in the wrong direction.\n\nEDIT: Moving onto U7501, PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS = 1.01V, instead of 8.6V, checking this rail now"}

Q7520 pin 1 is also 8.6v.\nThen C7500, pin 1 reads 1V.\n\nCorroded pads of C7583 (that was removed earlier) are pretty much right on the other side of C7500. It is a bit like 8.6v on the front of the board and 1V on the back. Could it be that one of the pads is actually a via and now acting as a resistor? I may just be making up things."}
