This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

            "message": "No backlight board, board came to me with liquid damage, however very minimal, and the spill seemed to have not contact anything critical.\n\nBacklight circuit has no damage, neither does display connector.\n\n0V on backlight output, started to diagnose with good working screen. I would get image, just no backlight. <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> would not open, 12.6V all across the board, <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> would not drop either. I was inspecting <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>, and <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR>, when I guess from me touching either one (not sure which) <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> had a fit, and literally caught fire, and exploded...\n\nThe 4 pads (6,5,1,2) are now exposed, and I can peel back that layer... edit (<CAPACITOR>C7701</CAPACITOR>, no stuff, pin 1 is gone)\n\nPretty f*kd. However testing with a multimeter shows no shorts, and continuity is still fine with those pads. Im almost certain I can repair this board, however Id really like some advice on how to proceed with this.\n\nMy questions are why did <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> just implode out of the blue and what could this mean. Everything else reads correctly compared to working board. Could L7710 be a culprit (although looks completely fine).\n\nFunniest part is that when I was testing this with my power supply, I saw the amperage spike to over 3.8A, shut it off, damage was done, and F7700 could not be bothered by this. Fuse is still good!"
