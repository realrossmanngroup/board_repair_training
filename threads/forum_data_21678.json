        "820-2330": "What is 820-2330? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "PP3V3_S5_REG": "What is PP3V3_S5_REG? PP3V3_S5_REG is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state. .",
        "U6915": "What is U6915? a CHIP.",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line..",

This doesn't provide power to the voltage divider at <RESISTOR>R6917</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R6918</RESISTOR> that allows the N channel <TRANSISTOR>Q6920</TRANSISTOR> to open. <TRANSISTOR>Q6920</TRANSISTOR> needs to open for <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> on the charger to talk to <SIGNAL>SYS_ONEWIRE</SIGNAL> at the SMC to get a green light.\n\n<SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> is about 2.9v data line. The entire point of this circuit is to turn off the path between the charger and the SMC(<TRANSISTOR>Q6920</TRANSISTOR>) if <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> voltage is too high because someone is plugging the charger in drunk and messing up the pins or the DC in board dies and has 16v main DC voltage on the <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> dataline."
