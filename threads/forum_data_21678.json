        "message":"What resistance do you measure between pins 1 and 2 of Q6910?\n\nWhat voltage do you get on pins 5 & 2 of Q6920 with charger plugged in?\n\nWhat voltage do you get on pin 5 of Q6915 with charger plugged in?\n\nTypically, Q6910\/Q6915\/U6915 all go bad in tandem. Q6910 internally shorts pin 1 to 2 and dies, which keeps it stuck in \"off\" mode - as a P channel it won't open unless pin 2(gate) is LOWER in voltage than pin 1(source). This doesn't provide power to the voltage divider at R6917 and R6918 that allows the N channel Q6920 to open. Q6920 needs to open for ADAPTER_SENSE on the charger to talk to SYS_ONEWIRE at the SMC to get a green light.\n\nADAPTER_SENSE is about 2.9v data line. The entire point of this circuit is to turn off the path between the charger and the SMC(Q6920) if ADAPTER_SENSE voltage is too high because someone is plugging the charger in drunk and messing up the pins or the DC in board dies and has 16v main DC voltage on the ADAPTER_SENSE dataline."
