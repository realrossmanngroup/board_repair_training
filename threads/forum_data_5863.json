How low is resistance to GND on that bus? \nLook at Q7330 it's a dual FET. The top one is the high side, it runs from the \"full\" PPBUS power to the \"low\" voltage output. If it shorts there is a direct connection from the 12.6v PPBUS to the RAM."}

If it matches any of the coils you measured you probably have a shorted high side FET on that bus."}

So then I went around with my laser temperature gun, narrowing down with evaporating alcohol to find ISL6259HRTZ is hot as shit meaning that's it's the thing shorting to ground, but would this also cause the CPUIMVP_PHASE* stuff to do so as well, and would this chip have been able to make the clicking sounds?"}
