If you want to fix that you will need to remove the LCD, good luck with not cracking it.\nThere is a similar problem with the flat cable that carries the image data and that causes vertical distortion\/no image(only backlight) in the LCD. Same problem just in the left flat cable instead of the right one.\n\nAll 2016 13\" models are fixed for free by Apple. With the rest you are screwed for now...."
