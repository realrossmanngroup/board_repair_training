Board has ppbus (13.2v) and 20v on USB-C power input (0W/0A draw), but not much else. <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> is missing completely. Thought it might be the SMC since signal was missing completely, but replaced SMC and symptoms persist. Also replaced <CHIP>U7650</CHIP> to be safe. SMC power (<SIGNAL>3V3_G3H_SMC_VDD</SIGNAL>) is present. I have .4v at L7960, and no damage or anything around <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>. All related pull-up resistors for <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> (<RESISTOR>R5192</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R8110</RESISTOR>) measuring fine. <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET</SIGNAL> signals all high.\n\nIs this possibly a <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> power issue?
