            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board. Mother just shipped to me to look at. She had still some water near the machine and obviously got inside... She did not send to me first and took it to an computer repair shop.\n\nI can not find any liquid or signs/evidence or clues of where liquid could/would have been.\n\nThe only issue I have right now is that the power button won't turn on the machine. Also, once you plug the charger in, it turns right on. The entire keyboard works as it should, all keys work. You press the power button (and I mean barely touch/press for a millisecond) and bam, machine turns off. Only way to the get it back on is to remove the battery connection, plug battery back in and then plug the charger up and it'll turn back on...\n\nI'm looking at the schematic and it looks like PIB 5 is the power button (as it is attached to <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> and <RESISTOR>R5710</RESISTOR> / <CAPACITOR>C5710</CAPACITOR>. \nShould I be looking for a 0V at <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>, until the power button is pressed, momentarily bring the signal high?\n\nI measure at <RESISTOR>R5710</RESISTOR> and I am getting 3.415V when the machine is off. When I press the power button, it goes low and comes back up to 3.4v when I let go.\n\nBad keyboard? or something with <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>?"

It did the same thing with another new keyboard.\n\nI have a question... anyone have a better board view for the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A board? The one I have, the <CHIP>U5010</CHIP> area is missing two components... there is a cap and a resistor not on the BV...\n\nThe resistor looks like it is connected to PIN 1 of <CAPACITOR>C5020</CAPACITOR> and then what looks to be a cap connected to <CHIP>U5010</CHIP> at pins 2 and 3, in a loop... They're definitely on the board and here is a pic attached...\n\nThey looked terrible and wanted to replace them, but they went into the 5th dimension and I can't locate them on the BV or schematic (like i said, they aren't \"omit\" items, they were there and you can see them in the photo)"
