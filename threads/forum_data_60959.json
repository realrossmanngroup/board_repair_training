I'm not sure why it's working now because all I did so far was test L7030 In diode mode to ground and got 0.466v on both sides.  Before moving on to the next coil I wanted to check  <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> again noticed it was at 13.1v and it was steady. I began to check the other rails that were jumpy from my original response and noticed they were steady as well. So with all my rails steady I put the laptop back together turned the machine on and it powered right up!"
