I have an 820-00840-A that does not power on. The amp meter reads 20v but the amps loop from .00a to .50a. I'm not sure of the history of this motherboard but it does look like some rework was done around u7000.\n\nPPBUS_G3H: Starts at 13.09V and holds for about 5 seconds then jumps around really fast to  12v 11v 13v 11v 8v then to 13.09v then that cycle repeats\nPP5V_S5: 0.2V-5.1V Loops \nPP3V3_G3H: 3.4V \nPP3V3_S5: 0v-3.3V Loops \nPPDCIN_G3H: 19V \nP5VS4_EN: 0v-3.2v Loops"}

I'm not sure why it's working now because all I did so far was test L7030 In diode mode to ground and got 0.466v on both sides.  Before moving on to the next coil I wanted to check  PPBUS_G3H again noticed it was at 13.1v and it was steady. I began to check the other rails that were jumpy from my original response and noticed they were steady as well. So with all my rails steady I put the laptop back together turned the machine on and it powered right up!"}
