        "message":"EDIT 820-2936-B board, 13\", board receives power well but when power button is pressed the fan will whir and the sleep light will come on for a moment, then abruptly cut off.\n\nWhen I keep only the charger plugged in instead of the battery, eventually after many cycles of doing the above the sleep light will blink in sequence 3 times, as if it were indicating a RAM issue. I've tried different sticks tho of course.\n\nNo signs of water damage on the board, could it potentially be a bad RAM slot\/cartridge? Machine never beeps or indicates anything other than the 3 sleep light blinks, but mostly it's just the brief cut on\/cut off cycle.\nPlan to test the main power rails tomorrow, but was wondering if you guys knew what it could be\/what direction to push me in.\n\nThanks!"

Dealing with so many 2012s lately it slipped my mind.\nG3H bounces between 12.6v and 4.0v, PWRGD starts at ~3.2v, holds for a few moments and then drops to 3mv bc of the power cycle. 3V42 is stable. Maybe U7000?\n5V_S3, 5V_S0, 3V3_S3 AND 3V3_S0 are all present before the power cycle happens, same thing w\/PWRGD where it holds for a few moments then drops."

I should remember to troubleshoot that when I see problems like these.\nSo I did a bit of further troubleshooting:\n\nTried multiple batteries before, all of which didn't work.

No beeps, nothing awry, you get a chime and everything.\nJust with AC, computer does not turn on fully.
