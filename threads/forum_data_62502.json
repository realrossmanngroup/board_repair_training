This is necessary for setting SMC_LID properly so the machine knows whether it is closed or open. When this is low, the machine will think it is closed which may cause it to go to sleep or have no backlight on the screen.",

            "message": "Hi guys, I've got the computer in title with strange issue - it only turns on after SMC reset (CTRL-ALT-SHIFT + POWER). When turned on, it works perfectly fine, passes AHT and benchmarks, all 4 TBT ports work fine, it does restart correctly every time. Once it is turned off (Shutdown under the OS) it won't back on with power button pressed or lid open - SMC must be reset in order to get it start. I have replaced the power button, reprogrammed EFI, reballed SMC - no luck. Battery is 100% charged now but it happens when battery is low as well. No single sign of spillage anywhere and all sensors are white. What else may cause such problem?"

            "message": "All the suggested voltages are OK. No signs of corrosion on J6100 and <RESISTOR>R7090</RESISTOR> (correct value, all connections checked OK).\n\nFinally worked it out. Found unstable voltage (floating between 0V and 1.8V) on <RESISTOR>R5261</RESISTOR> (<SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_RIGHT</SIGNAL>) while the lid was open and there was stable 3.4V on <RESISTOR>R5251</RESISTOR> (<SIGNAL>HALL_SENSOR_LEFT</SIGNAL>). It was right Hall sensor fault. Replaced and MLB now works like a charm. My suspicion about lid sensor problem raised when I reconnected the battery and connected the PSU - I found that power consumption looks quite similar to the situation when the lid is closed on a working machine with battery fully charged (5V -> 20V with \"PSU connected\" beep -> 5V @20mA)."
