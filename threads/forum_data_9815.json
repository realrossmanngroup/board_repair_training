Measured around, replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q4690</TRANSISTOR>, nothing. <CAPACITOR>C4616</CAPACITOR> was shorted to ground. Replaced that, still no USB.\n\nNext day I plugged in the charger and got no green light! I thought it would be something easy. I also have a donor board with onewire working. Great help! I measured <RESISTOR>R6917</RESISTOR> pin1 16.82V pin2 0V, healthy board shows pin2 7.42V. <RESISTOR>R6917</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R6918</RESISTOR> measure 140K, schematic says 270K. What the heck?"

This happened because of plugging in the magsafe on a bare connector and not aligning it, so onewire shorts to 18V bus.\nYou cannot expect a resistor that is in circuit to measure the correct value. It could be lower because of other stuff in parallel with it. If it measured higher then there could be a problem."
