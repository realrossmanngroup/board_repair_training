    "definitions": {
        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "U8160": "What is U8160? a CHIP.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_OCH_PWROK": "What is PM_OCH_PWROK? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PPUBS_G3H": "What is PPUBS_G3H? a SIGNAL."

            "message": "i received this machine today for a screen replacement now it won't power on. this was a normal complete top lid replacement that had no complications everything went smooth(and yes the batter got unplugged before service), but when i went to power it on to test the screen i got no power. at first i had no green/orange light on the charger switched to different charger and got green/orange light. This is where it gets strange... the machine would only get a light on the charger if i unplugged the charger from another machine. long story short... i found i had an issue with the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> sorting <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> to only having 2.0v out.\nso change <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> get all voltages back on track. but still no power on. i tested around to find i have no <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> so i went a little further to find i didn't have <SIGNAL>PM_OCH_PWROK</SIGNAL> then no <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>.\n\nfrom what I'm seeing <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> comes from <CHIP>U8160</CHIP>? but this chip is not on the board( never was there) I'm kinda way beyond not sure where i should go from here.\n\nany ideas would be awesome"
