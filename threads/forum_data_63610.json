No fan spin now.\n\n<CHIP>U7210</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7270</CHIP> looked burnt, replaced them as well but no change.\n\nAll AWAKE and SLP2R voltages are present but cannot enter DFU mode.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL> is shorted but nothing gets warm on thermal cam.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.30V\n\nNot sure where to go from here."
