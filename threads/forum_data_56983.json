PP3V3_ SUS is 3.3V. I'm getting voltages on coils. The CPU on this board does get warm but I get no USB activity what so ever. Board is on bench with nothing else plugged in."}

I have 4 more 820-00165 boards and the Medusa can copy bios to it but the board in question got stuck at 67% and then I tried it again and it won't even start. At that point do you just take a known good BIOS from another board with the same model number and then just change serial, FSYS and ME region?"}
