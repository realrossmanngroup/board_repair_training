There is nothing wrong with the backlight from startup and it's fine as long as you don't let it sleep. As soon as it sleeps and the backlight goes off it stays off even when you wake the Mac and can see an image on the screen the backlight does not come  back on, Restart it again and all good. It's just a sleep \/ wake thing."}
