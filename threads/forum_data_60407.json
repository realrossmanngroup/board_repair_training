I tried replacing the connector cables in both with no resolve. Neither appear to have any physical damage. One of them was purchased \"new\" in July and suddenly is no longer being detected by 820-3662. The other works with the same board but has occasional lines and flicker. Looking at the display logic boards I don't see any visible signs of an issue.\n\nAny likelihood of either being an LCD board repair? or are problems most likely in the ribbon cables or display itself?"}

Looks great at first then gets occasional flicker in backlight and also scrolling horizontal lines. The reason I think it may be fixable is it doesn't appear to be related to movement of the display cables or tapping the screen or anything."}
