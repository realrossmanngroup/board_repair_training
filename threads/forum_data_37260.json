Ive got an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1534</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> in for water spill so its not turning on at all but ive looked all over the board and cant see a part number, its a early 2016 and there seams to be 3 different variations according to the serial number for this model/year , so im not sure what schematics to go and look for ?, ok a bit hasty it does come on and i can see a faint apple logo but dont have a test screen for one of these so board part number would be handy"
