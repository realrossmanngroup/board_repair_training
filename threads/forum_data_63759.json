The power button works, touchpad / keyboard pair is also confirmed to be good with another logic board.\n\nChecking touch pad connector voltages, the only problematic-looking one is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4_IPD</SIGNAL> at 2.1V. I traced this line back to <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>. Am I right in thinking this rail gets generated by <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> ? If so, the output from <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> is 2.1V as well.\n\nWhat can I check next ?\n\nThank you"
