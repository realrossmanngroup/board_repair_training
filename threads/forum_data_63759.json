        "message":"Clean looking board, the only issue is that the touchpad and keyboard not working. The power button works, touchpad \/ keyboard pair is also confirmed to be good with another logic board.\n\nChecking touch pad connector voltages, the only problematic-looking one is PP3V3_S4_IPD at 2.1V. I traced this line back to U2800. Am I right in thinking this rail gets generated by U2800 ? If so, the output from U2800 is 2.1V as well.\n\nWhat can I check next ?\n\nThank you"
