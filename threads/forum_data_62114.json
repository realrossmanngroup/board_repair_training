Being the king of small tests, I wanted to test to see if an A1708 screen could potentially work on this model. #BadIdea\n\nCurrently, the motherboard (820-01987) partially supports the 20V load. That is to say that the USBC-A takes 20V directly without going through 5V. And the USBC-B goes through 5V then 20V. The 2 charge ports are in 0.5A unstable, and are close to 10W but always drop down to approximately 1W unstable.\n\nThis Macbook doesn't turn on any more (on the other hand the trackpad which reacts randomly to the click). Have you ever encountered this type of failure on this model ?\n\nSo, while testing the voltages, I unsealed a few issues with the circuits, and I'm wondering if you could help me find where the problem is coming from ?\n\n- P5VG3S_PGOOD - 1.76v instead of 5v\nIt is important to specify that the voltage is not stable. This decreases slightly every second to drop to 0v after about 3 seconds. Then back to 1.76v, etc ...\n\n- PP3V3_S5 - 0 instead of 3v3\n- PP1V8_S5 - 0 instead of 1V8\n- PPVPCORE_S5 - 0 instead of 0.7-1V\n- PP1V_PRIM (PCH POWER) - 0 instead of 1V\n\n- PP1V8_S3 - 0 instead of 1V8\n- PP1V2_S3 - 0 instead of 1V2\n- PP1V_S3 - 0 instead of 1V\n- PP1V2_S0SW - 0 instead of 1V2\n- PP1V_S0SW - 0 instead of 1V\n- PPVCCIO (CPU GFX) - 0 instead of 0.95V\n- PPVCC_S0_CPU - 0 instead of 0.55 - 1.5V\n- PPVCCSA_S0_CPU - 0 instead of 0.55 - 1.15V\n- PPVCCGT_S0_CPU - 0 instead of 0.55 - 1.5V\n\nAll other voltage are normal.\n\nDo you have a solution?\nthank you in advance for your help"}

Because the software I use (XZZ and Refox) doesn't show me the diode values for MacBook. So I can't check if the values I have are accurate. Yet you were able to tell me if they were abnormal. I would have liked to know how you managed to find the right Diode Value ? :)\n\nAlso, you said me \" Possibly overvoltage on 5V power rail damaged more things... \". Could you tell me what you would do first to check where the problem is ? Concretely, I would like to understand the systematics (the first things to do) in this type of case.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\nMany thanks"}
