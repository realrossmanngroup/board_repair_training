I have tried recover and also revive but errors out on both. Also it shows the recovery screen as in pic when mac is plugged in without pressing any buttons but if you hold power for a few mins the hold all 4 buttons it says DFu not recovery but still the same outcome. Also the target mac screen shows logo with progress bar fully across then disappears then the error in pic shows on host machine."}
