Frapple site says no ram installed, i checked every rail 1 by 1 everything read normal no water damage viable. I replaced the u7300 chip i tried different rams different slots all same issue i even ultrasonic cleaned the board. What else could i check to try and solve this issue?"}

If you don't have voltage on L7330, then probably a dead U7300. What voltage is on L7330?"}
