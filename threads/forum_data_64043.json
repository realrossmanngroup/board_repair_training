I replaced the C7291 filter capacitor from the 5v line, also replaced the primary U7200 PWM and also did not solve. The machine even started yesterday and worked very well, I thought I had solved the problem, but this morning again presented the symptom!\n\n* One thing I noticed when turning on without video, is that your cooler went up to 100%  so it turns off on the button, I turned on again and started the symptom of falling PP5V_S3_REG Soon after I heated the SMC and she returned to connect with video and everything right, I think it has to do with the SMC and Seul pulse PM_SLP_S4_L which is responsible for enabling the PP5V_S3_REG\n\nWhat do you think?"}
