        "A1278": "What is A1278? A1278 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook or Macbook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2254, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2327, 820-2530, 820-2879, 820-2936, 820-3115..",
        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",

I replaced the <CAPACITOR>C7291</CAPACITOR> filter capacitor from the 5v line, also replaced the primary <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> PWM and also did not solve. The machine even started yesterday and worked very well, I thought I had solved the problem, but this morning again presented the symptom!\n\n* One thing I noticed when turning on without video, is that your cooler went up to 100%  so it turns off on the button, I turned on again and started the symptom of falling <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL> Soon after I heated the SMC and she returned to connect with video and everything right, I think it has to do with the SMC and Seul pulse <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> which is responsible for enabling the <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL>\n\nWhat do you think?"
