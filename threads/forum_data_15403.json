Some sticky juice. Not very much mostly some sticky stains on top of cooler and RAM. Trackpad also little sticky.\n\nIt was not charging the battery so I tried another battery and this charged fine. \n\nThen I thought I would clean those sticky stains and cleaned it in uc.\n\nNow I have got the chime but no image on either internal or external screen and fans goes slowly up to full speed.\n\nWhere do I start with this issue ?\n\nThanks"}
