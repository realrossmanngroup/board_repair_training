        "A1708": "What is A1708? A1708 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2017, 2016 with EMC 3164, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00840, 820-00875..",
        "820-00875": "What is 820-00875? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D6905": "What is D6905? Diode sitting between PPBUS_G3H/PP18V5 charger voltage and PP3V42_G3H power supply input on very old Macbooks(before 2011), can die and cause PP3V42_G3H to be missing and have no input voltage. .",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. ."
