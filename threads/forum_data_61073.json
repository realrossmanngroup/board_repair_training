        "message":"First of all, welcome to the forum!\n\nPlease post accurate information.\nHow do you get 3V3 on CD3215 chips, if USB-C meter stays black?\nDo you really get black (no indication) USB-C meter (\"does not power on\"), or is stuck in 5V?\n\nNever inject voltage into a power rail, before checking for short first.\n\nNo idea how to interpret your measurments to D6905."
