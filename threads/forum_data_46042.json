No image and No USB activity! \n\nWith <CHIP>U6201</CHIP> out, I already checked for other components heating but  I did not find any. <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> heat a bit but i think it's normal! \n\nsuggestions for this ?? \n\nThanks"

If the PCH was separated off CPU i can easily replace for a new one.. but this processors are the only ones i don't know to remove without bent! \n\nYou can close this post \n\nBest regards"
