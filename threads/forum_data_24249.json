DCIN_G3H is at 16.5v, so that would probably be the culprit in my mind? TechTools & Coconut both detect and test out the battery as being fine, charging at a decent rate. Had a problem where it just would not turn on for a bit, then started turning on without issues.\n\nI can order a new DC-IN board but could U7100 be pulling down DCIN_G3H to 16.5 and also keeping it from powering on?"}

Fun update, disconnected battery to plug old one back in and it stopped powering on altogether. Same symptom for when the customer brought it in.\n\nHave PP5v_S5, PP3v3_s5, but no PP5v_s4rs3.\n\nNo enable signal, hence no PM_SLP_S4_L\n\nNo signs of liquid damage, no signs of corrosion either. Any common issues with these boards?"}
