TechTools & Coconut both detect and test out the battery as being fine, charging at a decent rate. Had a problem where it just would not turn on for a bit, then started turning on without issues.\n\nI can order a new DC-IN board but could <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> be pulling down <SIGNAL>DCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> to 16.5 and also keeping it from powering on?"
