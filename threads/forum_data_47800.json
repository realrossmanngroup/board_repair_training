However I have a similar problem but with slightly different circumstances..\nAbove mentioned logic board. Corrosion on <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>/ <CAPACITOR>C5120</CAPACITOR>/<RESISTOR>R5127</RESISTOR>/<CAPACITOR>C5101</CAPACITOR>/ <CAPACITOR>C5126</CAPACITOR> and the area around <CAPACITOR>C7799</CAPACITOR>/<CAPACITOR>C7712</CAPACITOR>/<CAPACITOR>C7713</CAPACITOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR>. Also Pins 3/4/5 on J8300 corroded away. For the interim not worried about the 2nd area but I have changed <CHIP>U5110</CHIP>/ <CAPACITOR>C5120</CAPACITOR>? <RESISTOR>R5127</RESISTOR>/ <CAPACITOR>C5101</CAPACITOR>/<CAPACITOR>C5126</CAPACITOR>.\nInitally I had no voltage on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> was 3.42v. After changing the 5 components even though I got <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> back @ 8.4v I still have no green led or fan spin.\nAfter reading Don's post I removed <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> and I get the same result of green LED for about 3-4 secs then to orange, fan spin for about 2 sec before it slows to a stop. I dont get the 1/4 spin. it full spins for the 2 sec's.\nI have checked <CAPACITOR>C5125</CAPACITOR> where i have a voltage of 0.058v capacitance of 9uF and 3.369v at both pins on <RESISTOR>R7100</RESISTOR>. It does read 0 ohms\n\nI have removed <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> as did Don and I get the following reading:-\nPin 1 - 3.42v\npin 2 - 0.0v\npin 3 - 0.0v\npin 4 - 0.027v\npin 5 - 3.389v\npin 6 - 0.0v\npin 7 - 3.418v\npin 8 - 0.052v\n\nAny Guidance is gratefully received as usual.\nThanks in advance."
