I'm having this similar issue with multiple boards and I always end up chasing my tail - so wanted to start fresh before I started replacing stuff.\n\nWhen the board is connected to AC only, PPBUS_G3H measures 12.4v but then starts decreasing by about 1 volt per second.  No issue once battery is connected.  On other boards, I've replaced u7000, u6990, multiple resistors and caps around these ICs but no luck.  Should I be thinking about some other type of component failure such as a coil?\n\nthanks,\nPaul"}

The cycle then restarts.\nAlso, SMC_BC_ACOK flips between 3.3v and 3v constantly.  I checked SMC pullup resistor and it is good."}
