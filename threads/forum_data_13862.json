On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  ."

            "message": "Greetings.  I'm having this similar issue with multiple boards and I always end up chasing my tail - so wanted to start fresh before I started replacing stuff.\n\nWhen the board is connected to AC only, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> measures 12.4v but then starts decreasing by about 1 volt per second.  No issue once battery is connected.  On other boards, I've replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <CHIP>U6990</CHIP>, multiple resistors and caps around these ICs but no luck.  Should I be thinking about some other type of component failure such as a coil?\n\nthanks,\nPaul"
