PPBUS is 13v.\nP3V3_S5 = 3.3v.\nPP5V_S5 = 5v.\nNo S4 voltages.\nNo PM_SLP_S5_L and lower is not present.\nSo I checked S5_PWRD which is 0.07v.\n\nThan I started checking on U7650:\n- P5VP3V3_VREG3 = 3.3v\n- PP5V_S5 = 5v\n- P5VP3V3_VREF2 = 2v\n- P3V3S5_EN = 3.4v\n- P5VS5_EN = 3.4v\n- S5_PWRGD = 0.074v\n- P3V3S5_VFB2 = 1.003v\n\nDiode mode S5_PWRGD = 0.490\n\nReplaced U7650 twice with exact same results...\nThat I don't have any PM_SLP_ and no s4 rails must be because S5_PWRGD needs to be present right? S5_PWRGD should be high when S4 rails aren't enabled yet?\nThere was no liquid damage around U7650. When it's outputting all voltages correct why isn't it saying that the S5 power is good?"}

Has 3.3v on one side and is around 95kohm. So pullup should be working.\nAnyway S5_PWRGD is now definitely the problem to solve.\n\nThere is corrosion around U7800. Will reflow it tomorrow maybe it is pulling it down."}

I removed U7800 and applied USB-C power. Some smoke came from somewhere.\nThan I noticed PPBUS_G3H got shorted. U7800 was still removed.\nI've injected 5v on PPBUS_G3H with 0.5a. Only thing that heats up is the PCH\/CPU. Is the PCH now dead?\n\nI just read I shouldn't inject voltage on PPBUS before checking mosfets. What should I measure?"}
