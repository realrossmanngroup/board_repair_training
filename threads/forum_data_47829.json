        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",
        "CHGR_AMON": "What is CHGR_AMON? CHGR_AMON provides DC current sense information to the SMC(System management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip). It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",

            "message": "Hello all!  First post!\n\nI have a customer who has brought in a water damaged Macbook and this one has me lost....  Customer came in stating the system booted fine with the charger plugged in and when she unplugged it, it would instantly turn off.  After going over the board thoroughly, there were 2 spots with very light corrosion.  One was around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and one area was around DZ6607.  After carefully cleaning away the corrosion I did not see any pads or traces damaged so we tested the board again it did not recognize the original battery again.  We then tried a new battery and it started working....  Battery percentage showed up and everything appeared to work.  After fully assembling the laptop thinking we had figured it out, the battery stopped recognizing again.  Next step was replace <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> with a new one which we have done... still no change.  If the Macbook is prompted to boot without the charger, nothing happens.  Plug in the charger and press the power button, we get Apple logo.  Unplugging the adapter will cause the machine to boot right up to about where the cursor would appear on the screen and it goes shuts off.\n\nAny ideas?  Where does everyone get diode mode readings like ZXW for iPhones?  I am using OpenBoardView."
