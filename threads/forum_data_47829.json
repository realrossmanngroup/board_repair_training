First post!\n\nI have a customer who has brought in a water damaged Macbook and this one has me lost....  Customer came in stating the system booted fine with the charger plugged in and when she unplugged it, it would instantly turn off.  After going over the board thoroughly, there were 2 spots with very light corrosion.  One was around U7100 and one area was around DZ6607.  After carefully cleaning away the corrosion I did not see any pads or traces damaged so we tested the board again it did not recognize the original battery again.  We then tried a new battery and it started working....  Battery percentage showed up and everything appeared to work.  After fully assembling the laptop thinking we had figured it out, the battery stopped recognizing again.  Next step was replace U7100 with a new one which we have done... still no change.  If the Macbook is prompted to boot without the charger, nothing happens.  Plug in the charger and press the power button, we get Apple logo.  Unplugging the adapter will cause the machine to boot right up to about where the cursor would appear on the screen and it goes shuts off.\n\nAny ideas?  Where does everyone get diode mode readings like ZXW for iPhones?  I am using OpenBoardView."}
