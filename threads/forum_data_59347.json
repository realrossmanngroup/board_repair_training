I applied 3.42v to the system side and reduced the amps to see what was the lowest I would get, this was 0.04amps and made me think that at such a low amp it can't be a problem on the system. I then start to measure from R607 and noticed that when I got to <DIODE>D6902</DIODE> on one side I was getting 5.12v but on the other it was 3.36v and bingo problem found."
