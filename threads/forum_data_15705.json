        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PP3V42_3GH": "What is PP3V42_3GH? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMBUS_CHGR_SDA": "What is SMBUS_CHGR_SDA? SMBUS_CHGR_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "SMBUS_CHGR_SCL": "What is SMBUS_CHGR_SCL? SMBUS_CHGR_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",

            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nThis one looked like it took a dive in an orange juice bucket. I UC it and then there was no green light. I looked around and <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> was missing while <SIGNAL>PP3V42_3GH</SIGNAL> was ok. The problem was <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> which I replaced and voila there is green light and the CPU gets hot.\n\nI now half assemble the laptop to check if there is image and here is what happens. When I plug the magsafe in there are all voltages present on the motherboard at all coils and the screen shows an empty battery with a bolt (like in iPhones) for few secs - no fan spine - and it then turns off (along with all voltages except S5 voltages and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> at 12.5 to 12.6V). That happens every time I reconnect the magsafe.\n\nHas this macbook turned into an iPhone? Should I hook a sim card? Other ideas?\n\nbr,\ngeorge"
