        "message":"I have 2 non-liquid damage 820-4924 boards with the same exact issue it seems.\n\nWhen the battery is plugged it, they freeze whenever there's enough load on the CPU.\nSometimes loading OS causes that, sometimes it doesn't. However, if I manage to boot,\nanything that causes the clockspeed to go up will freeze the computer. All power-rails incl. CPU Vcore stays on.\n\nWithout battery the CPU is limited to some 0,8GHz. That way there is no issues whatsoever apart from the CPU being clocked down.\n\nI couldn't find similar problems on the forum.\n\nAny ideas?"
