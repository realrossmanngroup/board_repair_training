I replaced the trackpad as well as the cable twice and the trackpad is registering a click just fine but the cursor doesnt move. I have tried external bootables and verified the new parts work in other machines. I have no known-good boards or even doner boards of this model to compare to but here are the diode mode measurements for each pin on the connector and I was hoping someone could provide me with the correct readings to compare to or if there should be something else i should be looking at first. \n\nStarting from Top left -> Top Right and then Bottom left -> bottom right\n\nTOP\n\nPin 1 - .332\nPin 2 - .705\nPin 3 - .693\nPin 4 - .694\nPin 5 - .957\nPin 6 - .694\nPin 7 - .694\nPin 8 - .693\nPin 9 - .693\nPin 10 - .694\nPin 11 - 0.00\n\nBOTTOM\n\nPin 1 - .699\nPin 2 - .466\nPin 3 - .435\nPin 4 - .694\nPin 5 - .693\nPin 6 - .692\nPin 7 - .666\nPin 8 - .693\nPin 9 - .693\nPin 10 - .694\nPin 11 - 0.00"}

I can't remember offhand if this model uses that, but I'm pretty sure it does. I'm not near a schematic but it should be easy to find."}
