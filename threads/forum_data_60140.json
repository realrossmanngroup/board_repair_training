When i got it was overheating U8295 which i replaced just to see but the same issue again. I measured all contact and it came to be a full short on pin 5 and 6 on U8295. Followed the line couldn't find the short but i injected voltage and the short was removed and now diode mode reading in the line is 0.112 tested with 2 different meters. With injected voltage now doesn't show any short but with external power supply shows 0.081amps pull. Any suggestions please?\n\nThanks :cool:"}
