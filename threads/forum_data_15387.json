When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

After that it did catch green light, it even started okay with lcd. Then I connected the battery (which had corrosion before on the logic board part ). After that the green light went away and never came back. Probably battery is fried too....\nTried other DC board too...\n\nNow:\nPP3V42 is missing\nPPBUS is missing\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3HOT</SIGNAL> is missing\nACOK is missing\n\nResistors around ISL are fine (<RESISTOR>R7105</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>/22, <RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR>/52), though ISL got some coffey on it.\n\nClues?"
