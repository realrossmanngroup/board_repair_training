Sometimes the Apple has slight red lines on that moment. Then it restarts and do it again in a loop. I believe it's the moment when it should switch on internal graphics.\n\nIt's a motherboard issue, I've got many other screens, SSDs and all the other parts for this laptop, I even tried to put the motherboard in different body from another <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> 2012, but it's still the same. USB drive with ASD or macOS will not boot either. Internet recovery also not possible. No changes after SMC/PRAM reset or in SMC bypass mode.\n\nI found more threads about similar issues, but never found a solution. The board was a bit dusty, but no spills or oxidation and no signs of previous work - owner told me that one day it just did not boot. Whole machine looks good, no dings, adapter is genuine MS2 85W.\n\nI already changed all four VRAMs, GPU, GMUX <CHIP>U9100</CHIP>, <CHIP>U9150</CHIP>, <CHIP>U9200</CHIP>, <CHIP>U9210</CHIP>, <CHIP>U8900</CHIP>, I tried BIOS chip from different <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, even tried flash with clean ME, but it's still all the same.\n\nIs it possible that something went wrong with Intel graphics and changing the CPU will solve this? I already spent a lot of time and money on this board, but it's so tempting to not give up when it \"almost\" works...\n\nEdit: I forgot to add some measurements:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.56V\n<SIGNAL>P3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.41V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.33V\n\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> 3.33V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> 1.05V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL> 1.52V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0</SIGNAL> 1.81V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> 3.34V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> 3.34V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 3.34V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> 5.02V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> 5.03V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> 5.03V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> 5.03V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_GPU</SIGNAL> 0.89V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> 0.80V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL> 0.84V only during chime, otherwise 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3RS0_CPUDDR</SIGNAL> 1.34V\nPP1V5R1V35_S0GPU 1.5V before chime, 1.35V after chime\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0GPU</SIGNAL> 3.32V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V0_S0GPU_ISNS</SIGNAL> 1.05V"

In W10 there's only one GPU in device manager and that's <SIGNAL>DEV_0FD5</SIGNAL> which is GT650 I believe (driver is missing, so it's using some Microsoft generic one). So those artifacts are not made by Intel graphics? But those artifacts are exactly the same as on the Apple logo before every crash and they are present since I first opened this machine... and I really changed GPU + VRAMs for a new ones and artifacts did not change at all after that. They are on external screen also, even with internal disconnected."
