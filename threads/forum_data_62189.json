            "message": "A1418, I was installing Monterey on a ssd connected USB.  Machine randomly switched off during the process, immediately switched back on and started the install again, after a while it randomly switched off again.\n\nI removed the screen and found that when I plugged in the power the fan immediately started to spin and LED 1&2 were lit.  Did some digging and found a suggestion here to try removing the RAM to check for bleeps.  I've done that but now the second LED blinks and the fan doesn't spin up - even after installing the ram and reassembling. \n\n\nI have had a quick look for a schematic but not found one.  In this scenario I'm thinking to try a new PSU first but they are horrendously priced so before I spend loads of money does any one have any suggestions or possibly a schematic?"
