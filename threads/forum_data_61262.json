            "message": "Got this iMac 27 that owner had attempted some work on and now won't power on. What i noticed was after it's power on the first time and then shutdown, it won't power on until the power plug is removed for a few seconds. Looking at the board LED's, when i first power it up, all the LED's on (except when display is removed, three LED comes on). Once i shut it down, all but the first led's goes off, except the first LED is very dim. At the point i'm unable to power it back up until i unplug the power cord and reconnect, then the firs LED brightens up again and i can power it.\n\nFound a couple broken components, the ethernet port pulse transformer (on a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00597</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>, this is either T4020 or 4025). Since this is for the ethernet port, and since couldn't find a replacement, i went ahead and cleaned up the traces and lift it black along with removing the inductor connected to it. \nAnother broken component, which i replaced was one of the usb esd protection diode. \n\nAny suggestions"
