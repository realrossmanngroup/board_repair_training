With the keyboard unplugged, I can short the pads and it works great minus the keyboard. If I short the pads and then quickly plug in the keyboard everything works great, including the keyboard. If I then click sleep at the login screen with the keyboard plugged in, it hard shuts down (hard drive does the click sound) but it does a normal sleep when it is not plugged in. If I hold down the power button at the login screen it will do a hard shutdown so it seems that the power button is indeed working (sorta).  But if I then push it to turn it back on I get nothing.  Am I right in assuming it is the keyboard itself that is bad? I got it from another store who just did a keyboard swap and are looking for a second opinion.  Thanks in advance."
