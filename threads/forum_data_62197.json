Missing PP3V3_G3H_RTC and the area around U6903 and the chip itself are gross. Only problem is, I don't have a donor and Mouser + DigiKey are both out of stock. Suppose I could order from Aliexpress but the closer the better. Any other ideas where to pick some of these up, or any other compatible chips that would work in it's spot?"}

Got the chips in and replaced U6903, rebuilt the area around it from a donor as most of the components were nasty. USB meter now shows 5V 0.05-0.06A. Nothing on the chip has a diode reading under 400 so nothing seems shorted, but  PP3V3_G3H_RTC goes up to 3v and then drops down and cycles over and over. PPBUS does the same. What other rails could be shorted in this case? Other than this one spot the board is clear of liquid damage.\n\nDiode:\nPPBUS_G3H: 442\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC: 405\nPP3V3_G3H: 544"}
