Could be battery indicator light too, so disconnect that first. Also check PPBUS voltage, it will probably be 12.3 instead of 12.6V"}

Either you're measuring the wrong pin, or the ISL exploded and sent 16v to the SMC. When it does this it is usually dead and the machine is not turning on. Either way, what is PPBUS_G3H voltage to answer duke's question?"}
