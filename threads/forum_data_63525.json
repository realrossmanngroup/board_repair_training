I  measured <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> in diode mode and I got a value of 0.388 and in   voltage mode I am getting 12.25 V but my amp meter is still reading 5V I have not changed The USB Controller chips <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> OR <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>\nPlease advice that would be highly appreciated.\n\nThank you very much"
