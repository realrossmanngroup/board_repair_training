        "D7012": "What is D7012? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year model macbook airs, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line.."

            "message": "I cut the wires off of chargers and use them in my bench top supply similar to what Louis Rossmann does. I even use the same old HP power power-supplies he does. I ran into a board that gave me a spanking and wanted to see what people's thoughts on this would be.\n\nI serviced this laptop and fixed water damage which was minor. After repairing the water damage I tested it with my bench top power supply. I clicked the mag safe, got the green light and fin spin. The board passed diagnostics. I was happy. wrapped it up and moved on.\n\nThe machine came back the next day and the fault was \"no green light on the charger\" I tested it once again and it worked perfect. Green light every time. I performed cold tests, hot tests and flexing and every time it worked. So... i sent it back as good.\n\nIt came back again!!!! I checked it again and it was good so I took it back to the depot and checked it there with their charger and No green light! WTF.. so I took it back to the bench and tested it with a plain charger not my power supply. Guess what.. No green light!\n\n[B]How can it give me a green light with my bench supply and refuse to green light a standard charger?[/B]\n\nI understand that my charger sends the 18.5V regardless of the green light but if the SMC talks properly to my cord the light turns green.\n\nHas anyone seen this? I don't even know where to start.  I already changed the SMC!"

            "message": "<TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> WOW........\n\nI use the 85w charger cable. I cut it off a 85w head. I don't think I can give up the bench power supply. It gives me such quick and accurate information. Often I can diagnose the problem by just looking at the supply before I open up the machine. I have however started double checking boards with the regular power adapter as part of my QA. This was the first time I had seen this fault. Totally caught me off guard."

            "message": "I can't give it up. I could connect the laptop before hitting \"enter\" on the power supply to be careful. I have to watch it's power consumption and feel it. I guess I could get a AC amp meter for the AC adapter and watch that instead? I have to see what the machine is consuming. There is no way around that. That information is so valuable. Watching power consumption while watching thermal explains so much to how the machine boots and in what order. There is no way I can give up the bench power. I would feel blind.\n\nEven if I have to get out my stencil and replace a SMC now and then it's worth it. I have been on bench power for 6 months now and have not blown a SMC. I have sparked the plug so many times. Got it on side ways, The plug looks scary. But it still works.. When it dies I will just harvest another one."
