        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

            "message": "Hi \n\nthis board has been working fine in a chassis after a keyboard swap a month ago.  a daily driver for a client. \n\nBrought to me again as the external display/thunderbolt port stopped working.  This is not yet fixed although I did find <CHIP>U3210</CHIP> literally half of its pads and a couple of passives also pushed off their pads.  I've reseated this, thunderbolt still not detected.  I will replace the chip before diagnosing that further (although there was green sticky corrosion all around  the shield over <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> as well).  \n\nThe problem is since putting the board back in the chassis the keyboard and trackpad have stopped functioning.  Working fine when I was testing the machine yesterday.  Turn it on this morning and there was nothing.  I've tried three known good trackpads and three different cables (one known good and one new).  All exhibit the same behaviour. \n\nThere was gunk under the keyboard connector which I have cleaned out (the latest batch of amtech flux does not seem to get cleaned away by my ultrasonic, or even by brushing with alcohol); and I've verified that the connector pins are firmly seated on the board. \n\nis there something obvious to check on this?  I've got an hour later that I've slated to have a look at it.  \n\nthanks in advance.\nJustin"

I thought at first that i may have caused the short whilst testing the kb connector, but PPBUS is nowhere near there.  \n\nAll a bit confusing as this board's been working fine for a year (other than a keyboard problem which led to a direct replacement, then a mic problem and keyboard connector problem probably associated with the KB swap-out.  \n\nBut, some good news --- thunderbolt was working after I reseated  <CHIP>U3210</CHIP> again!  \n\ntia\njustin"
