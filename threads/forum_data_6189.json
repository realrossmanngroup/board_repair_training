Board worked then stopped working.\nChecked current sense circuit going to pin 27 & 28 again after it stopped working and resistors bad again. <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> was bad so replaced that and also replaced inrush current limmiter FET. Teted values around limmiter FET and all looks good. Turned it one, one fan spin, dead <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP>, bad resistors again.... What should I look for here?"

(Are pins 27 / 28 some sort of FET input differential amplifier or comparitor or something?)\nReplaced inrush limiter, replaced the 10ohm resistors and checked no shorts and replaced caps and checked no shorts. PPBUS now working. No fan spin yet but will probe tomorrow."
