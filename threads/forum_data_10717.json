        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR": "What is PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR? PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR is PPBUS_G3H after it has passed through a backlight fuse and a transistor that allows power through when BKLT_PLT_RST_L and LCD_BKLT_EN are present. .",
        "PP3V_SO": "What is PP3V_SO? a SIGNAL.",
        "R9789": "What is R9789? a RESISTOR.",
        "R9788": "What is R9788? a RESISTOR.",
        "R2055": "What is R2055? a RESISTOR.",
        "R9782": "What is R9782? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "Q9707": "What is Q9707? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",

        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",

The only logical way for <RESISTOR>R9704</RESISTOR> to smoke is if it is shorted to ground. The only way for it to short to ground is via <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> or <CAPACITOR>C9704</CAPACITOR>. I would measure resistance to ground on both sides of <RESISTOR>R9704</RESISTOR>[I](NO POWER APPLIED DURING RESISTANCE MEASUREMENTS!). [/I]This is most likely you fucked up soldering something, or <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> is bad. You didn't mention replacing <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> after the smoking."
