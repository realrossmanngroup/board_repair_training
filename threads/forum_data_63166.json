    "definitions": {
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "PM_EN_5VS4": "What is PM_EN_5VS4? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PM_PWRBTN": "What is PM_PWRBTN? PM_PWRBTN refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop..",
        "SMC_ONFF_L": "What is SMC_ONFF_L? This is a typo of SMC_ONOFF_L When you see SMC_ONFF_L, assume they meant to type SMC_ONOFF_L.",
        "U2800": "What is U2800? a CHIP.",
        "PM_BATLOW": "What is PM_BATLOW? PM_BATLOW is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on.",
        "PP3V3_TBT_X_S0": "What is PP3V3_TBT_X_S0? a SIGNAL.",
        "U2890": "What is U2890? a CHIP."
