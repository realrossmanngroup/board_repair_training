        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

No other history, other than the screen does have the flexgate issue because I hooked an 840 board to the screen and I can see the the apple logo but no backlight and both backlight cables look like they are broken inside.\n\nI did find a shorted cap on the <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> line, replaced cap and now have 3.3v\n\nI have all my rails from page 100 and 101 and checked all coils, and also load switches on page 78.\n\nI was really hoping that cap was it, but no :(\n\nSo I just need some further checks that I might be missing before I condemn the CPU.\n\nThanks for the help."

            "message": "Thanks for the fast reply.\n\nPlease reference which cpu rail to check. \n\nYes, I get a blinking led on all 4 ports with thumb drive.\n\nI cannot see any previous work on the board. It is really clean looking.\n\nAs a side note, I was trying to find on youtube last night any rossmann videos about this board that I might have missed. However I ran across this video that says there are 3 ways to check for a dead GPU on this board. I don't have an oscilloscope, but according to this guy in the video, my usb meter stops at .68v after \"booting\" and stays there and never changes. Is there any truth to what he is saying about diagnosing a bad GPU on this board? Just curious. \n\n[MEDIA=youtube]<SIGNAL>LWGVTPN_1S8</SIGNAL>[/MEDIA]\n\nThanks"
