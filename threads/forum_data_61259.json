No other history, other than the screen does have the flexgate issue because I hooked an 840 board to the screen and I can see the the apple logo but no backlight and both backlight cables look like they are broken inside.\n\nI did find a shorted cap on the PP3V3_S4 line, replaced cap and now have 3.3v\n\nI have all my rails from page 100 and 101 and checked all coils, and also load switches on page 78.\n\nI was really hoping that cap was it, but no :(\n\nSo I just need some further checks that I might be missing before I condemn the CPU.\n\nThanks for the help."}

It is really clean looking.\n\nAs a side note, I was trying to find on youtube last night any rossmann videos about this board that I might have missed. However I ran across this video that says there are 3 ways to check for a dead GPU on this board. I don't have an oscilloscope, but according to this guy in the video, my usb meter stops at .68v after \"booting\" and stays there and never changes. Is there any truth to what he is saying about diagnosing a bad GPU on this board? Just curious. \n\n[MEDIA=youtube]lWgvTpN_1S8[\/MEDIA]\n\nThanks"}
