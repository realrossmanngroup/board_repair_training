SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this line’s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",

(previously board can't power on when battery inserted) .\n\nok , so\n<SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL</SIGNAL>=3.3v stable\n<SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA</SIGNAL>   jumping around 0.2-3v \n\nso i thought <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA</SIGNAL> line must be the cause, replaced ISL 6259. no luck . then replaced the SMC , no luck . exact same thing. (machine can still power on)\n\nI checked around the isl 6259 area, but didn't find broken trace. pin 10 of isl 6259 goes to the pad under smc as checked.\n\nreally out of direction at this moment, this board is giving me hard time and want to get out of hands ASAP, any suggestion will be greatly appreciated."
