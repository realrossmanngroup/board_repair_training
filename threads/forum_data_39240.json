Not really a common solution to this. Sounds like replacing the CPU VCore power supply with new chips has had decent results, so there's a chance!"}

I have ~5 out there now (1 00138, 1 00163, 3 3662), no returns yet, fingers crossed. Have also seen a few boards recently where someone tried to replace the chips themselves, but did a piss poor job and killed the CPU. Bummer.\n\nedit: By the way, it's not reliable, but I've ordered 180 FDMF6808 from aliexpress, and all but 20 were new\/unsanded\/etc. The used garbage came from the same seller that the new ones came from, so it is hit or miss, but they're out there. Any benefit to trying to track down actual new 6808s vs the \"safe bet\" 6708s? What's the main difference between the chips? Just curious."}
