I have tested a new display on the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2159</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> mbp and suddenly I lost the screen and plug off the connector. since it can not boot more than to 0.330amp and drops back to 0.160 amp. And stats here. trackpad clicks and the fan turns. there is black screen. I have tried to install new DFU but it can not get it into DFU. it takes 18.96 (lower than normal - no battery) volts and 0.160 amp. the board is completely clean and had no damage before display change. is there anyone who can give a hint/help a newbeeee like me :-).\nWith battery it pulls over 2.2 amps and 20.3 volt. \ni will be greatfull and are there any special lines I need to watch out for?\nCheers and goodnight from Denmark:-)"
