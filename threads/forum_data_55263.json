            "message": "Hello. So I have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that suffered medium to major liquid damage. It was drawing 9mA, PP3V42 was 0 volts, PPBUS was 0 volts. I had the replace several components in the 3V42 area and I still have to replace most of if not all of the components in the area next to the LCD connector as well as the LCD connector. The SMC area looks ok, no signs of liquid but some resistors have that dull look to them. Well since I was not getting anything from PP3V42 and no light I decide to replace all of the components in that area. I now get 2.7V on PP3V42 but no green light. PPBUS is now 8.18v so I checked <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and it is at the 2.7V mentioned. So I assume my SMC is not turning on. Any ideas why PP3V42 is 2.7v vs the 3.42? Also, would you fix the other areas before getting PP3V42 properly working? I'll look at it more tomorrow I just thought I would ask on here first. This is just a project board for me to practice on so it is not super critical if I get it to work I just thought it would be neat to get it running because of the bad condition it was in."
