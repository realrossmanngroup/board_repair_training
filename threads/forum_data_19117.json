    "definitions": {
        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "ISL6258": "What is ISL6258? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2008 through 2009.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this lineâ€™s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "SMBUS_BATT_SCL": "What is SMBUS_BATT_SCL? SMBUS_BATT_SCL is the clock line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED..",
        "R5280": "What is R5280? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",
        "R5281": "What is R5281? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",

Tested with a known good battery.\n\nChecked resistance on <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5281</RESISTOR>. No corrosion around the SMC that I can tell. <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is present.\n\n<SIGNAL>SMBUS_BATT_SCL</SIGNAL> (<SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL</SIGNAL>) was shorted to ground, the SDA line was OK. \n\nI replaced the <CHIP>ISL6258</CHIP> <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and the short is gone, and diode mode measurements put it in line with another board that I had.\n\nAny thoughts? Bad SMC?\n\nThanks,\n\nStefan"
