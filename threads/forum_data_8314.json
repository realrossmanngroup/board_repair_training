This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

            "message": "Posting all of my \"tough\" boards here recently, and I'm fairly certain most of them have bad CPUs, but want to confirm before placing them into the parts pile. :)\n\nWorking on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3435</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that received power, gives a good light, and the fan \"twitches\", so I thought I had a quarter fan spin issue, but all current sensing looks and measures fine. Charger light does not blink or pulse between spins. Checked current sensing, all seems in order. Checked 6259, checks out fine. This board had visible signs of someone goofing with the SPI ROM chip, so I loaded my known-good dump to be sure, but no change. I have 3.3v on all pins for the SPI ROM (except pin 4 of course). I have all my S5 rails and <SIGNAL>VRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>. No shorts detected on any of the S5 or mains rails.\n\nFollowing the block diagram from the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3208</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> (and converting/tracing components and signals where necessary), I do get 1.05v on pin 1 of <CHIP>U7840</CHIP>, but I get no <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>, however <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> DOES spike when the fan twitches, but then immediately goes back to 0v. It spikes for a split second--too fast for my multimeter to even measure--and then back to 0v. Everything stops at <RESISTOR>R8115</RESISTOR>. No heat from CPU or SMC (or anywhere else on the board). Diode on pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R8115</RESISTOR> is .415.\n\nBad CPU?"
