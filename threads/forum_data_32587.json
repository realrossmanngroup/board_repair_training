Green light is present but seems to blink a little. No liquid damage after checking with Microscope.\n\nVoltages measure as follows:\nPPDCIN_G3H:  Moving between 16.2 and 16.8v\nPPBUS_G3H: 12.54 - 12.57\nPP3V42_G3H: On U6901 Swinging from 3 - 3.42v on pin 4 stable on pin 5\nPP5V_S5: 4.97\nPP3V3_S5: 3.29\nPP3V3_S4: 0v\nPP5V_S0:  0v\nSMC_Reset_L: 3.45v\nU7000: pin 17\/18 and pin 27\/28 , 3.5ohm and 20 ohm, \n\nResistors R7005\/7011\/7010\/7051\/7052\/7021\/7022 all OK (accept R7010 measures 0 but also on a working board i guess its an error in the schematics which mentions 30.1k).\n\nSuggestions?"}

Since you mention PPBUS_G3H and PPDCIN_G3H jumping back and forth I imagine the charger is being shut off due to a short circuit up ahead. What is the resistance to ground on PP3V3_S0\/PP5V_S3\/the rest? My guess is short circuit to ground on PP5V_S3."}
