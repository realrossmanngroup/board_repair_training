When i checked voltage see <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 11.8 volt but must be 12.8V. Louis wrote few times 1or 2 volts is missing on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> its cause from SMC but i want to ask again any where can i check before SMC? ( I checked <RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR>,<RESISTOR>R7052</RESISTOR>  and <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> its fine)"
