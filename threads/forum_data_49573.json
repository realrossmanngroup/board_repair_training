            "message": "This board had water damage on bottom side, but no corrosion. Doesn?t start (no fan spin) even if I am in S0 state.\nIn SMC bypass fan does spin but no chime.\nI get green/orange light, ppbus is 12,56v.\nISL was a little bit greenish, but seems to work good, with battery and charger.\n\nI checked the traces and resistors for pins 17-18 and 27-28, continuity until the chip is good and resistance is 3ohms and 21ohms.\n\nPPDCIN sensor was hit by water checked the resistors and they are good, don?t know if the sensor itself can prevent the board from starting.\n\nLooks like an smc or sensor issue.\nHow to troubleshoot sensors without running ASD? One by one?\n\nI did a slight reflow on smc just in the case if water got there but no change.\n\nultrasonic the board also with no change.\n\n\nthanks!"
