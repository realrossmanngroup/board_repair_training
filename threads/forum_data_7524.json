        "R0910": "What is R0910? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_DIV": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_DIV? LCDBKLT_EN_DIV must be low in order for the P channel MOSFET to have a lower voltage on the gate than is present on the source to allow backlight voltage to flow through the backlight circuit. .",
