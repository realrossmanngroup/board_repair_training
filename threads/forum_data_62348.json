Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

After disconnecting the battery macbook booted, display is obviously dead (flexgate) but external worked.\n\nWhen reconnecting the battery, USB charger begins to loop again. Found a burnt USB-C port and CB501 was off from one pad. Resoldered but no change for loop.\n<SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CONN</SIGNAL> is 12,66V\n\nIs this just a dead battery?"
