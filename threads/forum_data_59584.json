        "message":"Hello!,\nGot liquid damaged 820-00239 board, that takes only 5v and 0.12A, looks like someone already tried to work on this board, because found out that cap C6905 had hole on pin1 - PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H. Would you think connecting C6905 pin 1 to C6906 pin 1 would be ok in order to keep working on this board or hole already causing too many problems on this dataline?, \nChecked D6902  pin 3 on resistance mode - only 043.2 \u03a9 \nU6903 pin 10 (PM_EN_P3V3_G3H) - 0.7V only.\nU700 had flux under it so looks like someone tried to replace it already."
