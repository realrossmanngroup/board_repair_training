Would you think connecting <CAPACITOR>C6905</CAPACITOR> pin 1 to <CAPACITOR>C6906</CAPACITOR> pin 1 would be ok in order to keep working on this board or hole already causing too many problems on this dataline?, \nChecked <DIODE>D6902</DIODE>  pin 3 on resistance mode - only 043.2 Î© \n<CHIP>U6903</CHIP> pin 10 (<SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>) - 0.7V only.\nU700 had flux under it so looks like someone tried to replace it already."
