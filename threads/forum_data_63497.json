It's not recognized in DFU mode.\nWith the board alone on the desk I have 20V and about 0.50A to for about 20 seconds, then to 0.24A for a while, then to 0 and start again.\nThe board is clean, no visible damage.By checking the start sequence the only different value I found is PPVDDCPU_AWAKE 0.5V, diode mode 0.018 Ohm and there is a short.\nWhat is the best way to find the culprit?\nThanks for your help"}
