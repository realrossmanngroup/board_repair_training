        "message":"Hi.\n\ni have a macbook pro here that had liquid damage on the EDC180 area. checked ic and was shorted. replaced it with one from mouser and now i have 3.3v again ( with R3964 AND R3965 REMOVED) with these resistors in place the voltage is low. pulsing around 200-300ma when connected to a meter via USB-C.\n\nchecking from those resistors to ground im getting 1.3 ohms. also when checking PPBUS-G3H im only getting around 7v. pretty sure i have a short somewhere but unable to locate it even with a thermal camera.\n\nthe 1.3 ohms is in regards to PP3V3_G3H_RTC. Is this a correct resistance reading for this line? \n\nPlease save me from pulling anymore hair out.\n\nthanks"

Removed it and tested both incoming and outgoing on the board and short is now gone. However i do not have a spare U8250 anywhere. The part number according to schematic is SLGAP1569V\/SLG5AP1569 depending on what part you read, searching this brings up nothing on google apart from aliexpress etc. however i can find a  slg59m1558v which looks to be the exact same part.\nare you able to clarify this?\n\nthanks"

However it is faint given that is under a shield.  Im a bit puzzled as when checking the RTC 3.3v line on the board view nothing goes directly to that area. \n\nthanks"
