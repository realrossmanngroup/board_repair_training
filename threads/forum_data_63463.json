Is this a correct resistance reading for this line? \n\nPlease save me from pulling anymore hair out.\n\nthanks"

Removed it and tested both incoming and outgoing on the board and short is now gone. However i do not have a spare <CHIP>U8250</CHIP> anywhere. The part number according to schematic is SLGAP1569V/SLG5AP1569 depending on what part you read, searching this brings up nothing on google apart from aliexpress etc. however i can find a  slg59m1558v which looks to be the exact same part.\nare you able to clarify this?\n\nthanks"
