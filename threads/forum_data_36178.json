Replaced the lvds connector due to corrosion but still no backlight. PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT measures @ 54.76v, PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD @ 5.017v. \n\nI've ohmed out the connection checking from the pads on the board to the other end of an lvds cable (not connected to the display). Also tried another display with the same outcome. \n\nAny idea what else could be causing the backlight to not come on?"}

Usually this is bad LCD connector, LCD cable, or screen. So in your case, inspect soldering on LCD connector and make sure it isn't burned."}

Since the backlight circuitry was working, looked into the display and found the backlight connector on the display was unplugged. Thanks a lot guys."}
