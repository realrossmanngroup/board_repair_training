[/QUOTE]\n\ndoes the same withot the BIL also replaced the ISL and stil no result though it does run on battery only if i disconnect the battery and connect the magsafe so fan spinning and reconnect the battery and disconnet the magsafe..when I do that and boot to system no battery installed messege, then disconnect magsafe the computer goes to sleep mode kinda getting dimmed to black screen fan spinning for aprox 1.5 min and fan stoppes."
