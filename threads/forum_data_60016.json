            "message": "Hello\n\nI have this logic board that originally came in with not powering from usb-c but from battery, and also not seeing SSD. Fixed the usb-c issue by replacing <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>/3100 and the ssd was due to <RESISTOR>R9350</RESISTOR> being knocked off. But now I'm dealing with fan spin issue. I slowly ramps up to high fan spin. unfortunately i didn't power on the board before fixing the other issues, so not sure if the fan issue was there previous. \n\nI also found <RESISTOR>R6051</RESISTOR> knocked off (for smc fan 1 control), replaced. \n\nTheres no sign of liquid damage or corrosion. I'm getting a 127 degree reading on HWMonitor app for Airport and Heatpipe Outgoing Air sensor. I've checked all 3 thermal sensors (<TRANSISTOR>Q5871</TRANSISTOR>/2/3) under diode mode and they all read 0.64 at <CHIP>U5870</CHIP> pins 6/7, 8/9, and 10/11.\n\nAny suggestions?"
