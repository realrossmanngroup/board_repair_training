The error given is, \"Child process exited due to signal. Usually a crash!\". There are no other errors, and the board ran Heaven GPU for 1 hour without any issues. I inspected the board and found no damage.\n\nIs this likely to progress into total memory failure? Should I disregard since the board works fine otherwise, even though it fails the test consistently and reliably? All help/input appreciated!"
