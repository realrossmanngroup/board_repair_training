No liquid damage, was dropped on its side and hasn't charged since then. Tried a known working DC board but same result. I tested with an el cheapo charger and it does charge, just not with my bench psu. U7000 has continuity to the Magsafe and voltages seem good (1 - 3.45v   4 - 3.42v   5  - 3.42v). Given that it charges fine with the shitty charger, is this a leakage issue like some of the previous forum threads? If so, how do I test to find the culprit?"}
