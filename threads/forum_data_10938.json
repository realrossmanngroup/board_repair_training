        "820-3462": "What is 820-3462? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SMC_DCIN_ISENSE": "What is SMC_DCIN_ISENSE? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "PPVCORE_S0_AXG": "What is PPVCORE_S0_AXG? This is vcore going to the CPUâ€™s integrated graphics processor for CPUs that have an integrated GPU. When this is missing on a device that has an integrated GPU and no discrete GPU, it usually means either no screen is detected, or the GPU integrated into the CPU is dead..",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on.."
