        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

Looking at the pads for the connector they don't look burnt or missing. \nHaving another look round the board there is a dab of liquid on top of <CHIP>U7310</CHIP> - but pins and area around look clean - this seems to deal with <SIGNAL>CPU_ISNS</SIGNAL> and is powered by <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> so probably not important if not getting to S4 ? - i may just ultrasonic this and see if that does anything and report back."
