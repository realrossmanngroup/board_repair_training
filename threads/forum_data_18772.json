Initially i cleaned and touched up the connector. After this did not change anything i removed the connector entirely. Looking at the pads for the connector they don't look burnt or missing. \nHaving another look round the board there is a dab of liquid on top of U7310 - but pins and area around look clean - this seems to deal with CPU_ISNS and is powered by PP5V_S0 so probably not important if not getting to S4 ? - i may just ultrasonic this and see if that does anything and report back."}

I do now get quarter fan spin which repeats. Same voltage jumping on PP5V_S4. Any further thoughts before it goes to the bottom of the pile ?"}
