If you have a short when the screen is plugged in to the CONNECTOR but NOT when plugged in, what do you think the Short is?\n\n2. You need a known good screen for testing get one.\n\n3. Make sure the short is gone once you replace the fuse and try the known good screen BEFORE you put power through to make sure the screen was the short not the connector?"}
