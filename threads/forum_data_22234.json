        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",

        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

I check continuity between the <RESISTOR>R6110</RESISTOR> <RESISTOR>R6120</RESISTOR> <RESISTOR>R6125</RESISTOR> to Probe 738 and all is connected and all have 3.3v. Could this be from the smc? the smc from the beginning looked like it had crap near/under it. also i am missing <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> and s3. any help is appreciated because i seem to have gotten my self stuck and not sure exactly what i should be testing from here."
