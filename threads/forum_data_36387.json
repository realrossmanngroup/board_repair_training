Have made lots of progress. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.23V.\nI don't have my 3.3V rail, but do have <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>. I notice if I diode mode to ground on L7220-1 I get 0.130. I have changed <TRANSISTOR>Q7220</TRANSISTOR> and also changed <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> a couple times. Once I change I do my diode mode reading and something like 0.300 something that looks more normal. But once I connect power it goes back down to 0.025 or something really low. So I am guessing something else to blame.\nMy general question is: should I change all of these at once? <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7220</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7260</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7261</TRANSISTOR>, & <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR>?"

Overworked, fatigued & stress I start to get stupid real fast.  Been on this one for 5 days and finally got it : )\nBut thank you for pointing me in the right direction. Yes, it makes a lot of sense now. So my dumb question actually bared more fruit than I thought! Thank you again!"
