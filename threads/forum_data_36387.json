Have made lots of progress. PPBUS_G3H is 3.23V.\nI don't have my 3.3V rail, but do have PP5V_S5. I notice if I diode mode to ground on L7220-1 I get 0.130. I have changed Q7220 and also changed U7200 a couple times. Once I change I do my diode mode reading and something like 0.300 something that looks more normal. But once I connect power it goes back down to 0.025 or something really low. So I am guessing something else to blame.\nMy general question is: should I change all of these at once? U7200, Q7220, Q7260, Q7261, & Q7221?"}

I did change ISL and resistors were way bad. I need to recheck the second set. I think it was around 3.0Ohms, so I assume they were good."}

I had a lot of work and lots of other questions. But I have figured them all out.  Thank you Duke.\nI apologize for being brain dead sometimes. Overworked, fatigued & stress I start to get stupid real fast.  Been on this one for 5 days and finally got it : )\nBut thank you for pointing me in the right direction. Yes, it makes a lot of sense now. So my dumb question actually bared more fruit than I thought! Thank you again!"}
