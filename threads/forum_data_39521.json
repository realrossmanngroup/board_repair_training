Board and also the rest of the machine look like new. CPU is getting hot, fan is spinning but no image (on internal LCD and external screen too) I checked: \nsys_pwrok = 3.4V,\nthe light on an external mouse is blinkin,\nS0_LCDBKL = 0V.\n noticed no voltage on l8300 and followrd this to U8330. I measured Pin 1,2,5,6 and they are all 0V (coming from the CPU) and they all are not shorted. Pin 8 = 3,34V, Pin 3,7 = 0V. Now i am stuck."}

I mean that the light is blinkin when the mouse is upside down. So its searching a surface. If i move my finger close to the sensor it stays on... Its hard to see the light on my test moust if ist on the table the right way...Sorry for that."}

I connected the speakers (both) but cant get it to chime. But cpu is getting warm and fan is spinning... PPVCC_S0_CPU = 1.76V. I am really confuesed  by this one. So maybe there cant be an image right now? Both enables (LCD_PSR_EN, EDP_PANEL_PWR) are low all the time."}
