        "message":"I have an A1278 2009 MBP that would not charge a battery. It will run off the battery, although the customer reported it suddenly powering off when on battery power.\nWhen the battery is plugged in not charging, the charger light remains green and never switches to Amber.\nWhen it is charging, the light turns Amber and estimates ~5h to charge from 52-100%.\n\n\nI tested with known good DCIN board, Battery, and charger.\nTested battery\/charger fuses and all current sensing resistors around ISL6258A.\n\nThere is no water damage nor notable corrosion anywhere on the board.\nI have an 820-2879 Donor, but I can order an 820-1530 donor if I need something specific (2879 has ISL6259, not ISL6258A if I need to replace that)\n\nAny ideas?\nI will leave the computer overnight to see if it charges completely. The customer recalled it only charging to somewhere near 50% when it stopped and came to us for warranty (originally battery swap).\n\n--Thanks"
