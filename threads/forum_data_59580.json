    "definitions": {
        "A1534": "What is A1534? A1534 is a model number for a 12 inch size Macbook  from years 2015, 2016 with EMC 2746, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00045, 820-00244..",
        "820-00045": "What is 820-00045? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8000": "What is U8000? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PP1V2_S3": "What is PP1V2_S3? PP1V2_S3 is a 1.2v power rail present when the machine is in an S3 suspend to RAM state.",
        "PP1V8_S3": "What is PP1V8_S3? The PP1V8_S3 signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that provides a voltage of 1.8 volts during the S3 power state. The S3 state, often referred to as \"suspend to RAM,\" is a low-power mode where the computer saves the session's state to RAM, allowing for quicker wake-up times compared to a full shutdown..",
        "PP1V05_SUS": "What is PP1V05_SUS? The PP1V05_SUS signal in the MacBook schematic is a power rail that supplies 1.05 volts, typically used in a suspended (SUS) state of the laptop. This state is a low-power mode where essential system functions are maintained, but the majority of the system is powered down..",
        "PP3V3R3V0_AON": "What is PP3V3R3V0_AON? PP3V3R3V0_AON is the first power rail you need to get a USB-C charger to go from 5v to 20v on an A1534 Macbook with an 820-00045 board..",
        "P3V3_S5": "What is P3V3_S5? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPDCIN_E85_SS": "What is PPDCIN_E85_SS? a SIGNAL.",

        "P3V3_S5_PHASE": "What is P3V3_S5_PHASE? a SIGNAL.",
        "PDDR_S3_PHASE": "What is PDDR_S3_PHASE? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state."

Previous owner said it just powered off and would not charge. The board negotiates 20V from a PD charger. This is not a power-in failure.\n\nI don't have an inline volt/amp meter for USB-C, so I continued by using a 5V Anker power bank (PD) and inline 5V meter to see amperage. There is no current draw, only a blip of 10mA every 15 seconds or so (without battery). With battery, the boards goes to 0.4A, shortly cuts out, then goes to 1.8A, which looks like it's charging fine.\n\nRails I have measured:\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_E85_SS</SIGNAL> is 20V on PD, 5.1V on Anker powerbank\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 8.6V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL> = 3.28V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> = 4.995V\n<SIGNAL>P5V_S4_PGOOD</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> = 0V (70K to gnd, goes to 0.07V three seconds after plugging in power, then gradually goes to 0V in about five seconds)\n<SIGNAL>P3V3_S5</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>P3V3_S5_PHASE</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP1V8_S3</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PDDR_S3_PHASE</SIGNAL> = 0V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> = 0V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_SUS</SIGNAL> = 1.05V\n\nConsidering that <SIGNAL>P3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is VIN for <CHIP>U8000</CHIP> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> is the trigger, <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> should be 3.3V (but isn't). <CHIP>U8000</CHIP> is not damaged.\n\nI am aware of the CPU failures. This is a personal laptop.\nWill be glad to look for more clues if needed."
