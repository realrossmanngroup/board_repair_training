        "message":"I'm troubleshooting this board that is in good condition, no liquids damage, no corrosion, no bad caps that I can see, nothing getting warm. Previous owner said it just powered off and would not charge. The board negotiates 20V from a PD charger. This is not a power-in failure.\n\nI don't have an inline volt\/amp meter for USB-C, so I continued by using a 5V Anker power bank (PD) and inline 5V meter to see amperage. There is no current draw, only a blip of 10mA every 15 seconds or so (without battery). With battery, the boards goes to 0.4A, shortly cuts out, then goes to 1.8A, which looks like it's charging fine.\n\nRails I have measured:\nPPDCIN_E85_SS is 20V on PD, 5.1V on Anker powerbank\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.6V\nPP3V3R3V0_AON = 3.28V\nPP5V_S4 = 4.995V\nP5V_S4_PGOOD = 3.3V\nPP3V3_S4 = 0V (70K to gnd, goes to 0.07V three seconds after plugging in power, then gradually goes to 0V in about five seconds)\nP3V3_S5 = 3.3V\nP3V3_S5_PHASE = 3.3V\nPM_SLP_S5_L = 3.3V\nPP1V2_S3, PP1V8_S3, PDDR_S3_PHASE = 0V\nPPVCC_S0_CPU = 0V\nPP1V05_SUS = 1.05V\n\nConsidering that P3V3_S5 is VIN for U8000 and PM_SLP_S5_L is the trigger, PP3V3_S4 should be 3.3V (but isn't). U8000 is not damaged.\n\nI am aware of the CPU failures. This is a personal laptop.\nWill be glad to look for more clues if needed."
