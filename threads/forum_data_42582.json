        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP.",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. ."

The clock chip is going up and down along with the SMC clock chip. G3H voltages are there. 3V SUS is present. <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> are there. When it cycles, everything comes up that I can think to check. I've replaced <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>. No change. Board was liquid-damaged most likely but it was cleaned before it got to me and nothing looks visibly burnt besides the <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> area which I cleaned up. Any ideas what would cause this?"
