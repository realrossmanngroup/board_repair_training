When you see KERNEL_TASK as a process taking up lots of CPU and the machine is working very slow or has loud fans, use a program like hwmonitor to check voltage, amperage, and temperature sensors and look for something that doesn’t look right.."

I injected 3.4V on L6995, put alcohol everywhere and found an issue with <CHIP>U6400</CHIP>. For the moment I only removed L6400, I don't have a spare to replace <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> yet.\nNow the board boots, internal display is ok, but very very slow to boot and to work. No battery installed. Activity monitor shows 89% used by the system.\nIn safe mode: same story, even more slow if possible, Activity monitor shows 95% used by the system.\nPRAM reset: no changes\nASD OS: Passed\nASD EFI: Passed\nI am almost sure that at a given moment with some SSD I saw <SIGNAL>KERNEL_TASK</SIGNAL> above 600%, but I am not able to reproduce that.\nHardware monitor: does not show high temperatures, fan is always around 2000rpm\nI swapped memory, SSD, same story.\nWhat could I do next?"
