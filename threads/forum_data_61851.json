Tried Revive first, checked with customer and got the green light on restoring it but I get a: System cannot be restrored on this device: amrestoreerrordomain error 6 failed to handle messag type statusmsg. I tried multiple times with host OS and configurator updated from both Big Sur and Catalina. I tried from Mojave but I didn't already have configurator on that load and apparently Apple requires 10.15 or greater to download. I have to assume host OS isn't that relevant considering if the target has Mojave but yet Configurator2 is no longer available for new download to Mojave to attempt as host for DFU restore."
