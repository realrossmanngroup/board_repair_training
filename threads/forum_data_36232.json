        "message":"I have this new 2016 machine(non-touchbar version) that had no liquid damage at all but won't turn on at all.\n\nI haven't worked on these models but I did check out some of Louis' videos on this model.\nI am only getting around 5v on PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS. I believe Louis said if you only get 5v you need to check PP3v3_G3h. I don't get any voltage on PP3V3_G3H and there is no short on that line.\nI get 0v on R3000\/01 but I was getting 3.3v on C3208\/3108 depending on which port the charger was plugged in.\n\nF3000\/3010 are working correctly and R5320\/21\/22 all measured the correct resistance.\n0v on L5001\/C5001.\n\nAlso, I am using a genuine apple charger."
