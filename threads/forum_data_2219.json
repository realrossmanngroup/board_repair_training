I have re-checked <SIGNAL>5V_S3</SIGNAL> and its shorted to ground.

At the moment my board is missing <SIGNAL>5V_S3</SIGNAL> and this line is not shorted to ground. My Meter on diode mode with red probe on gnd and red probe on <SIGNAL>5V_S3</SIGNAL> gives me 0.430 I tried to see to see if the computer would turn on  by injecting 5v into this line.

Hopefully you can clear up some things. At the moment I don't have <SIGNAL>5V_S3</SIGNAL>. I tried injecting 5v into this line to see if the computer starts up and it consumes 0.24amps. I noticed that <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is getting really warm when this occurs. I don't understand why there is a consumption on this line if I already removed the short on this line. Any idea? I have proceeded with troubleshooting this ic and I'm getting the following values  ENTRIP1 0v, EN0 1.71v, ENTRIP2 0.62v, PGOOD 0.13v, VIN 12.57v . Do you think my <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> is no good? I checked <SIGNAL>P5VS3EN_L</SIGNAL> on point 2 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR> and I have 2.26v. Does this mean my mosfet is not good? According to the schematics it looks like <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR> uses the same mosfet to generate entrip1&2. Please correct me if this is wrongThanks!"
