It has a green light on the charger (PPBUS_G3H 12.57v , PPDCIN_G3H 17.08v, PP3V42_G3H 3.46v) and 3.42v on SMC_ONOFF_L pads. After doing some visual inspection I noticed that that the FireWire port power switch circuitry is f*cked. Its missing Q4262 & F4260. Would this circuitry prevent the computer from booting up? From what I can see, 5v_s3 and 3v3_s3 are missing. Should the s3 state be present when the computer is off?"}

I have re-checked 5V_S3 and its shorted to ground. I tried injecting some voltage (no more than 3v) into this line but it's hard to determine the faulty component since it only consumes 0.18A at 3.0v. I noticed that is getting a little bit warm u4800. Should I add more voltage? Any recommendations? Thanks!"}

At the moment my board is missing 5v_s3 and this line is not shorted to ground. My Meter on diode mode with red probe on gnd and red probe on 5v_s3 gives me 0.430 I tried to see to see if the computer would turn on  by injecting 5v into this line. When I did this the fan spinned for a second and my PSU got stuck at 0.24A and 5v. Not sure what's going on here. Is my u7200 fried?"}

I'm a little bit confused thou! Hopefully you can clear up some things. At the moment I don't have 5v_s3. I tried injecting 5v into this line to see if the computer starts up and it consumes 0.24amps. I noticed that u7200 is getting really warm when this occurs. I don't understand why there is a consumption on this line if I already removed the short on this line. Any idea? I have proceeded with troubleshooting this ic and I'm getting the following values  ENTRIP1 0v, EN0 1.71v, ENTRIP2 0.62v, PGOOD 0.13v, VIN 12.57v . Do you think my u7200 is no good? I checked P5VS3EN_L on point 2 of Q7221 and I have 2.26v. Does this mean my mosfet is not good? According to the schematics it looks like q7221 uses the same mosfet to generate entrip1&2. Please correct me if this is wrongThanks!"}

It seems that u7200 was shorted. When i removed this ic i was able to inject no more than 3 v into this line without any consumption. I think ill Be able to restore pp5v_s3 after replacing this chip.
