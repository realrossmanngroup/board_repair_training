Can I safely inject voltage or do I first need to remove all U72xx? When just connecting the charger nothing gets hot. Nothing looks bad as well I visually checked all PPBUS IC's."

I removed all CPU Power IC with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL> connected and injected power, <CAPACITOR>C7078</CAPACITOR> was short and burned hole in the board. After making copper line and replacing it, I have PPBUS restored but one of the charge IC had 5v no amp the other one 0.25A, replaced the one without amp and got the mac working again. Thanks, now the other one :)"
