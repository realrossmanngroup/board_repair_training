Does anyone know if any of the older iMac 21.5 boards are close enough?  I mainly work on macbook pros and it seems the schematics don't change too much from year to year (just the board views).\n\nthanks,\nPaul"}

I removed some of the blown USB port chips but didn't want to go any further until I could check for STG\/etc.  No boot but I see a green light on the MB."}
