The customer really wanted his machine back, and since i could not show that his screen was not working properly i couldn't really refuse him.\n\nI suspect he will be back with the same issue, and i am wondering, could this be as simple as the lcd connector on the motherboard being rotten, or is this more a GPU issue? If anything, when he comes back, how do i diagnose a screen that is mostly working?"}
