Starts (goes through 3 start cycle correctly). chimes, turns on fully then 5 seonds later shuts amps down to 164ma.  Won't restart properly. Turn on, fan spin but no cycling and sits at 164ma or so.\n\nLeave it off for 10 mins and we are back to the beginning and it starts, chimes and then drops to around170ma.\n\nIf you turn it off and DON'T wait the 10 mins or so, it will not trun on at all and sits at 23ma (missing 5v rail?)\n\nStrangest one I have had yet.\n\nAll rails correct when on. 5v, 3.3, 1.2, 1.05, 3.42 & 1.8v. No idea what this is.\n\nSeems that when it has cooled down we are fine. So somthing failing when hot? But what?"
