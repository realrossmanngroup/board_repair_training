            "message": "Hi Duke / Louis,\nI received a Macbook Air which was not turning ON.  Customer complained that her daughter spilled very little liquid on it.  I opened the computer and also watched a video by Louis that how a trackpad can make a Macbook Air not turn on.  I followed the instructions and saw that there was a corrosion under the trackpad and also discovered that the cable those are connected to the trackpad, not the one that goes to the keyboard and the logic board, but the two cables that are on the side of the trackpad, out of which one was cut.  So I decided to change the trackpad which I bought a new trackpad, with which the computer comes on but now the trackpad pointer keeps jumping and different places, and sometimes it stops working.  The click does not work.  Other than the corrosion there is no corrosion anywhere on the board.  What else can I check in order to make the trackpad work.  Please advice."

The trackpad and the keyboard does not respond.  I connected an external keyboard and a mouse to the Macbook Air and when I go to System Preferences and click Trackpad, it says that the Trackpad was not found.  When I go to Language & Region, then the Macbook Air detects the external keyboard when it asks to press keys next to the Shift Key.  Can anyone advice where to look for in order to make the Trackpad and the Keyboard working again."
