            "message": "Hello guys,  i'm working on a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3787</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that was completely dead. Here is the story, customer brought this mac into my shop said it was working fine until they removed the bottom cover something sparked. Anyways never got the truth, but i saw that right near the in-rush limiter was completely fucked almost burnt a hole in the board. So i replaced all the burned components pin1 of <RESISTOR>R7185</RESISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7185</CAPACITOR> was completely smoked burning the trace under the inrush limiter. So i ran a jumper replaced the components got a green light but still would not turn on. So i poked around the board and lost dcin completely its below 1v like 0.7xx so i tested the dcin board in a different computer works tried a different charger works any ideas on what could be the issue here?"
