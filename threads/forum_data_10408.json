Here is the story, customer brought this mac into my shop said it was working fine until they removed the bottom cover something sparked. Anyways never got the truth, but i saw that right near the in-rush limiter was completely fucked almost burnt a hole in the board. So i replaced all the burned components pin1 of r7185 and c7185 was completely smoked burning the trace under the inrush limiter. So i ran a jumper replaced the components got a green light but still would not turn on. So i poked around the board and lost dcin completely its below 1v like 0.7xx so i tested the dcin board in a different computer works tried a different charger works any ideas on what could be the issue here?"}

What do you think?"}
