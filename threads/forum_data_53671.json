        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "LCDBKLT_BOOST": "What is LCDBKLT_BOOST? LCDBKLT_BOOST is connected to the SWITCH(SW) pin of the LED driver and is switched to ground quickly after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit that boosts PPBUS_G3H to backlight voltage for the screen. .",
        "R7717": "What is R7717? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7722": "What is R7722? a RESISTOR.",
        "C7799": "What is C7799? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C7797": "What is C7797? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C7796": "What is C7796? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C7712": "What is C7712? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C7713": "What is C7713? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C7793": "What is C7793? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "Q7707": "What is Q7707? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",
        "R7704": "What is R7704? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. ."

            "message": "The Hell has ended.  It was a compound problem.  Bad board & bad DC-IN.   The board had a bad backlight.  I tested it on the bench with a test monitor and my DC-IN.  it was bad.  Not sure what fixed it.  <CHIP>U7701</CHIP>, or the VIA.   When I put it in the machine the DC-IN was bad on top of it so I was chasing my tail around.   Originally I had tested with my test DC-IN and the back light didn't work.  When It worked on the bench it failed in the unit.  When I threw in my test board it worked but I didn't hook up the ribbon.   I never put two and two together and was chasing my tail round and round.   It wasn't until I gave up on the machine and swapped the board,  changed it's SN and then discovered it was doing the same thing that I realized I was making assumptions about the DC-IN. \n\nWhat made this so hard to figure out was how intermittent the DC-IN failure was on top of it all!  Because it worked on the bench I was not surprised because it was very intermittent.  I never once thought the DC-IN.  I couldn't get it to fail long enough to measure!  \n\nI sure feel stupid!\n\nThanks John and 2informaticos for the guidance."
