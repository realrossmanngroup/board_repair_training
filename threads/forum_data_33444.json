I thought these boards were supposed to be amber when no battery is present. Anyhow, if I attach a discharged battery then it turns amber and charges it. SMC reset also works. Any Ideas where to start? I can usually fix most boards but this model seems a lot more complicated or different than the others. \n\nAlso, I see that some of the caps around <TRANSISTOR>Q7510</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7550</TRANSISTOR> area are corroded. Also, <CHIP>U5010</CHIP>.\n\nAdapter sense fluctuates between 3.2v and 3.33v\nDCIN 18v5 flucuates between 16.42v and 16.78v\nPP3v42 at 3.39v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> very low at 1.1v\n\nI've replaced ISL twice just in case and same result.
