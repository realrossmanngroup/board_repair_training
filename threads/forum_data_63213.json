            "message": "I have one of the awful 12\" MacBooks that came in for repair.  Customer puled the bottom off for a battery replacement and damaged the KB/Trackpad connector and cable. Everything besides KB and trackpad worked fine. I used it for a few days through a USB dock with USB KB/Mouse and HDMI monitor.  \n I removed the connector from the board and put a new one one. Ever since then i get no display internal or external, and no USB power/activity. I removed the connector and put it aside just to be sure its not the conenctor/internalKB/trackpad. \n\nI have measured tons of points and everything i would normally check is coming back fine. CPU VCORE is normal, 3v3 AON is normal.  CPU heats up as i would expect, it even responds to the power button pads on the board (grounding will power it off, grounding again will power it on. As evidenced by watching the wattage the charger is pulling from the wall).  \n\n The only thing i am finding missing so far is the 5V on l7850.  The enable for this is missing. If i force the <SIGNAL>ENABLE_L</SIGNAL> to a low state on <TRANSISTOR>Q4635</TRANSISTOR> that 5V will appear on l7850.  With that 5V present the USBc dock still does not work for USB or HDMI. I imagine there is some muxing supposed to be happening that is not. \n\nSDA and SCL on <CHIP>U4650</CHIP> appear to working at least somewhat.  I can watch data and clock happen with my scope on boot up. That said i have no way to know what data if any is being exchanged. It is bi-directional so maybe those lines are sending data but receiving no data back to set that enable low? \n\nAs far as i can tell all chips involved in the sequence are powered by 3v3 AON and are getting 3.3V to their VCC.  \n\nI know these things tend to have dead CPUs, but this one seems like a lot is actually going on for it to be a dead CPU.  \n\nAny advice appreciated, Data is important to owner otherwise i would replace the board and get it out of here."

            "message": "So it gets even stranger.  It seems like <SIGNAL>VR_READY</SIGNAL> may actually be present, but goes away and shuts down the board when i try to measure it.  If i measure with a multimeter i never get anything, if i leave a scope on it while its booting <SIGNAL>VR_READY</SIGNAL> will go high for maybe 3 seconds, then go low, then board shuts down (as evidenced by the power meter between the charger and AC).  If i try to measure while the board is running, as soon as i touch a probe to <RESISTOR>R0850</RESISTOR>, or the <SIGNAL>VR_READY</SIGNAL> test point on the board i can see the board switch from pulling around 7-11W to 0.8W and remain that way until i unplug and plug it back in. \n\nSo somehow the act of measuring the signal is causing it to go low, i guess?\n\nIn normal circumstances that <SIGNAL>VR_READY</SIGNAL> signal should be constantly high, yes?\n\nIf i take <RESISTOR>R0850</RESISTOR> out of circuit power stays at 0.8W and he board does not appear to power on.     Other side of <RESISTOR>R0850</RESISTOR> is around 1V.  Which while would normally seem low to me for an enable, appears to be typical of other measurements i have seen posted.\n\nI do not think this is the case, but lets assume somehow the LCD, LCD connector, or LCD Cable got damaged during disassembly/reassembly. Is there any signal that would be present while the board is fully running/booted/in the OS, but while the LCD is unplugged?   To be clear, there is no evidence of damage to any of those parts, im just trying to prove the board is actually booting fully, with the next thought being maybe i can get it into Target Disk mode to get data somehow.\n\nI am even getting the Enables high for BTPWR and WifiPWR,  though it does not appear to be pulling a DHCP ip/lease from my server.\nNot sure if i mentioned, but i also have 3.3V on ALLSYSPWRGOOD as well."
