PPBUS has fluctuated between 12.25 and 12.59V\n\nReplace U7000 and R7005 but still have same issue. Noticed I have short on PPBUS_G3H. When R5400 is removed the short is gone. I have replaced R5400 two times now and each time it is replaced, the short returns.\n\nDoes this board sound like it has a short in the board itself at this point?"}
