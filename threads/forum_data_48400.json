PPBUS has fluctuated between 12.25 and 12.59V\n\nReplace <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> but still have same issue. Noticed I have short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. When <RESISTOR>R5400</RESISTOR> is removed the short is gone. I have replaced <RESISTOR>R5400</RESISTOR> two times now and each time it is replaced, the short returns.\n\nDoes this board sound like it has a short in the board itself at this point?"
