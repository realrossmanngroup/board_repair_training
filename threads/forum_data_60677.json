Worked prior but didn't work after install. \nQ3730 was knocked off and has been replaced. \n\nppbus_g3h - 13v\nGood until pp3v3_s4 and pp5v_s4 - 0v. No short. (same before q3730 replaced). \np3v3_sus - 3.4v\nr7020 - 20v\n\nDrawing 19v .06 amps but after about 15 seconds it spikes to .22a. \n\nWhen battery is connected it appears to charge and climbs to 2a. \nq7030 & L7030 get hot and u3100 gets hot when using corresponding port. u3200 does not get hot when in use. Neither hot without batt. \n                   \nNo response to smc bypass. \nOnly other thing that shows on thermal is u3900 which only blips."}
