Then I saw corrosion in the lvds area around <TRANSISTOR>Q4262</TRANSISTOR>. Replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q4262</TRANSISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R4262</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R4263</RESISTOR> (those are for firewire) and then I replaced LVDS connector.\n\nNow I have backlight, white screen, but no image. Tried different screens with same resault.\nWhere do I start"
