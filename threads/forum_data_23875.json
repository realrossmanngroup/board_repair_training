After looking at the board i found that C7524 was ripped off so I replaced it. Then I saw corrosion in the lvds area around Q4262. Replaced Q4262, R4262, R4263 (those are for firewire) and then I replaced LVDS connector.\n\nNow I have backlight, white screen, but no image. Tried different screens with same resault.\nWhere do I start"}
