I can see the backlight is on but nothing  on screen. No signs of liquid damage. When I plug in the charge I do get an audible tone like when plugging in an iPad. Trying to decide if this is an image problem or a no booting problem."}

While the board seems ok the screen looks great, when I close the display just enough for the screen to turn off and reopen it, the screen goes blank but can see backlight is on. I have to restart the machine to get the image to show up but it comes back every time. Seems like a worn out display cable to me."}
