            "message": "Hi all,\n\nI need some assistance with a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01598</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A. The board was left on the roof of the previous owners car and he drove off forgetting it was there and drove over it. I bought it off him and when I opened it up it was still running, no screen activity though probably because it was shattered and the keyboard desk is cracked on the sides. Tried to hold the power button but it would not respond so I had to disconnect the battery. I then plugged in my USB c meter and the board was drawing19.93V 0.0035a. I disconnected everything removed the board from the chassis and board by itself still pulling19.93V 0.0035a.\n\nI then Spoke to a friend of mine who asked me to check the following:\nUSB C meter: 14.779V 0.0143-173a. (Yes different to above.)\nPPBUS @ F7000 = 12.6V without battery.\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> @ F3001 = 14.7 and steady not fluctuating. These were made with a 29w apple charger. I was then told to get a 98w apple charger and re measure which returned:\nUSB c meter: 20.568V @ 0.0372A. The protocol is listed as QC2.0 20V.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> @ F7000 = 12.56V and steady.\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> @ F3001 = 20.54V.\n\nI then went down the power sequence diagram and checked all the rails are present. Stupid me did not write them down but I think I got about half way down the list. I then left it for a while as I was going mad. I came back and prodded around the ISL. I sprayed some 99% IPA on it and the caps around it to see what gets hot and boom now I cannot get above 5V and ppbusg3h is now 300ma as is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL>. I’ve checked those two rails and nothing seems shorted in the Kohm or Mohm range. I checked <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> again no shorts in the Mohm range but 0v.I’ve also noticed the USB c amp meter says Samsung protocol now not QC 2.0  like it use to. It’s drawing 70-84ma at 5.168v but fluctuates. Lastly I hooked up the battery to see if that will change anything but still the same. It seems like the isl has crapped the bucket but wanted to get some advise before I go changing it. The fuses on both <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> show 5V. One thing I’ve noticed now is whenever I put the USB c charger on the top port when the cpu side is facing upwards the USB c meter turns off so it seems like it’s detecting a short and turning off. The second port it runs fine. This was not happening before.\n\nI don’t think it’s the ISL though as it’s not getting hot. The component on the flip side of the board in the same spot as the isl is slightly, very slightly. As are some of the large tants and <CHIP>U6390</CHIP> but again only slightly it takes quite a few minutes for the ipa to evaporate so it’s hard to tell if theres A short or if there just simply warming up because their on and working normally. Especially since whenever I try to measure something everything’s in the Kohm or Mohm range.\n\nBTW: I have not tried DFU recovery. I do not have any working macs atm. I did try hook it up to a windows pc running iTunes but it did not detect anything not sure if it should. Also on the USB c meter I can occasionally get it to go up to 158ma so I do not think it’s a dfu issue. This happens very rarely though, I have to reset the charger and 99% of the time when doing that it sits on 80 or so instead of 158. \n\nthanks for your assistance let me know if you need any further info."

I did try the 29w when I first saw the 20v drop but it made no difference so I’ve stuck with the 98w as I was told the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2159</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> won’t turn on unless you use a 65w or greater.\n\nThere seems to be a short or open line I’m more leaning to on the board or something because when I just went to measure both sides said 0. Had to go back and forth a few times than check the fuse next to the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> which measured 5.16v to get the above reading. USB c meter never dropped sits on 5.16 and 70-87ma fluctuating so it’s not a supply issue. \n\nWith the USB c meters for the protocol what should it say if the communication is working correctly? At first when I was getting the 20v it was saying QC2.0 but now it says Samsung.\n\nis it worth removing the T2 shield and doing a visual inspection? Considering this is crush damage it’s likely a large bga has cracked solder balls which would explain the intermittent readings but no shorts showing. Only shield I’ve removed so far is thunderbolt."

I thought 30 air flow would be enough to prevent that but it was still too high. It’s awkward because of my Barlow lens I do not have enough work room to be able to go in straight with the hot air gun, I have to go at a angle which makes take off more likely.\n\nI’m measuring 4.7 ohm on <RESISTOR>R7075</RESISTOR>. The schematic also says 4.7 with no designator at the end, so that should be fine. My understanding is resistors only fail high so if it was bad we would be at least in the k ohm range.

When I poured ipa on the board at the start of this thread I noticed the board itself getting hot first, where there were no components so it looks like there may be a short internally. Though this was after applying power for a few minutes, normally internal board shorts run bloody hot this was more like luke warm at best."

A friend told me to check <RESISTOR>R7191</RESISTOR> as he has had it cause him issues in the past. Is that suppose to be a 0 ohm resistor or 2.7 ohm? The schematic on bad caps says 2.7 but the schematic from xin zhi zao says zero.\n\n I originally only had the one from xin zhi zao so when I measured it I saw 2.8k. Thought hmmm if that was blown it should be higher than that. Checked at other things couldn’t find anything so I removed it. Now first boot was 5v 500ma than the USB meter reset and went to 20v 0.4744 amps and fluctuating slightly. If I use the second port towards the battery connector the meter turns off and stays off, so back to the earlier behaviour.\n\nPPBUS at F7000 is 12.53 volts so we’re making progress finally! Looked around at a few other rails can’t see any shorts anywhere. Which boards have replacements for <RESISTOR>R7191</RESISTOR>? According to my schematics the 8P, 6,XS, 3437 and 165 have zero of these on them which I find very hard to believe! And according to the schematic the 1598 has only <RESISTOR>R7191</RESISTOR>."

I’ll hook up the battery and test but just want to make sure it’s safe to do so with that resistor missing."

            "message": "Ah ok that explains it thanks did not know that. I think I’m going to replace all the glass looking diodes. First few are cracked, missing and the rest bar the top one are reading both ways so they look like their blown. Probably change all of them just to be safe.\n\nNot yet no the missing resistor has been left off. I don’t have any around it’s ratings so I’ve ordered some.How can I check if the CD is ok? I checked resistance to ground both on the resistor before it and the test pad and they were 380k so it’s not shorted to ground. That doesn’t always mean it’s ok though. If it is dead where can we source them? Last I heard there like the ISL 9240. I’ll have a look at Ali express but don’t know if there legit or not like you said with the 9240s.\n\nI’ve taken a few photos if you want to reference them of the USB c connector and the diodes sections.\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://ibb.co/vcTFsS0[/URL]\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://ibb.co/yn0jZT2[/URL]\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://ibb.co/2sjv6gN[/URL]\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://ibb.co/5RkJR1r[/URL]\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://ibb.co/NKW5CQK[/URL]"
