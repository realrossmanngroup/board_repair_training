Reflashed BIOS with a clean one found on this forum (serial changed + checksum fixed) on a different chip and it came to life. Started a Big Sur install, crashed while loading the installer and now it's looping; fans spin for a while and it seems to reset, no backlight.\n\nI think it's got itself corrupted again. Likely bad CPU\/PCH?\n----\nUPDATE: Hmm, it now seems to work somewhat again. Will try another battery to rule out problems with that."
