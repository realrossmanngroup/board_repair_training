Only things i've found so far is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> reading 2.8 and the ssd chips are warm (not hot), but the red spot in the picture is ready about 104 degrees (F). So i ran the board through the ultrasonic just case there were some hidden corrosion, no change in temp or voltage reading of <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>. With lifeboat board taken out, the ssd isn't warm anymore. <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> is 5.1.\n\nother measurements noticed in comparison to another board with other issues is LA640 and 650 are both reading 1.8ohm and on the another board i get 4ohms. Not sure if this means sometime\n\nAny suggestions"

With L2950 pulled, pin 1 reads 1.20ohms while pin 2 which also ties back to <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> reads 40ohms.\nBefore i pull this chip, any suggestion on what stencil to get for this chip and possibly where i can get it?\nCan I remove this chip/disable it and the board still run, just without J3300 and if so, do you happen to know how to disable it so it's not looked at by the system?"
