I have listed the different measurements below but I don't know where to check now. The charger light is green for a few seconds then turns orange (I don't know if this matters). I do not have a fan spin when I plug in the board to the charger. Also, do these boards automatically power on when connected to a charger or do I need to short two pins to get it to start?\n\nWhen I plug in a USB mouse and plug the board into the magsafe, I the USB mouse does not light up.
