        "message":"So I'm now on my 5th successful board repair. 1 easy and the rest have been hard but I'm making progress and confidence is building.\n\nSo this board is liquid damaged.\n\nThere was a short on PP3V42. There were also shorts when testing pins on U7100. Rookie mistake but I didn't note down the pins that showed a short but believe they were Pins 17+18 and 27+28 and possibly one more.\n\nI tested DCIN on the DCIN board before doing any work and it was a steady 14.4v.\n\nI couldn't see any obvious damage around the board so I removed U7100 but the short persisted so I injected 3.3v to see what got hot. I only had the supply on for 5-10 seconds and I could smell something bad so I turned it off and re-inspected the board. Still no obvious damage to anything but on retesting PP3V42, the short had gone and so had any shorts that were on the pins around U7100.\n\nI put a brand new U7100 on and tested again but now DCIN on the DCIN board is unsteady and flicks between 0-3v and then gives up after 10-20 seconds. I checked U7100 and reflowed to make sure it was good. I have taken off U7100 again and a steady 14.4v returns.\n\nJust tested Pin3 on U7100 and it's  3.8v. This chip is currently off the board.\n\nResistance between 17+18 is 3.7ohm\n\nResistance between 27+28 is 20ohm\n\nI'm stuck with what to do next..."

I thought it was from that area but couldn't be sure. Also explains no green light. New DC IN Board and Flex cable ordered. Can't find J9500 on ebay so will have to swap from a donor. Thanks for all your help so far. I'm hoping that replacing these parts will resolve everything."
