The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely.

There were also shorts when testing pins on <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>. Rookie mistake but I didn't note down the pins that showed a short but believe they were Pins 17+18 and 27+28 and possibly one more.\n\nI tested DCIN on the DCIN board before doing any work and it was a steady 14.4v.\n\nI couldn't see any obvious damage around the board so I removed <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> but the short persisted so I injected 3.3v to see what got hot. I only had the supply on for 5-10 seconds and I could smell something bad so I turned it off and re-inspected the board. Still no obvious damage to anything but on retesting PP3V42, the short had gone and so had any shorts that were on the pins around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>.\n\nI put a brand new <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> on and tested again but now DCIN on the DCIN board is unsteady and flicks between 0-3v and then gives up after 10-20 seconds. I checked <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and reflowed to make sure it was good. I have taken off <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> again and a steady 14.4v returns.\n\nJust tested Pin3 on <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and it's  3.8v. This chip is currently off the board.\n\nResistance between 17+18 is 3.7ohm\n\nResistance between 27+28 is 20ohm\n\nI'm stuck with what to do next..."
