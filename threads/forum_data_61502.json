When you connect to external monitor, both internal and external  displays work fine. works fine with \nonly external as well. but it freezes with internal display only. tried to different screens and also  putting the MLB to known working top case and screen still same. I replaced all CPU mosfets with new mosfets still the same.  Any advice really appreciate."}

Anyway I replaced these 3 chips and seems they are woking fine as I get 1.7+ V , on coils.\nIs there any relation other than iGPU between screen  connector and external display?"}

Thought to share the repair as it useful for others. \nIssue was with Q2010, LCD HDP inverter.  DP_IG_A_HPD_L signal was missing. I pulled Q2010 and found pad was completely burnt. Had to run a wire. all good. So this is solved. I have other one 820-00163 which I'm going to open a new threat. Thank you very much for your support."}

Mouser has FDMF6708N and FMDF3030 which are compatible though.\nThe stuff on Aliexpress is never new, pulled from dead board so of course it must not be used in this case."}
