When you connect to external monitor, both internal and external  displays work fine. works fine with \nonly external as well. but it freezes with internal display only. tried to different screens and also  putting the MLB to known working top case and screen still same. I replaced all CPU mosfets with new mosfets still the same.  Any advice really appreciate."

Thought to share the repair as it useful for others. \nIssue was with <TRANSISTOR>Q2010</TRANSISTOR>, LCD HDP inverter.  <SIGNAL>DP_IG_A_HPD_L</SIGNAL> signal was missing. I pulled <TRANSISTOR>Q2010</TRANSISTOR> and found pad was completely burnt. Had to run a wire. all good. So this is solved. I have other one <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00163</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> which I'm going to open a new threat. Thank you very much for your support."
