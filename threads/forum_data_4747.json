However now I plug the charger in and the fan doesn't spin anymore. If you stare at the fan, you will see it kind of barely \"wiggle\" constantly.\n\nIt does look like there is still a short to ground on <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> as both sides of the inductor in that circuit (at work can't remember if it actually labeled L7630) are showing a short to ground, diode measurement of 0.000 and 0.002. I plan on removing the inductor and seeing which side the short is on. At this point I would almost guess it will be on the computer side (not the side to the left of the inductor)\n\nIf I find that the short is on the right side, if I place 0.5v at the inductor pad, something should get warm, correct? I also wouldn't want to go higher than the 1.05v, correct, since I believe this goes to the CPU or GPU?\n\nThanks for any feedback!"
