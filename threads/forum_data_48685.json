There is no signs of water damage on the board, when I connect the charger the magsafe LED turns on green then amber and stays like that, there is no signs of shortage anywhere, all power lines that are \"always present\" according to the schematics are there, PP5V_S5, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S4 and other are there as well but then all goes to 0v after couple of seconds once magsafe LED turns amber (power lines \"always present\" are still present) . Anyone have any idea what could be wrong or what could I check next?\nThank you in advance."}
