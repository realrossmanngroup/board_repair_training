        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",

Never repaired before...\n\nAnyway... \nNo post, No usb activity ,machine turns on , green and amber light , no fan spin but I assume that is normal on this model.\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> drop to low once and then says high. Cpu get warm after a while.\nFan goes high speed on SMC bypass but nothing happens.\n\nI checked all the SPI lines and all resistors and everything is OK.\nAlso tried a good bin file and another chip from same model of donor board.\nNo signs of liquid damage or whatsoever... Everything seems in good shape.\n\nAny clues?"
