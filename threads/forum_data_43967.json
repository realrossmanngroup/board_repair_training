All boards are perfectly clean with no history of drop/liquid/etc. They all came in with similar descriptions, \"stopped powering on\". I have tried loading new BIOS's on a few of the boards, and it didn't help, so I put the original back on each. No shorts found across all coils, nothing getting hot except CPU (gets appropriately warm, etc). They all power on with trackpad click, fan spin, but no chime/boot/video, etc.\n\nI'm working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board now, measurements below:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>: 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: 13.06v\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>: 3.22v\n<SIGNAL>PP2V9_SYSCLK</SIGNAL>: 3.0v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V1_RTC</SIGNAL>: 3.09v\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S0_L</SIGNAL>: 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>GTVR_FCCM</SIGNAL>: .022v\nUSB Mouse light flickers for literally .1 seconds then no activity.\n\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS</SIGNAL> looks very slightly low, but everything else looks fine. CPU gets warm as normal, but no chime/boot/etc. Any ideas?\n\nThanks in advance!"
