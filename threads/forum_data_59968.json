With <DIODE>D7050</DIODE> removed, it does the same thing on voltage reading and has same diode reading. \nThis is interesting because before the SMC replacement, both voltages, though the were low (not 3.4), they were steady and not bouncing about. I did have a very low resistance measurement at the time, in the ohms level and not the 11kohm level that i'm at now. Wondering if this smc is defective as well. Before i go buying another set of donor boards, is there anything else i should check?\n\nBattery profile so \"no\" for battery connected.\n\nAnd i did try with a new battery also."
