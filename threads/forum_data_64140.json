I've read the BIOS and replaced all contents between $SVS with FF. When i try and boot the MacBook it still shows the padlock, when i read the BIOS again all the information between $SVS has returned. \n\nI tried to replace it again and after writing the data back to the chip, i checked that all the contents had gone, and it had, but it's still showing the padlock sign.\n\nI can't get it to do a PRAM (4 key combo keys on start) but it will do an SMC reset. When i load to recovery, it's waiting for the 6 digit number to be entered and locks after 3 attempts with a 60 minute waiting time.\n\nWhat am i doing wrong? is there a different method with the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>."

To recap the problem when changing the values between the $SVS to FF after starting the Macbook it would re-write the values back, hence not allowing you to do a PRAM as the lock was back. \n\nSo i found another BIOS from a donor board which didn't have any lock on it and copied the values between $SVS and bingo it worked. It removed the lock and allowed me to install a fresh copy of the OS.\n\nI don't know if it's just because this is an <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> or the SSD was blank with no OS on it. ( not sure how that happened)\n\nAnyway this might be helpful for others who are struggling to get the lock removed."

In this instance, after replacing the hext digits with 'FF', the 'bunch of crap' is added by the system when you power on the Macbook. So to get round this problem i added the  'bunch of crap' from a non-locked donor <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1707</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> macbook."
