        "message":"MacBook came in with fake charger, R6920 was burned, U7000 and U4650 were shorted, those got replaced, but still no light on charger. One thing I cannot figure out is why PPDCIN_G3H shows OL and on a working board I get 0.678 when measuring in diode mode. R7045 and R7086 are both good, from there I don't know where to go.\n\nThanks!"
