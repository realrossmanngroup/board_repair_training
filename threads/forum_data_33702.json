I have a Macbook Pro Mid 2016, 13\" here (non-touchbar) with a tripping keyboard backlight after top case replacement.\n\nThe top case was replaced after water damaged the keyboard and all the components such as the battery and trackpad were safely moved over to the new top case.\nApple diagnostics pass and the system doesn't seem to have any issues, expect that the keyboard backlight does not work properly\n\nI've made a video here: [URL]https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KJyRKo23h3w[\/URL]\n\nThe keyboard does stay at the same fixed brightness but the individual keys go on and off depending on the keyboard brightness thats set at the system. If you change the keyboard brightness some keys will turn off while others turn on. The keys that turn on\/off are always the same for each brightness setting, meaning that for example when you're at \"full brightness\" you will always be missing the same keys.\n\nIs this a motherboard problem or a keyboard problem? I hope the first because I really don't want to go through the process of getting everything out of the top case again :(\n\nCheers"}
