            "message": "Have seen two Touchbar boards in the past few weeks, each with the same symptoms: Zero damage to the board, 20v on USB-C input, but 0a and 0w being drawn. Have not seen this prior to these 2 units, but now both are showing this symptom. Have confirmed it's not a charger issue (other boards work just fine with it).\n\nIs there some common issue that causes this symptom? If not, what does this specific power state indicate? The first one had an issue with missing <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> that was being pulled low. Haven't even taken this most recent unit apart yet, but am not looking forward to another perfectly-clean board with no shorts or obvious damage, yet 0a/0w being drawn. I will create a new thread once I have some measurements available, but just wanted to get any information on this upfront. Has anyone had to replace a dead <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>? Suspecting a possible issue there. I've read and heard numerous times that having 20V on USB-C input generally indicates all <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s are OK--is this always true?"
