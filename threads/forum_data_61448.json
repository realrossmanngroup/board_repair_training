            "message": "Hi there.\n\nI successfully repaired this board a few days ago after it failed to power on. There was excessive buildup of corrosion around the SMC as well as a few other components. I had to repair traces and replace multiple damaged capacitors and resistors using a donor board. What finally got it up and running was a reflow of the SMC. I reinstalled the board and ran full diagnostics and it passed with flying colors. This lasted about a week.\n\nThe Mac was brought back in today having issues with extremely slow performance. I diagnosed a batterry issue after it ran well while plugged into a charger. Unfortunatlety now it wont run off battery at all. As soon as you pull the plug it immediatley shuts off. Battery is recognized and charging while plugged in. Swapping out with other good battery produced same result. I pulled the board and its not staying powered on with battery. Charger connected works fine.\n\nI tested voltages and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is a steady 8.16v on battery, 3.41v for PP3V42. I am not sure what to look for next. None of the 5V or 3V voltages are present."
