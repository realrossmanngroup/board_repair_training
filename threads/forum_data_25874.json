If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

            "message": "I finally got around to replacing the SMC again. When removing the previous one, I noticed that three balls had merged. That may have happened during removal, but I probably bumped the SMC too hard when trying to see if the solder had melted while placing it. The merged balls were: <SIGNAL>LPC_AD</SIGNAL><0>, <SIGNAL>LPC_AD</SIGNAL><2> and <SIGNAL>SMC_WAKE_SCI_L</SIGNAL>\n\nI grabbed another SMC from a donor board, reballed and placed that. Machine would now power on with quarter fan spin. Magsafe light slightly blinking. Every now and then it would go full fan spin, but no beep from speakers. Most of the time its just an endless loop of quarter fan spin.\n\nI first wanted to rule out having messed up the SMC again so decided to replace it yet again, just to see if the behaviour would be the same. This time there were no merged balls when lifting the SMC, and placing the next one went smooth. The board is acting the same as with the second SMC, so I'm assuming the problem is somewhere else. Might be because of the first SMC job, or because there is simply another issue with the board.\n\nSome measurements I took:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 12.58V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BCACOK</SIGNAL> = 3.27V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> = 3.4V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> = 3.45V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> = 3.4V\nL7510 = 0V\n\n[B]Resistance to ground because of the previously merged SMC balls:[/B]\n<SIGNAL>LPC_AD</SIGNAL><0> to ground is about 230KOhm    \n<SIGNAL>LPC_AD</SIGNAL><2> to ground is 7.18MOhm    \n<SIGNAL>SMC_WAKE_SCI_L</SIGNAL> to ground starts at 1k and goes up quickly"
