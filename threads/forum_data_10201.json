If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

            "message": "830-3437 - Orange Light, VCore present, Fan spin, SPI Working --> no Chime & Video\n\nI really hope this isn't one of those embarrassing issues where I just overlooked something haha\n\nAnyways, this macbook Air was water damaged and already bought to another company who told \"they would need to replace the motherboard as it can't be repaired\", I did not notice a lot of corrosion but I did notice some rusty parts and blackness/discolouration on the two backlight power pins of the display connector. (And a blown F7700, it no longer blows after replacement though).\n\nWhen you plug in the charger it becomes green for about one second, before it turns Orange. (No battery inserted). The CPU fan will switch on/off for about 3-4 times for about 4 seconds until it keeps on spinning. There is no Chime\nSystem responds to pressing the power button and shuts down by keeping it pressed or starts by pressing it just once.\n\nCPU Vcore is 1.75V, the CPU gets warm after keeping it on for a while.\n\nAll major power lines are available and at their voltages, SPI chip has both Input and Output communication (Seen with oscilloscope)\n\nWhen plugging in the battery <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> drops from 8.8V to 6.8V, I don't think this is intended. System does not run off battery, although the battery might just be empty. Possible issue in the power circuit?\n\nNo backlight (<SIGNAL>BKLT_PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL> signal is Low. The pins on <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> look awful but the chip responds as expected. Pin 3&4 (Gate & Source) are about the same voltage), No Keyboard backlight etc.\n\nA lot of the components positive power pin(s) look slightly bad, but this is probably because corrosion usually starts on the positive terminal. Power still goes through them properly and the solder connections are not broken.\n\nSummery:\nCPU Vcore = 1.75V\nSPI Chip I/O activity\nDoesn't run off battery, when having a battery plugged in <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> drops from 8.8V to ~6.8V\nNo backlight, the FET isn't opened (No power out on <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_FET</SIGNAL>)\nFan spins\nOrange Light on charger, battery or not\nNo Chime\nF7700 Backlight fuse was blown, replaced and its no longer blowing.\n\nIf anyone can help me, thanks a lot!"

However since there is no Chime its to be assumed the system does not boot or get past his early bootup stage.\nUSB Mouse doesn't light up either\n\n[QUOTE=\"aprendiz, post: 10202\"]Have you tried with another display assembly??[/QUOTE]\n\nNope, but the backlight pins on the display are 0V and the FET is not opening so the backlight is completely not being powered.\n\n[QUOTE=\"aprendiz, post: 10202\"]Fuse blown was for a reason, maybe bad cable or display....[/QUOTE]\n\nI assume the fuse was blown due the huge amount of whatever the person was drinking ended up on the motherboard, the backlight area looks the worst of all with some pins so rusty they barely would stick to the solder without extensive cleaning. Right now the backlight isn't even being enabled so the current going through the fuse is very minimal, but there is no short on the backlight lines which tells me the fuse would most likely not break.\n\nIt is possible that the display is permanently damaged due the short though, but that would still leave voltage on the backlight pins with the screen disconnected.\n\n\nThis all is if I'm correct though, feel free to let me know if I'm being stupid :p"
