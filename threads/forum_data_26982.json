I'm somewhat new to board level repairs on Mac, so I may not be the most knowledgeable on some things, but I have a particular board right now that is giving me issues. The computer itself turns on and runs, but it does shutdown at random times. I removed the board from the housing and tested it, however, without anything plugged in but the charger, the fan does not spin at all. I probed the board for the main power rails and did not get PP5V_S4. It was also missing various other S4 rails, and from testing U7501, the chip was not being told to turn on. I would think usually this would mean dead CPU, but the board still turns on? I have read through other posts on the forum, and it seems the 820-3662's have this problem, but I just wondered if I'm on the right track or if I'm missing something on this one? \n\nNOTE: Zero liquid damage on the board at all HOWEVER, a screw mount for one of the fans is completely ripped off the board and stuck to the fan. The customer took it to the Apple Store before they brought it to my store saying Apple said dead board. Would the screw mount have anything to do with this one?"}

But yeah I wish there was a solution for the problem like with the 2009 17\u201d but alas no dough to be made"}

Go get 2 ORIGINAL adapters at the Mac store, 85W magsafe 1 and a magsafe 2. No Ebay or Amazon garbage!"}

True story they are garbage."}
