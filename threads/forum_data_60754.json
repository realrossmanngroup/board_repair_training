        "message":"Hi,\n\nI have that board that I did purchase from eBay for a no internal display issue.\nThe board was not reworked, I can tell.\nThe only visual sign of damage that I've found was a slightly corroded Cap C7290.\nThe rest of the board is looking great.\n\nThe external display works fine and I can boot the system to macOS.\n\nI thought when purchasing that board that it would be another dead U9850 but I did replace that chip already 4 times, from purchased chip online and even with one from a board that had display prior to me taking the chip (working board but with bad SSD) so I can now confirm that's not the fix.\n\nThe SMC_LID signal is 3.3V\nI am getting 5V on PP5V_S0SW_LCD and 3V on PP3V3_S0SW_LCD so I am assuming that the LCD is told to turn on but no backlight.\nThough it's kind of impossible to tell if there is an image on those screens but I feel like there isn't.\n\nEDP_BKLT_EN is 0V and there is no short on that line.\nThe SCL\/SDA lines have activity.\n\nWhat else am I missing here potentially?\n\nEDIT: I can actually already confirm it's a no image as the screen is not detected even when plugged in and the signal goes directly to the external one.\nIn system profiler, there is only the mention of the externalone.\nI have tried 2 different known good displays with no difference."
