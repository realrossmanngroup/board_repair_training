        "A1706": "What is A1706? A1706 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3071, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00239, 820-00923..",
        "820-00923": "What is 820-00923? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "U3200": "What is U3200? a CHIP.",
        "U6903": "What is U6903? This chip is responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H in 2016-2018 model Macbook logic boards.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. ."
