Additionally, I programmed the U301 integrated circuit.\n\nCurrently, I'm getting a voltage reading of 20V 0.06A from all ports on the motherboard. When the battery is connected, it shows the voltage outwardly on a USB testing device. As I mentioned, the T2 is working because the device turns on and enters the system without any issues using the battery. Apart from that, C7865 has a voltage of 3.3V, and the input side of the FET at the battery charging port shows 12.2V. The situation is the same for all ports. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nThank you so much"}
