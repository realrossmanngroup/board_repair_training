Connected USB devices don't turn on.\n\nWithout Ram there is no beeping but the DVD-drive doesn't make noises anymore\n\nI know the first hinds will be \"look if there's anywhere else corrosion\" but I'm pretty sure I fixed all missing components and broken traces ( it was pain in da aaasss!)\n\nIs the  \u0336p\u0336\u0336c\u0336\u0336h\u0336   MCP faulty?"
