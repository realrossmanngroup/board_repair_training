No green light, no NOTHING!  I found that the credit card reader that has a power supply (walwart) was delivering 10V into the USB cord!!  Totally killed my boys computer.  I know I should start with the one wire right?  Figure out why it's not getting power. Check the battery. What about USB?  Just wondering where I should start knowing that it was killed because of voltage into the USB?\n\nThx."}
