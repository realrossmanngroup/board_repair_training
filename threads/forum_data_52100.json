        "message":"Hello, \n\nThis is the lovely GPU issue.  Everything is super clean no liquid no damage, I have done all the standard measurements and all is fine.  Here is a pic of the display and what it is doing. Just thought I would toss this out here to see if anyone has dealt with this exact issue.  Taking a break and will return to this soon, if anyone has some pointers on what to tackle next let me know.  would greatly appreciate any tips.  Oh and yes, I have cleaned up U8900.  \n\nThank you,\nMike"

I can get into OS, but its super hard with the screen like that.  I know I can also get into recovery.  The computer is like new, its a shame this board is likely bad.  \n\nThanks\nM"
