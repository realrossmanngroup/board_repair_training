Replaced any corroded/damaged components.\nWasn't getting <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> and no PP5vS4Rs3 so had to replace <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> \n\nNow fans spin up, green light & orange, but no full boot. No USB light up, CPU VCORE is at 1.72v and it doesn't get warm at all.\n\nAll power rails check out. <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> area is a little warm, but there was no liquid damage around there so I don't think it's necessarily the culprit? I'd like to not have to remove it unless it comes down to it. Any suggestions?"
