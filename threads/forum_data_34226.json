            "message": "This board came in with liquid damage around the ISL and TPS chips. After repairing the obvious liquid damage the computer got a green light, fan spin, and three beeps. I noticed this capacitor had exploded and part of it was up under the edge of another RAM module. My board view for 00138 seems to be a 3662 does anyone have any idea what the values of the little white capacitors just above the RAM under the CPU I have attached a picture of where the component used to be."
