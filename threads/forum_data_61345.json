Fixed all the traces for <CHIP>U5850</CHIP> but <CHIP>U4402</CHIP> seems impossible. pads 6 and 7 are torn off with only the nittle nub remaining. These both only go under <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>\n\nIs there any other way to try and fix besides soldering wire to little nub with <CHIP>U4402</CHIP> on top? Tried several times but fans continue to spin fast with SMC issue"
