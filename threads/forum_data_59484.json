I still have a short on 3.42\nI have .14v in between <RESISTOR>R5070</RESISTOR> Pin1 and Pin 2 <RESISTOR>R5000</RESISTOR> Where would be a good starting point\nGpu isn’t in short and cpu is measuring normal. Honestly I think it might be the gmux but I was avoiding that soo how difficult is it to replace gmux. I only have one gmux on a parts board ?  What would be the next move ?"
