I still have a short on 3.42\nI have .14v in between r5070 Pin1 and Pin 2 r5000 Where would be a good starting point\nGpu isn\u2019t in short and cpu is measuring normal. Honestly I think it might be the gmux but I was avoiding that soo how difficult is it to replace gmux. I only have one gmux on a parts board ?  What would be the next move ?"}

I guess my question is How difficult is it to change pch on this board ? Never removed one but I do have a bunch of different stencils So I\u2019ll just try to match it with one. How hard would you say is this task? I don\u2019t have a pre heater but I do have two hot air stations set for bottom and top heating. Thanks again for your help :)"}
