It didn't work when the customer tested it and now that I've got it back, is doesn't work either. The fan spins, but I get no chime...\n\nAll voltages are present (CPU voltage 1.75, don't these normally measure 1.8?);\nTested another BIOS; \nReplaced clock chip;\nJTAG removed;\nSMC replaced;\nSome touch up work. \n\nAny brilliant ideas?"
