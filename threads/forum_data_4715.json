This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present.

        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",

I'm not sure if I'm supposed to have 1.5v or 3.3v going into <TRANSISTOR>Q8151</TRANSISTOR>. When I have power running through the board there's no resistance from pin 2 to 6, and when there's no power there's no resistance from 1 to 6. But I still get no voltage coming out of 6, i.e. no <SIGNAL>DELAY_1V5S0_PGD</SIGNAL> and no <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>.\n\nThe other half of the MOSFET is an s0 rail, so I assume we don't need it to power it on initially.

            "message": "So the damage was mostly confined to the lower left area of the board (around the PCH and WIFI card connector) although the battery has a lot of corrosion on the board. I haven't used the battery at all. A bit of background, the board was originally worked on and \"cleaned\" but when I got it, it was still super dirty. I was told that at some point they got it to boot (after cleaning) but it got a kernel panic and shut off. Hasn't come back on.\n\nI've looked all over the board and anything that looks abnormal I've tested and they work. No red pads, no missing traces, no burnt components.\n\nGot a green then orange light on the charger, and after measuring I know I've got G3H and 3v42G3 coming in fine, both 3v and 5v S5 rails present everywhere. So since my s4 rails don't work, the schematic traces back to <CHIP>U8170</CHIP> for S4 Power Enable. Got power there too, but I have no <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL>.\n\nAt the PCH I don't have <SIGNAL>PCH_APWROK</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PCH_PWROK</SIGNAL>, or <SIGNAL>SYS_PWROK</SIGNAL> going in, and they all come out of <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>. So do I need <SIGNAL>SLP_S5</SIGNAL> from the SMC before I can get <CHIP>U1950</CHIP> to put out all the PWROK signals?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Did a bit of digging, someone had pretty much the same problem as me. Even after running a wire from <CAPACITOR>C8170</CAPACITOR> to <DIODE>D8174</DIODE>, I got my 5v S4 rail going, but still no ability to power. If I do an smc bypass the computer DOES boot, so I guess the board isn't shot completely. It'll boot halfway and then reboot. Could it be a current sensing issue?\n\n\nEDIT2: It's actually both s4 rails that work when i hotwire <SIGNAL>S4_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>, also <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS_FET</SIGNAL>, but I can't get any s3 rails because <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> isn't coming through. Read that it could be a clock issue, <SIGNAL>SYSCLK_CLK32K_RTC</SIGNAL> reads at 32khz. I'm going nuts here.\n\nI'm waiting for some donor boards, but I'm hoping I can find what the problem is before I gotta replace tons of components.\n\nEDIT3: So looks like the power sequencing goes <SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL> -> <SIGNAL>DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL> -> <SIGNAL>SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> -> <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> -> <SIGNAL>RSMRST_L</SIGNAL> -> <SIGNAL>SLP_S5</SIGNAL>. I know I'm good up to <SIGNAL>DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL>, so I'll be checking <SIGNAL>SLP_SUS</SIGNAL> tomorrow. What's weird is that even with S4 rails there's no power, and an SMC bypass yields only a partial boot. Could that mean PCH damage? Or SMC?"
