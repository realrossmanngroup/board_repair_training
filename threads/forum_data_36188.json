        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15‚Äù Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "GPUVCORE_EN": "What is GPUVCORE_EN? GPUVCORE_EN enables GPU VCORE when it is high, a power rail necessary for the GPU to function so you can get an image on the screen. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "U9100": "What is U9100? a CHIP.",
        "PPVCORE_GPU": "What is PPVCORE_GPU? This is the main power rail for the GPU. This is required for the GPU to turn on so you can get image on the display. .",
