        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

Same with known-good screen.\n\nI have ordered a new display flex (the short one screwed to logic board) to eliminate that as I do not have a known good to test with - beyond this is there anything else I should check?\n\nNo visible damage to J8500 or surrounding components\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nChris"

Something bizarre going on because I had a 0ohm short to ground there when I last looked the day it wouldnt turn on.\n\nSo bizarre because I literally had it in the OS on an external screen yesterday! \n\nWhat to investigate if its not turning 20v from charger on?"
