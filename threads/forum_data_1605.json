I tryed everythere but no chance to get new 216-0811000. but that is not my question. \n\nI wanted to know if it should pass the Display test in ASD 3S145A with the 216-0732025? And if yes, do you see a chance that it will pass after replacement with the same or with an 073219(thanks for that hint, I didnt knew until now.)"
