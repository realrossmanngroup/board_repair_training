            "message": "Hello. I got a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-02098</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that had physical damage to <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> by whoever previously attempted to worked on this. <SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground because of this. Also had a short on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> which ended up being caused by <CAPACITOR>C9222</CAPACITOR> exploding on the board. I replaced <CAPACITOR>C9222</CAPACITOR>, <CHIP>U8100</CHIP> and some caps around it, and both shorts were gone. When I connect the charger, I get only 5v up to 240ma for a second or two, and then it drops to 5v 50ma for a few seconds and then it starts that cycle again. All ports have the same symptoms. I put the board back in the case and connected the battery and it still stuck at 5v, but now the amps go up to 900ma and the board turns on and boots to the OS. Seems to run perfectly fine when the battery is connected, even without the charger. With the charger and battery connected, it does not charge or show that the charger is connected at all. I checked all current sense circuits for the ISL and they are fine. There is no liquid damage or any other noticeable signs of physical damage near the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s. Need some help.\n\n[B]With Charger only (5v, No boot)[/B]\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_AON</SIGNAL> - 12V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V8_AON</SIGNAL> - 3.799V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_AON</SIGNAL> - 3.298V\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_INT_L</SIGNAL> - 1.22V\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_AUX_DET</SIGNAL> - 1.28V\nCHGR_AUX_DET_3V3 - 0V\nCHRG_INT_1V8_L - 1.799V\n<SIGNAL>UPC_I2C_INT_L</SIGNAL> - 0V"

I was checking in diode mode on the debug connectors JG200 and JF200 and noticed different diode mode reading for some lines that were supposed to be the same. This lead me to finding broken traces on <SIGNAL>I2C_SMC_UPC_SCL</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>I2C_SMC_UPC_SDA</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>UPC_SMC_I2C_INT_L</SIGNAL>, so the three <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> chips on the left side were not connected to the M1 CPU or the other <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> on the other side. I ran 3 wires from J5101 to JF200 and now the board gives me 20v with just the charger on all 4 ports and charges the battery. Hopefully this may help someone else in the future."
