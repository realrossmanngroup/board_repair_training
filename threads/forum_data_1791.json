            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nfirst of all, thanks for taking a look at this. I've watched a lot of Louis's video's, but this is my first actual board I'm fixing. there was heavy liquid damage near the LCD connector, so i first replaced <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7920</TRANSISTOR> and <CAPACITOR>C9009</CAPACITOR>. The onewire circuit worked because i had/have a green light on the magsafe, but no fan spin. I diagnosed <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> not being present, so i replaced <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>. now I do have <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>, and my fan spins for a second before it stops, then starts again. that continues in a cycle. I also replaced <CAPACITOR>C6601</CAPACITOR> because I knocked the original off the board. Now the next signal that is not present is <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>. (I'm also missing <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL>) and the corresponding s0 rails but that seems logical to me since i dont have the S3 rails. \n\nThe part where I am stuck is this: \n\nfrom what I understand from the schematic, <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> creates <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>, but something has to happen with <TRANSISTOR>Q7260</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7261</TRANSISTOR>. Now what exactly that is, I don't know. I vaguely remember Louis has a video describing what an N channel mosfet is, I can't find the specific video anymore though. \n\nI do have 12.5v on pin 5 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7260</TRANSISTOR>. Some additional measurements: \nrail    should be   is    diode mode\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>    12.8    12.5    \n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL>    12.8    12.5    \n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL>            \n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>    3.42    3.47    \n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>    3    3.30    \n            \n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>    5    5.01    \n<SIGNAL>PP5V_SUS</SIGNAL>    5    5    \n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>    5    0    0.100\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>    5    0    \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>    3.3    3.3    \npp3v3s4    3.3    3.3    \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL>    3.3    0    \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>    3.3    0    \n            \n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL>    1.25    0    \n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_AXG</SIGNAL>    1.05    0    \n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S3_CPU_VCCDQ</SIGNAL>            \n\n\nCan anyone please point me in the right direction? Or knows what the video is where Louis explains the mosfets? Wikipedia and the likes only talk about substrates and chemical blablabla, which is all way above my college dropout mind. Thanks in advance!"
