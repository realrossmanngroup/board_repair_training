Seems like the internal resistance of the multimeter spun it up. \nI could feel the CPU was getting slightly warm, but no USB activity (only blinks ones) nor any screen. Also no more pulsing coils. \n\nVoltages on the big coils seem fine.\n\nU1950\nPin 7 - 0.26V\nPin 3 - 0.3 -0.18V discharging\n\nThen I decided to lift up U1950, and as I thought it had corroded pin 9 PPV3V42-G3H, which must be the reason for pulsing voltages as it doesn't get stable voltage. \n\n\nThanks for your assistance."}
