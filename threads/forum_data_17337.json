            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have a <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> MLB. When i reset the SMC the machine powers on & then after that it will power on every time as normal (By pressing power button on keyboard) with or without Charger. But when i let it sit for some time (1/2 Hour or so sometimes more/less) it will eventually not turn on again until i do an SMC reset, & then after it will turn on as normal again until i let it sit for some time.\n\nAll power rails seem to be present whether it is in a state where it won't turn on without SMC reset or when it will turn on as normal.\n\nThe board has no water damage of any kind & has never had any previous work done on it before.\n\nAny advice to point me in the right direction is much appreciated."
