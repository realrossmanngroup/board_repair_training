            "message": "Originally liquid damage around UB300. Did not power on originally. After ultrasonic the board came out clean. No charred components, or burnt pads/traces. After replacing the both UB300 and UB400 got everything back to working. Charges with normal USB-C cable. Behaves normally in the operating system. BUT this thing will not recognize any USB-C Hub. Apple or Otherwise. Will not charge through the USB-C Hub. (Confirmed known working hubs.) DC-In stays at 5V through the hub. I am not really sure what could be effecting the this since regular charging is working. Any ideas?"
