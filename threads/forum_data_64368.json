When I connect the power supply, it turns on, runs the cooler for about 7 seconds and restarts.\n\nDuring testing, it turned on normally. I assembled it all and when the system started, it froze and the screen was all streaked, it didn't turn on again.\n\nI tried SMC bypass, clean BIOS file, changed the BIOS chip, without success.\n\nWhen turned on, I have all the voltages on the S0 line. PLT_RESET 3.3. I removed the Q8150 to test, it didn't work either."}
