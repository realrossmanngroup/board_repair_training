Update- the board will power on but i get nothing on the screen now, but i see the screen gets a faint glow to it.  i have tested on multiple working screens and one screen put lines down it.  so i know its the board.  all my hdmi to thunderbolt seem broke recently and i have one on the way so will test it to see if im getting external display soon.  also i looked over the board the best i could to see if i could find anything obvious but nothing yet."

I already have another 2011 thats going in for gpu replacement so i will just take this one in with that one and hope that its just the gpu.  $50 risk for a $500 board seems okay to me haha. i will update after i take it in. \nThanks duke!"
