SMBUS_SMC_0_S0_SCL is a clock line on the data line between the system management controller(SMC), temperature sensors, GPU, and ALS(ambient light sensor). If this line is pulled down the machine may run slow or have the fans run fast all the time because the SMC can’t tell what the temperature of parts of the machine like fin stack are. Usual problem is bad webcam, unplug webcam to see if it fixes problem. .",
