        "820-3332": "What is 820-3332? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP3V3_S3": "What is PP3V3_S3? a SIGNAL.",

            "message": "This board had no liquid damage and no other visible damage. So it was starting off with intermittent blackscreens, which I thought I traced to the dedicated graphics not getting power on gpuvcore as it seemed to black out when it was switching, and now when I try and plug it in, I get the orange light, but the fan will rarely spin, and I hear clicking noises coming from the circuitry, and yes it does seem to be the electronics, because it will click even with the fan unplugged. I thought this might be a coil or mosfet as I have heard of them making strange noises like clicking, but I'm a bit lost here, especially since it will turn on randomly after plugging it in many times.\n\nEdit: and I am using an 85W charger"
