I replaced with leaded still. All else looks great, no liquid, only some thermal paste residue. \nTesting showed 8 related failed sensors - GPU proximity, GPU Die, Left/Right Fin stack. visually, <CHIP>U5550</CHIP> area looked good. Tested against a good board - solid 3.3v in, resistors are good but pins 2,3,4,5 are bouncing around from .3v-.9v. Replaced <CAPACITOR>C5551</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C5552</CAPACITOR> with no change. Swapped <CHIP>U5550</CHIP> (from <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) and the issue appeared to be gone, pins 2-5 were all at consistent voltages. \nInstalled and tested, fans still high and sensors failed again. PRAM reset x3 and SMC reset. Ran fine and passed the tests. \nLet sit overnight without power and this morning the issue is back. Resets will not solve. <CHIP>U5550</CHIP> still testing good. \nPics included. (MUX switching failure due to testing without display)."

No change immediately, but after looking over the board and verifying traces between <TRANSISTOR>Q5501</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q5503</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U5550</CHIP> the voltages on <CHIP>U5550</CHIP> have leveled out and the board runs fine. \nI don't think i'm solving the issue here. Not sure how these symptoms can come and go unless theres some trace/connection somewhere thats hit or miss.. Will run through the cleaner and see what happens. \n\nOnly found one other similar topic: [url]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/21549-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3332</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-th1h-sensor-error[/url]"
