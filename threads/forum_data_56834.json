        "820-2915": "What is 820-2915? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "CHGR_BMON": "What is CHGR_BMON? CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",

        "R7050": "What is R7050? Current sense shunt resistor for the battery, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 17/18 on ISL6259 should give you 2.02 ohms. .",

            "message": "MacBook came in with a swollen battery a few months ago and not holding a charge. Replaced battery and sent customer on their way. Customer comes back a 2 months later with the replacement battery no longer holding a charge and only had 1 cycle count. Considered it a defective battery and replaced under warranty. Customer comes back in again with the same issue of the battery not holding a charge, stuck a 1 cycle count.\n\nRan coconut battery and discovered that the MacBook was charging that battery at 0.1 Watt. Discharging with 6.8 Watts\n\nOn <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>\n<SIGNAL>PP5V1_CHGR_VDD</SIGNAL>= 5V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V1_CHGR_VDDP</SIGNAL>= 4.9V\nResistant between pin 27/28 : 20.5 ohms\nResistance between pin 17/18 : 2.8 ohms\n\nI replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR>.\n\nMacBook now begins to charge at 15 Watts, but then drops to charging at 6.8 Watts\n\nMeasured\n<RESISTOR>R7050</RESISTOR> : 0.3 ohms\n<RESISTOR>R5441</RESISTOR> on <SIGNAL>SMC_DCIN_ISENSE</SIGNAL> : 4.5k ohms\n<RESISTOR>R5420</RESISTOR> on <SIGNAL>CHGR_BMON</SIGNAL> : 0 ohms\n<RESISTOR>R5422</RESISTOR> on <SIGNAL>SMC_BMON_ISENSE</SIGNAL> : 45.3k ohms\nThese reported normally.\n\nReplaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7055</TRANSISTOR> again to rule out defective mosfet. No change.\n\nI then measured around <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR>\n<RESISTOR>R7085</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7086</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7080</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R7081</RESISTOR> were all reporting the same measurements when compared to a working board.\n\nI replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7080</TRANSISTOR>.\n\nMacBook is still charging at 6.8 Watts.\n\nJust to make sure that the SMC was not screwing with the charging, I replaced SMC from a working donor.\n\nStill charging at 6.8 Watts.\n\nWhat I have determined is that something is limiting the charging current to the battery because the board will begin to take 15 Watts but then drop to 6.8 Watts. I installed another battery just to make sure that I don't have a defective battery only to have to same results.\n\nI know it is in my face, but what else is responsible for battery current sensing?"
