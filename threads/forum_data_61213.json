Had to replace both and the board turned on but no video. Get chime sound but no display, neither internal nor external. After inspection I found some bad resistors around <CHIP>U9300</CHIP> area. Replaced <RESISTOR>R9300</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R9301</RESISTOR>, also <CHIP>U9300</CHIP> just in case. Same result. Start measuring signals and found that <CHIP>U9300</CHIP> gets power but gets no EN signal on pin 38. Now I'm stuck and don't know exactly what to do. Suspecting bad <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> since it's the chip that generates that signal."
