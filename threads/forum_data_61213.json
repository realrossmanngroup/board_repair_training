Got this board here that initially was not powering on. Turned out to be bad PPBUS_G3H MOSFETS. Had to replace both and the board turned on but no video. Get chime sound but no display, neither internal nor external. After inspection I found some bad resistors around U9300 area. Replaced R9300 and R9301, also U9300 just in case. Same result. Start measuring signals and found that U9300 gets power but gets no EN signal on pin 38. Now I'm stuck and don't know exactly what to do. Suspecting bad U9600 since it's the chip that generates that signal."}
