        "message":"Hi Louis, Duke, and group,\n\nYesterday I received a Macbook Air - 820-3437.  Only closely looking at the logic board I do not see any liquid damage to the board.  When I plug in the charger I can see the light comes one with Green and then turns amber.  The fan as usual spins, stops, spins, stops and then continues to spin.  Can you advice me where to look for in order to troubleshoot the board.  I was watching a video of Louis, where it mentions about the backlight.  My understanding is that when it is a backlight problem, we can see the Apple logo but DARK, Am I correct ?  If it is not the backlight then please advice further steps to troubleshoot this board.  Thanks in Advance.  Raj."
