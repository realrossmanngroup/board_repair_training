So, no doubt I'll have another go but definately once I have gone over the blackbox style power system architectiure page on the schematic and look at the blocks in detail on the schematic.\n\nYou think it would serve to read up on sandy, ivy and haswell and the various series chipsets (QM77, etc) a bit too?.\n\nGood encouragement guys thank you"
