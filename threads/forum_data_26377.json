I cleaned it up in the ultrasonic and now I get a green/orange light on the charger but it doesn't boot and the fan doesn't spin. Going through the power rails It seems that I have no <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> or <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>  at <CAPACITOR>C4807</CAPACITOR> is 2.37v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> at L4807 pin 2 is 2.37v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> at L4011 pin 2 is 0v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> at J6050 pin 1 is 0v\n\nI replaced <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> because it looked pretty crappy. I've checked around the chip for short to ground and all check out with resistance.  Any ideas of what to look for next? Thanks!"
