        "message":"Hi everybody\n\nI have 820-2850 board, its have PPBUS_G3H 2V. When i checked voltage CHGR_UGATE is 2V so Q7030 cant create PPBUS_G3H. ( When i inject 12.8 V PPBUS_G3H line machine is working )\n\nReplaced 3 times U7000 ,q7030,q7035 ( same time replaced) . I cant find ISL6259AHRTZ datasheet for understand how is CHGR_UGATE creating, any idea about problem.\n\nThanks."
