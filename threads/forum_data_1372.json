        "820-2850": "What is 820-2850? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CHGR_UGATE": "What is CHGR_UGATE? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "Q7030": "What is Q7030? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "Q7035": "What is Q7035? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",
        "CHGR_RTS_L": "What is CHGR_RTS_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "CHGR_RST_L": "What is CHGR_RST_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging.."

When i checked voltage <SIGNAL>CHGR_UGATE</SIGNAL> is 2V so <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> cant create <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. ( When i inject 12.8 V <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> line machine is working )\n\nReplaced 3 times <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> ,<TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>,<TRANSISTOR>Q7035</TRANSISTOR> ( same time replaced) . I cant find ISL6259AHRTZ datasheet for understand how is <SIGNAL>CHGR_UGATE</SIGNAL> creating, any idea about problem.\n\nThanks."
