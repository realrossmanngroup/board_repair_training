I'm working on a 820-2879 with a spinning fan, no video, no chime\/post.  \n\nThere are 5 pads between u6990 and u7600 that are very slightly red, other than that I can find no evidence of any water damage.  I checked a few voltages related to the CPU in case that was the issue and found;\n\nPPCPUVTT_S0_REG at 1.074v\nSPI_ROM on pin 8 has 3.315\nPVCORE_S0_CPU_REG = 1.103v\n\nAny idea on where to look next?  Researching the 5 flashes of the sleep light I found there could be a ROM issue, which seems to all relate to this area of the board.  Any thoughts on where to go next or what to test?\n\nthanks,\nPaul"}
