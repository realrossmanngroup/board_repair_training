            "message": "Greetings.  I'm working on a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2879</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with a spinning fan, no video, no chime/post.  \n\nThere are 5 pads between <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> that are very slightly red, other than that I can find no evidence of any water damage.  I checked a few voltages related to the CPU in case that was the issue and found;\n\n<SIGNAL>PPCPUVTT_S0_REG</SIGNAL> at 1.074v\n<SIGNAL>SPI_ROM</SIGNAL> on pin 8 has 3.315\n<SIGNAL>PVCORE_S0_CPU_REG</SIGNAL> = 1.103v\n\nAny idea on where to look next?  Researching the 5 flashes of the sleep light I found there could be a ROM issue, which seems to all relate to this area of the board.  Any thoughts on where to go next or what to test?\n\nthanks,\nPaul"
