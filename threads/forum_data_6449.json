I can get a flash drive to detect in the \" front and back\" ports but larger devices like external hdd or usb mouse do not work in the ports. I have 5v on both ports. No change in voltage when a device is plugged in.  Keyboard/touchpad/ everything thing else on the usb hub seem to be working fine. Seems like higher amperage devices are not being powered. Please advise. Thanks."
