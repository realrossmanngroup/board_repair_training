Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics."

            "message": "I'm working on a Mid 2010 MBP 15\" 2.66 i7 with the NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M that randomly reboots throughout the day.  The crash report has the ominous \"GPU Panic\" as one of the first lines.  \nI can't seem to remember where I saw it but I'm pretty sure there was an older post about how reballing was rarely the issue and replacing a cap in many cases could solve this issue.  Can you possibly point me in the right direction so I can identify the cap, test, replace, etc.... \n\nOr.... since this customer doesn't do much more than light MS Word and general web surfing is it possible to force the system to never use the NVIDIA GPU and only use the basic Intel one ?\n\nAny help in the right direction would be most appreciated."
