The crash report has the ominous \"GPU Panic\" as one of the first lines.  \nI can't seem to remember where I saw it but I'm pretty sure there was an older post about how reballing was rarely the issue and replacing a cap in many cases could solve this issue.  Can you possibly point me in the right direction so I can identify the cap, test, replace, etc.... \n\nOr.... since this customer doesn't do much more than light MS Word and general web surfing is it possible to force the system to never use the NVIDIA GPU and only use the basic Intel one ?\n\nAny help in the right direction would be most appreciated."}
