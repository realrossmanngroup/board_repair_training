This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  ."

(fan spins, green light goes orange, and i get a blinking battery symbol)\n\nwhen i remove black flat io board cable and no battery it boots into OS\n\nif i replace io board, io board cable with 100% working good on other logic board same result so io board and io board cable is not the issue.\n\ni replaced connector on the logic board (the one for the black flat cable) no change"
