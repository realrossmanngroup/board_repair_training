        "820-2850": "What is 820-2850? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U9600": "What is U9600? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

        "A1278": "What is A1278? A1278 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook or Macbook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2254, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2327, 820-2530, 820-2879, 820-2936, 820-3115..",
        "A1465": "What is A1465? A1465 is a model number for a 11 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2924, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00164, 820-3208, 820-3435..",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "LVDS_DDC_CLK": "What is LVDS_DDC_CLK? LVDS_DDC_CLK Is the DDC clock line between the graphics processor and the screen. DDC is a protocol for identifying a screen so that you know what resolution/refresh rate it wants. This is necessary for screen detection, inductor on this data line must be good and DDC voltage must be going to the LCD screen for it to work. .",
        "LVDS_DDC_DATA": "What is LVDS_DDC_DATA? LVDS_DDC_DATA Is the DDC data line between the graphics processor and the screen. DDC is a protocol for identifying a screen so that you know what resolution/refresh rate it wants.

Backlight also doesn't work.\n\nThere was liquid damage on the LCD connector, replaced connector, but still no image. Currently don't have a mini-displayport convertor, so can't check image externally.\nDevice seems to boot, since I hear the chimes and <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is present.\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> = 3.4V\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> = 1.38V\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> is not present (no short), <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> is also not present. Traced this down to <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> which is not present. Since <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> comes from <CHIP>U9600</CHIP>, I've reach a dead end here.\n\nSo it's not being told to turn on the LCD/backlight, while it is booted and the lid is open. Since I have limited experience with macbook repairs, I'm kind of at a dead end here. Where to look for next?"

I have a donor <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> and <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1465</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> with known good LCD assemblies for example. Any easy way to check compatibility?\n\nVisually the traces coming from J9000 seem fine. I measured those on the same side of the board, and seem fine.\n\nVoltages:\nPin 4 (<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>) = 3.27V\nPin 6 (<SIGNAL>LVDS_DDC_CLK</SIGNAL>) = 3.26V\nPin 7 (<SIGNAL>LVDS_DDC_DATA</SIGNAL>) = 3.26V\n\nVoltages are the same with and without the LCD connected.\n\n<RESISTOR>R9010</RESISTOR>/11 are 65k-75k in circuit, so seem fine. L9000/10/11 also seem fine. Coils in L9010/11 are 1.5/2 ohm each, L9000 is 0.5 ohms.\n\nI used the connector to replace from a donor board. Even tho it seems ok even with 40x magnification under the microscope, I've ordered some new connectors just to be 100% sure.\n\nBut even without a LCD connected I should be getting (a relatively high) voltage on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>, right? Or should there be a connection with the LCD before <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> turns it's <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> output on?"
