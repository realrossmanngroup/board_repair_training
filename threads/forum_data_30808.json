        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",
        "R5280": "What is R5280? Pullup resistor between PP3V42_G3H and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA which is a data line that allows the SMC to communicate with the battery and the battery charging chip. This line is necessary for the battery to be recognized. With red probe on ground, diode mode should measure 0.441 on pin 2 of this resistor. .",

            "message": "Hi guys, i got a Macbook 2936 that was worked on before, covered in flux. The mac works fine from Charger, green light burning, but when the battery is connected it doesnt start when i connect the charger and no light. I can turn it on shorting <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>.  All voltages present when from AC, when battery is connected ACIN drops from 3.9 with Charger to 2.5 with battery connected, assuming it should still be 3.9v here. All resistors are OK (<RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR>/22, <RESISTOR>R7010</RESISTOR>/11, <RESISTOR>R7051</RESISTOR>/52, <RESISTOR>R5280</RESISTOR>/5281) and no short on any of the pins of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> just because I can, but the same. Also <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> had a weird looking IC on it so replaced that, still the same. Using original charger.\n\nAny ideas how to tackle this?\n\nGreetz\nArno"
