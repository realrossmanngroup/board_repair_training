        "message":"Hi guys, i got a Macbook 2936 that was worked on before, covered in flux. The mac works fine from Charger, green light burning, but when the battery is connected it doesnt start when i connect the charger and no light. I can turn it on shorting SMC_ONOFF_L.  All voltages present when from AC, when battery is connected ACIN drops from 3.9 with Charger to 2.5 with battery connected, assuming it should still be 3.9v here. All resistors are OK (R7021\/22, R7010\/11, R7051\/52, R5280\/5281) and no short on any of the pins of U7000. Replaced U7000 just because I can, but the same. Also Q7030 had a weird looking IC on it so replaced that, still the same. Using original charger.\n\nAny ideas how to tackle this?\n\nGreetz\nArno"
