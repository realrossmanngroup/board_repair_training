        "message":"Hi I got an  820-01958. PPBUS_G3H is 12.6v, PP5V_G3S is 5v, PP3V3_G3H is 3.3v. PVDDCPUAWAKE_SW0 to SW3 are 0.75v, PP0V82_SLPDDR is 0.82v, PP1V8_SLPS2R is 1.8v, , PP1V1_SLPS2R is 1.1v, PP0V9_SLPDDR is 0.9v, PPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0 is 1.8v. PP1V05_PCH_EXT_REG, PPVNN_PCH_EXT_REG, and PPVCC_CPU_PH1 to PH3 are all present when the unit is undergoing a DFU. DFU fails with either 4010, or 4017. We've noticed that Y8001 reads 33-34Khz and increases to 42Khz during a DFU.\n\nI also tried looking for dump of  U4770 but am unable to find one. Any input appreciated."
