        "820-00239": "What is 820-00239? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "U7800": "What is U7800? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PM_SLP_SUS_L": "What is PM_SLP_SUS_L? \nThe \"PM_SLP_SUS_L\" signal in a MacBook is related to the power management of the device, specifically concerning the 'suspend to RAM' state or S3 state. It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",
        "PM_SYSRST_L": "What is PM_SYSRST_L? PM_SYSRST_L is a system reset signal present when it is low, _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be high for the system to exit reset mode & turn on properly. .",
        "PP3V3_PMICLDO": "What is PP3V3_PMICLDO? a SIGNAL."

She lost all her data. So I assume mainboard was replaced.\n\nUnder the microscope, the mainboard perfectly fine. Only I could notice some solder balls next to <DIODE>D3302</DIODE>.\nRails presents are all the S5 rails, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>.\n\nWe are getting <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> but not <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>.\nHowever <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> is bumping...\n\nFollowing this, we've found out that <SIGNAL>PM_SYSRST_L</SIGNAL> was also bumping...\n\nThe only chip which seems overheating is the PMIC <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>.\n\nAny idea what we could check next please?"
