She lost all her data. So I assume mainboard was replaced.\n\nUnder the microscope, the mainboard perfectly fine. Only I could notice some solder balls next to D3302.\nRails presents are all the S5 rails, PPBUS_G3H and PP3V3_G3H.\n\nWe are getting PM_SLP_S5_L but not PM_SLP_S4_L.\nHowever PM_SLP_SUS_L is bumping...\n\nFollowing this, we've found out that PM_SYSRST_L was also bumping...\n\nThe only chip which seems overheating is the PMIC U7800.\n\nAny idea what we could check next please?"}

I might have missed it though, can't be sure...\n\nThanks for your help anyway."}
