When plugging the board into another MacBook it is instantly recognized as being in DFU mode every time it is connected. I have tried reviving and restoring multiple times and it always fails giving 1 of 2 error messages shown in the attached photos. Not sure how to proceed on this one.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: 12.35v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_G3S</SIGNAL>: 0v (looks to be told to enable by T2 which isn't sending out that signal for some reason)\n<SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL>: 0v (read other posts that you need this for DFU but the others have said they had a successful DFU and it restored this rail so I don't know.)\n\nThese T2 models are pretty annoying and seem to have many issues, unfortunately.\n\nThanks for any help you guys can provide!"
