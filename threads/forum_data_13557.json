Obviously looking for visual ques of where to begin. Sometimes that is not a luxury I have so I begin with power rails.  My question is elementary, and I know I shouldnt be doing what I do if I don't already know this, but how do you determine where a power rail starts? Schematics aren't necessarily in order of flow, and I think it pertinent to test certain rails from their source.  Go easy on me :-)"}
