Getting AHT error macbook 4sns/1/40000001:tn1d--1.000.  My best research shows is it's a cpu heat sensor.  I checked around <CHIP>U5515</CHIP> and also <TRANSISTOR>Q5501</TRANSISTOR> but no damage anywhere.  I was going to change these out but wanted to make sure I'm in the ballpark before I turn on the heat.\n\nthanks,\nPaul"

Unless there is corrosion somewhere of course.\n\nIs the piece of tape present on the airport connector, this will also cause lock ups. Remove the metal sponge from the cable."
