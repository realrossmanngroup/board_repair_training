Works when connected to an external.\n\nI have cleaned the board off and can see no damage to traces/components. The backlight IC looks clean.\n\nAttached are some pre-clean photos for reference.\n\nIt would be great to know what I should look for to determine what is preventing the LCD from enabling.\n\nThanks!"
