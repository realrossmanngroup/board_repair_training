Removed F7140, short still there removed q5500, short still there. Injected 8.5v into the line, and something is pulling more than 5A. Using freeze spray, C7543 gets hot straight away and nothing else. Haven't removed it yet, but this component isn't even on the voltage line I have injected voltage into, so how can that be?\nThanks\nTo add to that, I have found a short on the voltage line for C7620 which. That cap and C7543 are on S5 voltage lines.\n\nAnd adding again, I have found shorts on:\nppbus_s5_hs_computing_isns\nppbus_s5_hs_other_isns\nLooking at the schematic these look to be fed by ppbus_g3h, so if one of them has a short, then I am guessing all if them will have a short?\nThanks again"}

Why start with anything lower than the actual voltage for the voltage line. Found the problems anyway. Replaced all components mentioned and the battery, switching on like usual now."}
