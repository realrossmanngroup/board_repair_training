            "message": "MacBook Air 820 3437 board, charges as it shows green light then red light, no fan spin.\nFound short on pin 2 of F7140 and the component itself is burnt out anyway. Removed F7140, short still there removed <TRANSISTOR>Q5500</TRANSISTOR>, short still there. Injected 8.5v into the line, and something is pulling more than 5A. Using freeze spray, <CAPACITOR>C7543</CAPACITOR> gets hot straight away and nothing else. Haven't removed it yet, but this component isn't even on the voltage line I have injected voltage into, so how can that be?\nThanks\nTo add to that, I have found a short on the voltage line for <CAPACITOR>C7620</CAPACITOR> which. That cap and <CAPACITOR>C7543</CAPACITOR> are on S5 voltage lines.\n\nAnd adding again, I have found shorts on:\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL>\nLooking at the schematic these look to be fed by <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>, so if one of them has a short, then I am guessing all if them will have a short?\nThanks again"
