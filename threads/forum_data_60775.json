Machine Boots up in SMC Bypass Mode but does not see any battery? <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 13.02V  With Battery Connected while running in SMC Bypass mode and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.58V while machine is off and charger plugged in with battery connected. An original 87w Charger is being used and battery is Good. I tried the machine with a different <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00928</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> Board and Machine starts right up without Problems. All 4 <SIGNAL>USB_CHIPS</SIGNAL> are good and getting 20V on the AmpMeter...No Liquid Damage anywhere on Board. Iâ€™m also getting the following measurements...\n<SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL>. 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> 3.1V\n<SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL>  3.29V while Running  and 0V before boot up\n<SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL>  3.19v\n\nAny Suggestion where to start looking? ANY help would be Greatly Appreciated...Thank You"
