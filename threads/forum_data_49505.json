        "820-00138": "What is 820-00138? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR": "What is PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR? PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR is PPBUS_G3H after it has passed through a backlight fuse and a transistor that allows power through when BKLT_PLT_RST_L and LCD_BKLT_EN are present. .",
        "PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW": "What is PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW? PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW is a line after the inductor in the DC to DC boost circuit for backlight that connects to the LED driver’s switch(SW) pin where it is switched to ground rapidly in order to create the boosted voltage for the backlight circuit. .",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "D7701": "What is D7701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "I2C_BKLT_SDA": "What is I2C_BKLT_SDA? I2C_BKLT_SDA is a data line between the LCD screen and the LED driver. This data line cannot short to ground. If it does, the screen cannot talk to the LED driver, and the LED driver will not allow the circuit to produce a backlight..",
        "LCD_BKLT_PWM_R": "What is LCD_BKLT_PWM_R? a SIGNAL."

Its a difficult one as no boardview for it, so a nightmare to try and work out what is what. I have made the following diode readings, but don't have another board to compare it to so not overly sure what is correct and what isnt. I can see there are a couple of OL's in there. Im not sure if they should be or not, as the boardview that is marked as the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00138</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A doesnt actually resemble the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00138</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A .\n\nv noticed pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> is OL, its <SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL> . I have tried it pos to ground and neg to ground in diode mode, and both show OL. Not sure if this is correct or not ?\n\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> at the connector is 0.00 at the fuse its 12.55\n\nIf I check continuity between the connector pin and the diode / caps its showing as 000.3 so it appears to be connected ok to the connector.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR</SIGNAL> @ <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> = 12.55v\n<SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL> @ <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> = 12.44v\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> @ connector = 0.00v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW</SIGNAL> = 0.15v\n <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN_R</SIGNAL> = 3.3v"
