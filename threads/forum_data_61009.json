        "A1425": "What is A1425? A1425 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Early 2013, Late 2012 with EMC 2672, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3190, 820-3462..",
        "820-3462": "What is 820-3462? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "U9701": "What is U9701? a CHIP.",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",

Things i replace LCD connector /<CHIP>U9701</CHIP> tried two different screens / replace resistors around <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> check diode mode all good reading and even replace <RESISTOR>R7402</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7403</RESISTOR> from <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>  and over kill still all the same even did pram reset  and smc lid is working any help is needed maybe i miss some thing or i may have left out something i did and forgot to write it on this post  thanks."
