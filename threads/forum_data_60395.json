            "message": "I have this <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1465</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, it works perfectly, battery charges, runs great on battery power, reboots just fine. No signs of liquid and the Mac is in mint condition.\n\nTrouble is when you turn the computer off, it won't turn on again with the power button. When the charger is connected it charges the battery but the macbook doesn't turn on (sometimes if the battery is very low it does turn on). You have to disconnect the battery, plug in the charger, it turns on by itself, connect the battery again and it runs great until you turn it off again.\n\n\nI've tried another battery, the Mac behaves the same.\nI've measured <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> when battery connected and power button pressed: 0.42V.  (If not pressed 3.42V as usual).\n\nI've measured voltage on F7140: \n7.40V battery only\nSlowly goes from 7.40 to 8.6V battery + charger connected\n8.59V only charger\n\nWhat i also tried is with the battery disconnected, connect the charger, it turns on, i turn it off from the OS without disconnecting the charger, and it doesn't turn on again with the power button. <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> goes to 0.40V but it doesn't turn on. Tried shorting the pad to ground but same result.\n\nSMC bypass does not work either. \n\nCan it be a bad SMC? Bad keyboard (is the only i have unfortunatelly)?\n\nAny help is much appreciated. Thanks!"
