            "message": "Got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2850</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> in today - no light on the charger initially - checked board see the <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> has been replaced before so decided to resolder it - after resoldering i'm getting a green light after 15-20 seconds (not instant) and it doesn't go orange. Board starts and says battery is 0% and not charging - same behaviour with a new battery but when I turned the machine off the light went orange and it appeared to be charging for a bit - then I start hearing a whining noise coming from the board until the light went green again and the noise stopped - battery had charged up to about 1%.\n\nMy thoughts are leaning to bad ISL at this point - no obvious signs of corrosion, missing resistors of broken traces that I can see from my visual inspection but wanted to check if the behaviour described is consistent with a bad ISL chip?\n\nShould probably add that for the first 15-20 seconds i'm getting 12.3v on PPBUS which jumps up to 12.6 after the light comes on."
