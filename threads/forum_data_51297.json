I have PP3V3_G3H. I've looked at everything I can find in the area. The spill wan't too bad, just hit this area a little. R3351 was blown. I replaced that and Q3350 to be safe. R3209 had a charred pad so I cleaned that off and replaced R3209. Not sure where to go next. Is it just replace the CD3215 chips?"}

If I replace them can I pull them off any of the MacBook Pros with C00's on them? Also, can I just order and use the C00's from Louis or do I need to program those first? I'll check the other things you mentioned once I'm near the board again."}

Pads were charred underneath it. Has 20V and CPU now after cleaning up the pads and replacing U8510. My CD3215's were probably fine the whole time. Thanks so much for getting me there. I really wanted to fix this board so I could test the stack of SSD's I have from all of these 00840 boards that had shorted CPU's"}
