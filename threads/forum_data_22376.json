Restored <SIGNAL>P1V8_S0</SIGNAL> Got fan to spin, and computer to start up. Only problem now is that the light on the charger stays green despite a dead battery, and still shows possible charging. When I disconnect the charger, the screen goes dark, but the fan keeps spinning... anyone have any suggestions?"
