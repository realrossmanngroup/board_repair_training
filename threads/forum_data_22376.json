History of liquid damage near DCIN Connector. Also shorted U7720. Board was \"dead\" though running... No fan. Restored P1V8_S0 Got fan to spin, and computer to start up. Only problem now is that the light on the charger stays green despite a dead battery, and still shows possible charging. When I disconnect the charger, the screen goes dark, but the fan keeps spinning... anyone have any suggestions?"}
