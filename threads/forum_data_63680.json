Best if the measurements are done  with R9083 out of circuit, but I'll take what can get.\n\nThank you"}

Just to clarify what i am trying to achieve since i did not actually mention it. \n\nI do not have a failed one here to measure, but i am trying to get the resistance values of one that has failed in the common way these are now failing. That is the 2.5v supply on L9081 becomes 7.4v and burns out the NAND chips.     What i am trying to do is determine what part of that circuit is failing to cause this.   I have a strong feeling one of those resistors is the common fault and would like to replace them with higher wattage resistors to prevent the failure on my personal machine.  \n\nThat is all to say, i am aware what the values are meant to be, and with the circuit in perfect working order i have confirmed that the measured values line up closely to the schematic values, but i would like to know if those values change in the event of the common failure.  \n\nBasically trying to do failure analysis, without having a failure to analyze."}
