Fixed it replacing <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R7006</RESISTOR>. \n\nNow when plug magsafe it going orange -> green - > orange -> just like something is reseting smc constantly. Checked SMC _RESET_L and it has 3.4 V droping to 3V when charger light goes green. \n\nThere was corrosion near J6100 and i removed it completely. \n\nAny suggestion?"
