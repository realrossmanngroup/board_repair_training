        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL? This is the voltage coming directly from the charger after going through a transistor. .",
        "R7012": "What is R7012? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7010": "What is R7010? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7011": "What is R7011? a RESISTOR.",
        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",
        "D7012": "What is D7012? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year model macbook airs, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. ."
