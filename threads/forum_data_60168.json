        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",

            "message": "Hi,\nI'm stuggling with this board.\nI got the board from a laptop which had obviously been taken apart previously.\nAt first, I only got 5V on the charger, so I replaced one of the CD3215s (the one that got hot) and then I got 20V and the board was booting fine.\nExcept there was no backlight.\nChecking the backlight regulator area, I found 2 resistors (<RESISTOR>R8445</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R8442</RESISTOR>) that had been ripped off the board. Probably by the previous guy who wasn't careful enough when manipulating the board. One of them is responsible for feeding <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> to the chip, and the other one gives the <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> signal to the chip, so I thought it would be logical to have no backlight and it should be an easy fix.\nBut after putting back those two resistors, still no backlight.\nThe fuse is not blown, as usual.\nI have 13 volts at the input of the PMOS (<TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR>) but nothing out of it.\nIts gate measures about 12 volts, which explains why it's not turning on.\nThere is no short to PPBUS on the gate. Both resistors of the voltage divider are measuring good.\nI can see the <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN_R</SIGNAL> signal to the chip going from 0V to 3.3V a few seconds after I plug the charger in.\nBut the chip never ties <SIGNAL>BKLT_SD</SIGNAL> to ground, therefore not activating the voltage divider.\nI do have keyboard backlight.\n<SIGNAL>LID_OPEN</SIGNAL> is high.\nI have tried to replace <CHIP>U8400</CHIP>, but still the same issue."

            "message": "Yeah, good spot. One of the two 0 Ohms resistors for the I2C bus to <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> was damaged. Nothing visible at first, but in fact one of the metallic ends was detached from the rest of the resistor.\nWhen I probed it, since I was pushing on both ends with the probes, it actually made contact and gave me a good reading, but without the probe pushing on it, it was an open circuit.\nI didn't realize that the I2C bus was necessary for the backlight to turn on. I thought that it was only used to adjust brightness. Lesson learned.\nI knew it was not a flexgate because I tried on two different screens, including one which I knew was working fine.\nAnyway, the board now gives me a backlight and an image.\nI'm not done with it though. Although it boots and runs, it looks like thunderbolt doesn't work. My USB-C to HDMI port doesn't want to work on any of the two ports. System Information tells me I have no Thunderbolt hardware, also. Hopefully the last problem on that board, and hopefully fixable."
