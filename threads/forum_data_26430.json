But when i'm replacing the smc it has to be from a same model board (of course considering is the same chip)?"}

China sometimes has these but they've become more rare for some\nYou can still find them for a couple of boards though, check aliexpress\n\nI don't think there is a way to export full SMC firmware and flash them onto a new blank chip. But if anyone knows something about it its probably duke"}

As long as is the same chip and it has apple programming on it it will work. Not board model dependant. And you're right, those chips have a protect bit that erases itself when you try to read with a programmer. F*ck Apple! Thanks for the input!"}
