Board is very clean. All TP's are still gold. No visible burnt traces or damage except for what I already specified.\nWill check for shorts. When you say check all rails, do you mean main power rails and sub rails? (Everything on pg 68) Or just main power rails? Diode or resistance mode?\n\nThanks."}
