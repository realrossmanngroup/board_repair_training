        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",

        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",

Board is very clean. All TP's are still gold. No visible burnt traces or damage except for what I already specified.\nWill check for shorts. When you say check all rails, do you mean main power rails and sub rails? (Everything on pg 68) Or just main power rails? Diode or resistance mode?\n\nThanks."
