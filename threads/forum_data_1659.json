        "message":"Ok, i have a fully working 2010 13\" macbook pro. Had some minor water damage and we replaced keyboard backlight and battery. Now after several weeks of use there are random times when the computer lcd will sleep while the machine is in use. You can click any key and it will come back on.\n\nIf I am understanding correctly, this would be a current sensing issue correct? I am guessing there is a data line to the lcd. Is it I2C_BKL_1SDA?\nI am not sure where to chase this one down.\nThanks"
