            "message": "Hi there, I have an old MacBook Air that I'm using for practice (still very much a novice at this). Apparently it was water damaged, but I saw little evidence of that inside.\n\nI have most of the rails present, apart from <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_MCP</SIGNAL>.\n\nLooking at <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_CPU_IMVP</SIGNAL> is coming in on pin 21 okay, but nothing is coming out. I'm not sure if this is a fault with <CHIP>U7400</CHIP>, or if it's not being told to turn on. If I'm following the schematic correctly (and I may not be) <SIGNAL>IMVP_VR_ON</SIGNAL> should be coming from the SMC into pin 25, but I'm getting 0V at pin 25.\n\nI'm trying to figure out of this is an issue with <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> or the SMC, or perhaps something else that is preventing the VCORE from being created.\n\nI know this is very vague, and I apologise for that. Any suggestions as to what I might check next?\n\nThanks in advance,\nBruce"

I don't think there's a short to ground, and the area around <CHIP>U7500</CHIP> looks pretty tidy.\n\nI'm still waiting for my donor board to arrive, but when it does, do you think I should try replacing <CHIP>U7500</CHIP>?\n\nThanks again,\nBruce"
