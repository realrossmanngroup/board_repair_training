It will run fine though plugged in with no battery attached. I've replaced the ISL. PPBUS is at 12.63V. Battery is at 11.3V which is the same on a known-good board. Board was liquid-damaged and originally had 1.5V on PPBUS. I changed the ISL and that fixed that. I've measured every component in the power circuit and checked for any shorts or incorrect diode measurements compared to a good board. No difference that I can find. I've replaced Q7155, Q7130 and Q7180. Not sure what I'm missing."}

Current sensing, data lines, diode measurements on pins on ISL, surrounding component values and diode measurements - nothing is off.\n\nThe MagSafe light dies immediately when I plug it in. The power adapter is not happy. My main test adapter is not coming back on, even after sitting unplugged overnight. Looks like it was killed by the board. My other ones are managing to recover once I let them sit unplugged for about 10 minutes.\n\nSMC-bypass works fine without battery but does nothing with it plugged in. No power. Same situation as normal mode.\n\nSDA on battery connector: .502\nSCL on battery connector: .504\nR4439 and R5429 are measuring fine. Diode measurements are good also.\n\nCHGR_AMON is at 0V with battery and adapter plugged in.\nCHGR_BMON is at .052V\n\nDiode measurements on both AMON and BMON are both normal at .712 and .722 respectively.\n\nPPBUS (battery only): 11.34V\nPPBUS (power adapter only): 12.63V\nPPBUS during SMC-bypass (without battery plugged in): 12.32V\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor Reference:\n\nWith Known-Good Board (and same battery)\nCHGR_AMON: 1.367V\n.712 in diode mode\n\nCHGR_BMON: .052V\n . 724 in diode mode\n\nPPBUS (battery only) 11.34V\nPPBUS (power adapter only) 12.55V\n\nSMC bypass works fine with and without battery plugged in.

It's going into some type of serious shutdown\/failure. I just lost two more. They won't come back after letting them sit unplugged for about 30 minutes. It's a nice i7 16GB board but I might have to pull the plug on this soon. I can't keep losing good 85 watt adapters."}

These measurements might not be affected at all by the adapter being plugged in. Not sure though. You'll know better than me. My grasp of the circuit is limited. It does trigger the auto-turn-on so something is happening when you plug it in."}
