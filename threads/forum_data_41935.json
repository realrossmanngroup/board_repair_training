        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

        "CHGR_BMON": "What is CHGR_BMON? CHGR_BMON goes between the ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 that charges the battery & creates PPBUS_G3H and the SMC(system management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip) and provides current sensing information on battery charging to the SMC. If diagnostics reveal an off reading or failure with the charger current sense, this is a good place to start troubleshooting..",
        "CHGR_AMON": "What is CHGR_AMON? CHGR_AMON provides DC current sense information to the SMC(System management controller) or T2 chip(on machines where the SMC is integrated into the T2 chip). It comes from the battery charging chip that controls the laptop charger, battery charging, and creation of PPBUS_G3H(ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip depending on the logic board part number and model). This is used for sensors. If a DC current sense sensor is reading off in diagnostics, this is a place to start looking. .",

It will run fine though plugged in with no battery attached. I've replaced the ISL. PPBUS is at 12.63V. Battery is at 11.3V which is the same on a known-good board. Board was liquid-damaged and originally had 1.5V on PPBUS. I changed the ISL and that fixed that. I've measured every component in the power circuit and checked for any shorts or incorrect diode measurements compared to a good board. No difference that I can find. I've replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>. Not sure what I'm missing."
