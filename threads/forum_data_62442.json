Here are the symptoms and measurements. \n\nMacbook On Battery / Without Batter Connection --> all 4 USB-C ports shows the same --> 5.15v 30 mAmps - just stable, no jumps. \n\nRemoved the Board and it was dusty, cleaning with high-pressure air without damaging component but did not applies any isopropyl to check it under the microscope. While observing the board, saw that <CHIP>U5620</CHIP> has greenish corrosion on the right side of it. I see damage near pins 2 and 3 of <CHIP>U5620</CHIP>. \n\nThen I observed greenish corrosion on <RESISTOR>R9012</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R9010</RESISTOR>, and <CAPACITOR>C9002</CAPACITOR>. See the attached picture. Cleaned the area using Isopropyl alcohol. Please check the attached pictures.\n\nInformation about some Power Lines: \n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4_T_USBC</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_TA_G3H_F</SIGNAL> - 5.1v\n<SIGNAL>PPVBUS_USBC_TA</SIGNAL> - 0v - \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X</SIGNAL> - 0v (primary power for <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> missing) \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_3V3G3HRTC_X</SIGNAL> - 0v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 0v (we need to check the Charger Chip - <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>)\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> - 5.1v\nF7000 - 0v on <SIGNAL>PIN_1</SIGNAL>\nF7001 - 0v on <SIGNAL>PIN_1</SIGNAL>\n\nI am again lost.
