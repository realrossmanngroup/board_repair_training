If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

I could not pick up anything except that L7550 is 0V , schematic says should be 1.5V. So am not sure if that is my problem or that the signal is not present because the board is not posting ...Also <RESISTOR>R7555</RESISTOR> is 0V on both sides , am not sure if thats okay as well. did replace <CHIP>U7400</CHIP> ,  but nothing changed"
