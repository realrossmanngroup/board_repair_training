She went to go plug it in and then she just heard a [B]pop [/B]from around the area just above the keyboard. \n\nI have removed the board from the chassis, I do not have a sacrificial power supply so unfortunately I can't tell you how much the current draw is.  I will also mention that I made the rookie mistake of measure resistance with the system still powered up.  I usually don't do that but I'm hoping I didn't damage anything (but I could be totally wrong).\n\nThere is no water damage that I can see, I can attach photos if need be.\n\nHere are measurements and observations so far:\n\nWhen first connecting the magsafe, it turns green, then turns orange.  Sometimes I get fan-spin and sometimes I don't.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 8.6V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> = 8.6V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS_8</SIGNAL>.6V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL</SIGNAL>=15.03V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL>=15.03\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>=3.417\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>=3.350V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>=5.024V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL>=0V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>=0V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>=3.350V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL>=0V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL>=3.490V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL>=0V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4_S4SW_SNS</SIGNAL>=0V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S3</SIGNAL>=0V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V05_SUS</SIGNAL>=1.059V\n<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL>=0V\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>=0V\n\nI sort of lost track of what I have measured and what I haven't measured.  but I do understand based on Louis' videos that in order to get S0, you need S3, and to get S3, you need S4.  I know a lot of the S4 stuff comes from <CHIP>U0500</CHIP> but I'm not really sure what makes <CHIP>U0500</CHIP> happy to turn on <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>.\n\nAny directional pointers?"

The first two attempts failed, and when I went for the third attempt the magsafe connection arc'd and messed up one of the balls on the magsafe connector of the DC-In Logic board, so I'm going to order a new one from the store.\n\nWill recheck everything once I can safely power up the board again in the event I caused more damaged."
