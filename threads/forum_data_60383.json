        "message":"Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm trying to help a friend with their Macbook Air.  She went to go plug it in and then she just heard a [B]pop [\/B]from around the area just above the keyboard. \n\nI have removed the board from the chassis, I do not have a sacrificial power supply so unfortunately I can't tell you how much the current draw is.  I will also mention that I made the rookie mistake of measure resistance with the system still powered up.  I usually don't do that but I'm hoping I didn't damage anything (but I could be totally wrong).\n\nThere is no water damage that I can see, I can attach photos if need be.\n\nHere are measurements and observations so far:\n\nWhen first connecting the magsafe, it turns green, then turns orange.  Sometimes I get fan-spin and sometimes I don't.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.6V\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS = 8.6V\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS_8.6V\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL=15.03V\nPPDCIN_G3H=15.03\nPP3V42_G3H=3.417\nPPVRTC_G3H=3.350V\nPP5V_S5=5.024V\nPP5V_S4RS3=0V\nPP5V_S0=0V\nPP3V3_S5=3.350V\nPP3V3_S4=0V\nPP3V3_SUS=3.490V\nPP3V3_S3=0V\nPP3V3_S4_S4SW_SNS=0V\nPP1V8_S3=0V\nPP1V05_SUS=1.059V\nPP1V5_S0=0V\nPM_SLP_S4_L=0V\n\nI sort of lost track of what I have measured and what I haven't measured.  but I do understand based on Louis' videos that in order to get S0, you need S3, and to get S3, you need S4.  I know a lot of the S4 stuff comes from U0500 but I'm not really sure what makes U0500 happy to turn on PM_SLP_S4_L.\n\nAny directional pointers?"

I tried looking around on the forum but didn't find how to get into SMC bypass mode without being in the chassis.  If SMC bypass mode is what I think it is (pressing the power button for 10-15 seconds and then connecting the magsafe) I tried that early on and wasn't able to get it to boot but I can put everything back and try again."
