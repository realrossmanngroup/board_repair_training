        "A2337": "What is A2337? A2337 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Late 2020 M1 with EMC 3598, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-02016..",
        "820-02016": "What is 820-02016? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",
        "LCDBKLT_EN_L": "What is LCDBKLT_EN_L? This signal enables the backlight when it is low.  _L means the signal asserts itself when the voltage is low. This signal needs to be low to enable backlight. .",
        "DP_INT_HPD_3V3_CONN": "What is DP_INT_HPD_3V3_CONN? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created.."

Customer said after removing a charger the screen went dark.\n\nWe've assessed the board and the backlight circuit shows no short. Screen has been tested with known good board and is working fine.\n\nQP800 voltages below:\n\nPIN 4: 12V\nPIN 3: 12V\nPIN: 6/5/2/1: As soon as the board is connected to power these show 12V but within 30 seconds the voltage drops and eventually ends up at 0v\n\nChecked the components for <SIGNAL>LCDBKLT_EN_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>BKLT_SD</SIGNAL> and these all test fine (compared against known good) but SD isn't pulling the line to 0v.\n\nQP800 has then been replaced but no change.\n\nDespite the other input and output values of UP800 being ok, this has been replaced to rule out a bad backlight driver. Still no change.\n\nChecked the resistors, fb lines are all ok.\n\nWould really appreciate some direction of where else to check as I've cross compared the full circuit and I'm a bit stumped.\n\nThank you!"
