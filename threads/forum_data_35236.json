The liquid damage _appears_ to have been pooling around the edge of the board with some residual grubbiness around the SMC and the RAM chips.  \n\nThe G3H rails are present and the green->orange charger light is as normal.\n\nAn oddity is that <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> oscillates between 3.3 and 3.42v.\n\nThe <SIGNAL>PPV5_S5</SIGNAL> rail is present but again it oscillates.  This time between 3.6 and 5v.  \n\nno other power rails are active.\n\non <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> I'm getting lows on EN and EN1 and on EN2 I'm getting an oscillating 0-3v. \n\nany ideas of where to hunt please?\n\nthanks\njustin"
