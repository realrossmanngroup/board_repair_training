Before taking the damage TB off I thought I would try using both my test rig (not sure if the TB works on it) and also on a brand new one. Both are doing weird things. To best describe what is happening I done a short video which can be viewed here:\n\n[MEDIA=youtube]Y9TwW0KiAZ8[\/MEDIA]\n\nI've checked the JT700 (which seems to be the touchscreen connector of the touchbar) using diode mode and they all seems to give a value which Is the same as my donor board. I can't test the voltages as they are located underneath the logicboard and it won't show a display on an external screen (not sure if the M1 work without the screen connected) \n\nI've also swopped screens  for a brand new one and it's doing the same thing.\n\nCan anyone shed some light on this?"}
