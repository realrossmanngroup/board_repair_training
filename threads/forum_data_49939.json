I traced it back to <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> and found that itself is not getting any voltages except <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> on pin 13. The rest of the missing voltages are S5 voltages. Is S5 supposed to come on even when a light has not been produced at the charger tip? <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> are both missing atm. Furthemore the one wire circuit is receiving <SIGNAL>SM_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> and it is outputting voltage.\n\nHere are my voltage measurements of the G3Hot lines.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 8.1V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS</SIGNAL> 8.1V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS</SIGNAL> 8.1V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL</SIGNAL> 16.5V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> 16.5V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> 3.40V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> 0.33\n\nI found that <CHIP>U1900</CHIP> is outputting on pin 1 a 32khz clock signal.
