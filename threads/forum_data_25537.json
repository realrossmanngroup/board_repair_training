I can see a charging logo at the top of the screen and a orange light at the magsafe. Anyone knows what can be causing this issue? during visual inspection i noticed a Corroded <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> and missing resistor <RESISTOR>R7006</RESISTOR> near the wifi card. could this be my root cause or its a faulty isl chip?\nThanks!"
