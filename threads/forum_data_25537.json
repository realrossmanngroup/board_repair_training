        "message":"Hello everyone, i got a macbook air a1466 820-00165 that when you unplug the magsafe charger it automatically shuts off. I can see a charging logo at the top of the screen and a orange light at the magsafe. Anyone knows what can be causing this issue? during visual inspection i noticed a Corroded D7005 and missing resistor r7006 near the wifi card. could this be my root cause or its a faulty isl chip?\nThanks!"
