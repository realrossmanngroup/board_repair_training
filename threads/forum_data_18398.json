Was cleaned, repaired backlight.\n\nI now have fast fans  and it doesn't recognise any ssd (tested with known good ones) \nI really dont know where to look. SSD gets power.ect, entire circuit looks fine, no components ripped off\/corroded.\n\nAlso oddly enough i cant get it to boot selection or diagnostics. Im starting to suspect the SMC, reflowing it however has made no difference. \nChecked the entire board for clues under a microscope and couldnt see anything abnormal.\n\nI really dont know where to start."}

I have not yet tried with a USB keyboard as the internal components are known good parts. \n\nIt gets to question mark, i have managed to boot it to an installer but it was running slow.\nSo obviously there is a sensor error (probably temperature).\n\nI will have a bit more of a fiddle when im next in the workshop"}
