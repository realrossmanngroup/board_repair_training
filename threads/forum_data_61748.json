            "message": "Hello everyone!\n\n\n\nHave a weird issue on 2019 macbook air:\n\n\n\nIt does power on, however there is a question marc and while try to online restore the os – no success. It’s either stop on the downloading stage or during the installation. It once even got to the point where it ask you for the language but then it frizzed there. Tried DFU restore – goes well but does nor reboot after its done and shows padlock.\n\nNo liquid damage on the board, look clean and like no one played with it.\n\nHowever I noticed that the led (<DIODE>D6959</DIODE>) on the board is not lighting up. After short troubleshoot I found that the led polarity are inversed I presume from factory?! Removed and placed it in the right direction, does light up now, however its dim and get only 2.3v and should be 2.7v if I am not mistaken. <RESISTOR>R6959</RESISTOR> get 3.29v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC</SIGNAL> should be more as well I guess?\n\nHave the voltage on all coils except the one for CPUGT witch I presume is normal since there is no load on gpu.\n\nNotes:\n\nBattery is charging.\nDoes see usb key if plugget but obviously does not boot from it.\n\nAfter disconecting and reconnecting the battery, does not power on. Need to plug the charger and after that will power on (from buttery or charger), not sure if thats normal.\n\n\nWill appreciate any hints.\n\n\n\nThank you!"

            "message": "Hi 2informaticos,\nI would like to clarify that if i disconnect the battery and plug it back, it will not start no mather how long i will press power or keyboard button until i plug the charger. After i plug the charger it will act normally on power button press (except the question mark issue)\n\nAfter that i tried the dfu restore, i am still not able to recover the machine with internet recovery\nEdit: if i start it in a disk mode, the other mac shows \"the disk you inserted was not readable by this computer\".\n\nNot sure if the issue is my cable. I try to use the same one that i was trying to use to do the DFU restore (usb a to usb c) since the second mac is an 2017 air and dont have usb c...\n\nAlso for general learning, what will happens if you disconnect the battery while <DIODE>D6959</DIODE> lights when charger is removed? Maybe i did it because like i am saying the polarity of <DIODE>D6959</DIODE> was inverted.\n\n\nAlso a side note: after the DFU is completed, the the mac does not restart on its own. Not sure if that metter how ever i do see a mac log and the loading bar on it for ~15 seconds before it shows padlock on the second mac\n\n\nEdit: another thing i noticed. If i try to do the internet restore only on charger power (battery not plug in) the mouse is not responsible: the cursor moves super slow and whit a lag. I presume it shouldn be this way witch leed me to belive that there really is an issue with power delivery somewhere\n\nThank you!"
