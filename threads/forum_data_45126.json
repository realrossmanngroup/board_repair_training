    "definitions": {
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "Q5040": "What is Q5040? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "PM_DSW_PWRGD": "What is PM_DSW_PWRGD? The \"PM_DSW_PWRGD\" signal in a MacBook stands for \"Deep Sleep Well Power Good” and is required for the machine to power on & post..",
        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",
        "S5_PWRGD": "What is S5_PWRGD? The S5_PWRGD signal is a status signal that indicates the S5 rails are on and functioning properly. If this is not present, check the S5 rails to see if they are functioning, and the chip that creates S5_PWRGD..",
        "U7941": "What is U7941? a CHIP.",
        "R2584": "What is R2584? a RESISTOR.",
        "XDP_PCH_S5_PWRGD": "What is XDP_PCH_S5_PWRGD? a SIGNAL.",
        "U2800": "What is U2800? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_BATLOW_L": "What is SMC_BATLOW_L? SMC_BATLOW_L refers to a power management signal that indicates a low battery condition. The \"_L\" suffix suggests that this is an active-low signal, meaning that it becomes low when the battery reaches a low voltage threshold.."
