        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

Replaced that one and when the IC was removed checked for shorts on 2 feedback lines but they were OK. Voltage on pin 3/4 is 20v but still no backlight. Checked <SIGNAL>BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> it has 1.47v and <SIGNAL>BKL_EN</SIGNAL> is moving in a range from 0.3-0.8v so too low. No short on these lines and the resistors have the correct values. I have tried to replace another <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> but still the same, any ideas?"

I have only checked pin 5, 6 and 7 for continuity before, should i remove <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> to check more? I get 0.576 on pin 1 from <RESISTOR>R7715</RESISTOR> when measuring resistance to ground so I assume its safe to say its connected with pin 3 of U7t01, otherwise it would be shorted.Is that a correct assumption?"
