Initially it was stuck at 5V, ISL6294 had to be replaced and I restored the sensing resistors and traces witch bring back 20V and it is now able to charge a battery.\nWithout the battery it stabilizes to 0.40A and cycle again .\n\nThe fan spins very high for couple of seconds and it shuts down and cycle again.\nNoticed that PP3V3_S2 was missing and shorted with 0.077 diode mode reading. I compared with a known working board and it is supposed to be 0.300.\nI traced back the short to the BT\/Wifi module, I isolated it by removing RD810 and now I am back to 0.330 Diode mode reading.\n\nUnfortunately PP3V3_S2 was still missing, so I checked P3V3_S2_EN and found it missing (0.6V) and shorted (diode mode 0.065 instead of 0.350), I removed RC714 and I can say short is coming from U8100.\n\nDo we need to replace it with one coming from the same exact board model?"}
