This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. ."

Magsafe LED now works but <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is only 1V.\nSame after <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> was replaced.\n\nPower draw on PSU is 0.017 amps.\nHistory unknown, no liquid damage spotted.\n\nThe schematic I have is password protected so can't copy/paste/search which makes tracking this hard. I am looking around page 54 (PBus Supply & Battery Charger) but am going in circles.\n\nAny advice appreciated."
