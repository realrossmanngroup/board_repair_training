        "message":"client brought in a 15\" late 2013, powers on but does not finish booting from any drive, os, or even safe mode.  so first i tried re-soldering U9300 and changing C9364 330 uf poly-tant cap but the new replacements i had were a little too tall and couldn't properly under heatsink, but i tried :(. when i would power on it would chime and display image and then short off a few seconds later and auto reboot.  this got progressively worse and shorter after a few times.  so i put back the original cap and moved the U9300 from another board but it's still pretty much doing same thing, chiming then shorting out real quick now and now there is no image at all. did i fuck it up really bad? also left fan was bad, maybe that contributed to original failure? i see the early 2013 its usually that ISL controller solder but is it GPU on these ones? cuz I don't have a bga machine"
