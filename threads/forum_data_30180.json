            "message": "client brought in a 15\" late 2013, powers on but does not finish booting from any drive, os, or even safe mode.  so first i tried re-soldering <CHIP>U9300</CHIP> and changing <CAPACITOR>C9364</CAPACITOR> 330 uf poly-tant cap but the new replacements i had were a little too tall and couldn't properly under heatsink, but i tried :(. when i would power on it would chime and display image and then short off a few seconds later and auto reboot.  this got progressively worse and shorter after a few times.  so i put back the original cap and moved the <CHIP>U9300</CHIP> from another board but it's still pretty much doing same thing, chiming then shorting out real quick now and now there is no image at all. did i fuck it up really bad? also left fan was bad, maybe that contributed to original failure? i see the early 2013 its usually that ISL controller solder but is it GPU on these ones? cuz I don't have a bga machine"
