Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",

I can see trace of yaourt neard LCD connector, on diode, bigcoil and the two caps.\nWhen connected to power, magsafe get green, then orange, fan start to spin for 3 seconds, I hear  Chemie... and reboot, same again and again.\n\nI can't measure any voltage on those caps and coil.\n\n\nThanks\nSam"
