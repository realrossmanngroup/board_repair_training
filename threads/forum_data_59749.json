I removed L4500 and cleaned/dug around the roasted section and all layers seem to be clean and seperate so I suspect the short is somewhere else.\n\nAny suggestions on a likely culprit on this rail, any \"usual suspects\"?\n\nJust thought I'd ask before I inject voltage on the line since Banjo (<CHIP>U7800</CHIP>) is on this rail and I don't want to fry him...\n\nCheers,\n\nMick\n\n[ATTACH alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-29 at 5.23.32 pm.jpg\"]59342[/ATTACH]"
