I only noticed because L7210 was missing I have no other history and suspect no prior liquid damage.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> has 20v present but both <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> on F7040 both showing 0.6v. I removed F7040 and measured both to ground and short is on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. I soldered a wire to <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and put around 8v through - it was drawing close to 1.8A but no heat? Should i go higher?\n\nThanks"
