I only noticed because L7210 was missing I have no other history and suspect no prior liquid damage.\n\nppdcin_g3h has 20v present but both ppvbat_g3h and ppbus_g3h on F7040 both showing 0.6v. I removed F7040 and measured both to ground and short is on ppbus_g3h. I soldered a wire to ppbus_g3h and put around 8v through - it was drawing close to 1.8A but no heat? Should i go higher?\n\nThanks"}
