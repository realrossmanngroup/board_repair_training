I plug it in, boot it up, it shows a charging lightning bolt but when I click on the battery it says \"battery not charging\". Probed around isl6259, all resistors seem to be within spec. Any idea? I'd hate to scrap this just because of the battery not charging. It was liquid damaged, but has been cleaned since. isl6259 is new as well."
