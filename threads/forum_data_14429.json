I know there are several it checks, but is there a way to narrow down which sensor exactly has failed?\n\nThanks in advance!"

I had a customer ask, and I'm not entirely certain. I know the 2015 models had some sort of LCD identifier information in the LCD assembly or something, correct? I want to make sure I don't mis-inform them."
