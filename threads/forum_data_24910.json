This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

Unfortunately I don't have this dual diode here, which is SBR0330CW. Can I replace it with a similar component from a different board? For example, I have one BAT30CWFILM here and the specs on the datasheet are similar as far as I undestand it."
