        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",

            "message": "Working on a 2nd 12\" Retina in 2 days, after not seeing any for a year (!!). Still not very comfortable with these boards, so I apologize for any stumbling/confusion on my part. If I missed anything (different power rails on this one, etc), just let me know. Feel free to be short/impatient with me, I don't mind at all:\n\n1. No liquid damage, unit \"just wouldn't turn on one day\".\n2. <SIGNAL>PP3V3R3V0_AON</SIGNAL> is measuring 2.44v, no short present (rtg 18kOhm).\n3. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is .015v; no short here either.\n4. <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> is 1.286v\n5. <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> is 5.15v, which I believe is correct with no battery connected. If this is incorrect, please let me know.\n6. <RESISTOR>R7110</RESISTOR>/11 are giving some funny readings, but they match another board I have here, so I think it might be normal. If I need to remove these to measure, let me know.\n\nIf I missed anything, please let me know. Thanks in advance for any help! I really appreciate it.\n\nAlso, as an aside: Do you guys work on these 12\" retina boards with hot air or soldering tweezers? If we start getting more of these in, I'd like to be better equipped to work on them easily. We don't mess with iPhone/iPad repairs, but I imagine they're similar (~) to these 12\" retina boards."
