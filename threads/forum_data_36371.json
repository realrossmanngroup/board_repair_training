            "message": "Hey guys,\n\nHave a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B Macbook Pro here with some frustrating issues. We get a green light on the AC adapter however, no fanspin/chime, and the CPU and GPU start to get hot (could be due to lack of fan spin?)\n\nChecked all of the voltages, the only outlier is <SIGNAL>PPVIN_SW_T29BST</SIGNAL>, which is 2.82V. (see attached image for all voltages)\n\nFrom this I checked <TRANSISTOR>Q3880</TRANSISTOR> as this seem to be where it's made, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is a steady 12.6V and the gaet for <TRANSISTOR>Q3880</TRANSISTOR> is 12.2V. At the drain of <TRANSISTOR>Q3880</TRANSISTOR> however, the voltage is a meager 0.3V. I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q3880</TRANSISTOR> to no effect.\n\nDiode mode to ground at drain of <TRANSISTOR>Q3880</TRANSISTOR> is 0.4V (only works with negative on component, positive on ground? I've not noticed this with other components when diode checking, or maybe I'm going mad), resistance is 100kohmn (slowly goes down),\n\nConsequentially, <SIGNAL>PP15V_T29</SIGNAL> is 0.32V\n\nPlus, I am going to assume that <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> is supposed to be 5V given the name, my schematic shows 3.3V however so for consistency, I still put 3.3V.\n\nHelp would be appreciated!"
