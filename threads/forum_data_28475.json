S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. .",

            "message": "i been saving some boards that I'm unable to fix , they all seems to have same problem quarter fin spin , green light ok , 12.6v ok , <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL> ok , but on <SIGNAL>5V_S3</SIGNAL> voltage go back and foward , thinking that maybe something is getting the voltage down ahead , i decide to remove the resistor that enable the s0 lines for example on the first board I'm going to ask for help <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> the resistor is <RESISTOR>R7978</RESISTOR> once this resistor is removed , <SIGNAL>5V_S3</SIGNAL> go back to normal , 5v steady , then i imagine one of the s0 voltages was guilty maybe a transistor whatever , then i isolate them and i when 1 by one , i finally found that problem was coming from =<SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0_REG</SIGNAL> , i remove <CHIP>U7770</CHIP> and the fluctuation stops and all other rails when back to normal , then i imagine , that my problem was somewhere on <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL> then i locate all the nets , and remove all possible ic , transistors , and caps 1 by one , and resolding <CHIP>U7770</CHIP> to see if stuff when back to normal and no as soon as i resolder <CHIP>U7770</CHIP> voltage start fluctuation again , i also replace <CHIP>U7770</CHIP> and nothing. no short to ground on the line.\n\nthe only one i can't remove and test is <CHIP>U1800</CHIP>.\n\ni have different boards with exact same issue a macbook air board 2012 , a 2015 , and this pro 2012 , I'm stuck i think my approach to this problem is incorrect , thank you for your help."
