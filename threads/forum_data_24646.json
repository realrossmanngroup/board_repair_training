        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "KERNEL_TASK": "What is KERNEL_TASK? KERNEL_TASK is a process that will take up all the CPU and cause the macbook to run very slow when there is a sensor issue. When you see KERNEL_TASK as a process taking up lots of CPU and the machine is working very slow or has loud fans, use a program like hwmonitor to check voltage, amperage, and temperature sensors and look for something that doesnâ€™t look right.."

            "message": "We're working on an early 2011 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> Macbook Pro ( <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B ) that was brought in for light liquid damage.  There was no corrosion or any signs of actual liquid contact to the board.  We did replace the keyboard.  The device boots normally except it almost immediately starts to appear very sluggish.  When running TOP to see what resources are being used there's a system process called \"<SIGNAL>KERNEL_TASK</SIGNAL>\" that is chewing up 300% of all resources.  Looks like the machine is basically DOS'ing itself.  From a quick search online this can be caused by several things but most point to a bad sensor.  Can you point me in the right direction ?"
