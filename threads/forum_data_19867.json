            "message": "Hi there, I'm very new to this, so please go easy on me.\n\nI have a late 2008 <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1286</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> that is in apparently perfect working order, with only one small exception and that is that the little battery indicator light in the side doesn't work. My first thought was that the little button/light assembly was broken, so I bought a replacement, however, this didn't fix the problem. I guess it's possible that the replacement was broken too, but I think it's unlikely.\n\nI have the schematic and boardview for this model, but I'm a little lost as to what needs checking, especially as the button assembly is not included as part of the board schematic.\n\nI have tested the connectors and cables that link the button to the logic board, and everything seems to be fine. The board is clean, and doesn't appear to have any signs of water damage. There are no other faults that I am aware of.\n\nI would appreciate any assistance in diagnosing the issue.\n\nThanks,\nBruce"
