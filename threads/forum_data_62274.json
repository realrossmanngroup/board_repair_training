I replaced <RESISTOR>R3070</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R3058</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R3057</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R3072</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R3033</RESISTOR>, and <SIGNAL>C3101_X</SIGNAL>\nwhen I connect a charger I get 20V and it goes up to 0.79A then the Apple logo comes on but it'll be stuck on the logo and goes down to 0.40A, 0.30A, and A jumps up and down. Also, I noticed the <SIGNAL>D3100_X</SIGNAL> is damaged as well but I can't find <SIGNAL>D3100_X</SIGNAL>(NSR20F40NX_G) online to replace it. Would it be alright if I take it off and test the board or any advice on where I should look for?\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60395[/ATTACH]"
