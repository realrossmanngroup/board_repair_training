    "definitions": {
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "C7094": "What is C7094? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "AVREF_SMC": "What is AVREF_SMC? AVREF_SMC is a reference voltage provided to the SMC so that its sensors have a reference to work from, this should be 3.3v.",
        "PLT_RST_BUF_L": "What is PLT_RST_BUF_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on.."
