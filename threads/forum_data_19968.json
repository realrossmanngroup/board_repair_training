Even these answers are a bit confusing, I'll have to reread and ponder on them a bit for it to make sense.  I did some experimenting and just went ahead and put one of these resistors (or whatever in hell they are -LOL) in and it worked!  I already have a pile of donor boards and pulled all these filters off already. I do get them from DHGate & AliExpress : )  I always knew I could put a wire in place of a filter like on iPad and iPhone. I thought that maybe there would be a difference in a MacBook. Nonetheless, I have been getting out of that habit and putting the proper components in their place because if something happens I'd like to have the fuse blow instead of passing through a wire and damaging something else.  I am thankful for your guys's feedback !  You can close this one out : ) [/B]"
