I have a few boards <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> from ranging from 2013-2015 I’m looking to buy a test enclosure I found a few 2013 and A few 2015 Enclosures \nBoth seem pretty similar. Are all these board compatible with either of these enclosures ?\nBy enclosures I mean the case with screen and palest battery."
