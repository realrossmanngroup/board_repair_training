However, now, one of the ports puls 19.8V from ampmeter (sometimes it puls 5V and 0.40A on that same port), and 5V and 0A (always) on the other port.\n\nNot sure what this means, but when conecting power cable to the UF500 port, FF201 stays at 0V, but CF501 keeps with 5V.\n\nWhen conecting to the UF400 port, both (CF401 and FF200) stays at 5V.\n\nBoth fuses are ok, and both have 5V when using UF400 port.\n\nCan it be a bad UF500? If yes, how can I be sure?"
