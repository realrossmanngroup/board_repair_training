Very clean. NO chime, No backlight. Only real corrosion was on R3201 on the PP3V3RHV pad which was entirely gone. I ran a Jumper from the thunderbolt connector pad, to the replacement resistor and tied it all back in. But I can not for the life of me find where this thing is shorting to ground on the PPVCC rail. I put 1.5v to the rail but nothing got hot. (not sure anything will at that low voltage.) Am I just stupid and don't know how a multimeter works?"}

This one is the only one I get tone to ground in continuity mode. This is a very different world from cell phones. Two rails is all I'm used to so please forgive my ignorance. I have good voltage on all the other rails when i plug it in to the charger. There was corrosion around the JTAG connector and the KB backlight connector. I removed both and re-tinned he pads and reinstalled the connectors. Fan spins up and I have Orange light on the magsafe and no caps lock light."}
