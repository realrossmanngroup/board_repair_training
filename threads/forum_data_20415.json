Only real corrosion was on <RESISTOR>R3201</RESISTOR> on the PP3V3RHV pad which was entirely gone. I ran a Jumper from the thunderbolt connector pad, to the replacement resistor and tied it all back in. But I can not for the life of me find where this thing is shorting to ground on the PPVCC rail. I put 1.5v to the rail but nothing got hot. (not sure anything will at that low voltage.) Am I just stupid and don't know how a multimeter works?"
