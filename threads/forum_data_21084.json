        "820-4924": "What is 820-4924? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",

        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",

I get a green light when I plug in the charger but nothing comes on nor does the fan spin(which is common for these 2015's).\n\nI unplugged all the external components(kbd,tpad,screen, etc) except for the dc-in board and I plugged in another one to make sure that wasn't the issue. Here are some voltages I get with no components plugged in\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> - 5.04v then every 3seconds it goes to 5.17v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S4</SIGNAL> - 0v then pulses to 5.17v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> - 0v then pulses to 5.17v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> - 0v then pulses to 5.17v\n<SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 0v then pulses to around 1.7v\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - steady 12.58v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> - constant 3.36v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> - around 0.08v then pulses every 3seconds to 3.32v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> - around 0.4v then pulses to 3.32v\n\nPin 1 of <CHIP>U1950</CHIP>(<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL>) - 0v then pulses to 3.35\nPin 2 (<SIGNAL>CPUVR_PGOOD_R</SIGNAL>) - 0.08 then pulses 3.3v\n<CHIP>U6100</CHIP> and the traces look perfectly fine.\nI checked about 10 spi termination resistors and they all measured the proper resistance. All the areas are spotless so I don't think there was any liquid damage causing this.\n\nI tried booting in smc bypass mode without the battery plugged in. After doing it the fan will spin for like half a second then stop and every few seconds it will keep doing the same pulse."
