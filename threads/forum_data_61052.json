See attached. Now to me this looks like an LCD fault. The device boots and chimes. I have done the usual SMC and NVRAM resets. I have removed the Logicboard and there was corrosion around Q1840 and U7840 which I have cleaned up with some Isopropyl Alcohol. J8300 looks fine. I don't have a known working screen so I was hoping for some feedback on this before I order a new display."}
