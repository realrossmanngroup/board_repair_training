I tried 3 times.\n\nAs for R7202, that is correct. It is not related in PM_SLP_S4_L generation, rather as input voltage for U7200 which releases CPUVR_PGOOD, which goes to U1950, creates PM_S0_PGOOD, responsible for creating SYS_PWROK_R, after R1962 it is PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK, and finally comes to CPU, which then releases PM_SLP_S4_L.\n\nWell, either my eyes are not seeing good or something, but you say that even without U7200, there should be a pulse on PM_SLP_S4_L from CPU?"}
