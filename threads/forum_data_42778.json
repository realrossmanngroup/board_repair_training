I dont have for now usb-c to hdmi so can check if external display is working. \n\n\nChecked EDP area and <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is missing and than <SIGNAL>PANEL_P5V_EN</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PANEL_P3V3_EN</SIGNAL> are 0 too. All tests are done with good  lcd conected. \n\n\nI see that <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is coming from CPU. \n\n\nAny suggestion ?"
