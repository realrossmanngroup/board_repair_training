        "D7012": "What is D7012? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year model macbook airs, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "Q7130": "What is Q7130? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

No shorts on PPBUS, 3.42v and DC-IN lines. No power on PPBUS or 3.42. <DIODE>D7012</DIODE> is present, tried another <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> with no result. All resistors around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> measure OK, battery resistors measure OK. Re-balled SMC also didn't fix it. It can still be powered on from battery, not from charger after all above. On DC-IN line I have 312mah. Have also tried another IO board + cable. Board looks super clean no corrosion. Inspected battery connecter and IO connector all look mighty fine. Anything I forgot to check? Also tried different chargers."
