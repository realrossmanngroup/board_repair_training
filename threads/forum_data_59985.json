Traced this down to see that signal drops at pin 1 resistor R5170 when jumpering the SMC_ONOFF to ground... but it isn't turning machine off or registering that the power button is being pushed. Everything else on this mac works...  boots and runs but the power button doesnt work. \n\nJust wanted to double check: anything besides the SMC that could override that signal? or just swap out the SMC?s"}

Oddly I thought replacing SMC would also fix no light on charger but it did not.\n\nBoots and runs normal from what I can tell but no charger light? Checking the boards. Tried changing the DCIN board... cable maybe?"}
