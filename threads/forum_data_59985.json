        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_ONOFF": "What is SMC_ONOFF? SMC_ONOFF is a signal that tells the machine that the power button has been pressed so it knows to turn on, or turn off. .",
        "R5170": "What is R5170? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PM_PWRBTN_L": "What is PM_PWRBTN_L? PM_PWRBTN_L refers to the power button signal line. This line is used to initiate the power-on sequence of the laptop. The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. ."

Traced this down to see that signal drops at pin 1 resistor <RESISTOR>R5170</RESISTOR> when jumpering the <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF</SIGNAL> to ground... but it isn't turning machine off or registering that the power button is being pushed. Everything else on this mac works...  boots and runs but the power button doesnt work. \n\nJust wanted to double check: anything besides the SMC that could override that signal? or just swap out the SMC?s"
