Suddenly shut itself off, then was working day after and again shut off. Turn on, shut off. I found some solder balls around U3740, but they could be a result of previous technician work since I see that CPU, SMC and BIOS were reworked on. (CPU and SMC missing glue, BIOS probably replaced). However not looks burned on the board. It's actually pretty clean.\n\nPP3V42, PPBUS, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0 present. \n\nPPVCC_S0_CPU not present. Barely 0.008V.\n\nDCPS shows around 105mA draw upon boot.\n\nSeems like CPU is not being told to turn on."}
