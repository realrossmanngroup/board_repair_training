            "message": "Client came in with a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> acting up, keyboard only types in caps and other random stuff. So suspected liquid damage. Saw some corrosion on the board and coffee on the keyboard. Boards was working, changed some bad IC, ofcourse after I did, it stopped :P. Now fan spins, stops, starts to spin again and at some point spin very fast. No display (no backlight no 3.3v). I have all voltages including RAM and CPU, mouse flashes and have 32 clock for CPU. Here some images of the liquid damage and IC I replaced. I also replaced <CHIP>U3710</CHIP> (some corrosion there) and <CHIP>U6101</CHIP>, can these IC cause this issue? Not sure my donor boards are OK.\n\nNear <TRANSISTOR>Q1840</TRANSISTOR>:\n[url]https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/repairdesk/uploads/gallery/1054720191106_141653.jpg.jpg[/url]\n\n<CHIP>U6101</CHIP>:\n[url]https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/repairdesk/uploads/gallery/1055020191106_141647.jpg.jpg[/url]\n\n<CAPACITOR>C5008</CAPACITOR> & <CHIP>U3710</CHIP>:\n[url]https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/repairdesk/uploads/gallery/1055220191106_141640.jpg.jpg[/url]"
