Have got all <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SO</SIGNAL> rails , however my S4 rails is only sitting at 0.923V , I do not have a short. Initially <RESISTOR>R7563</RESISTOR>,<RESISTOR>R7560</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7561</RESISTOR> were corroded , I replaced all 3 resistors and also touch on the pads , just to be safe , I replaced <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>. I am partially in S0 state , but that's all I get , am happy to provide more upon request . m\n\nplease pardon me if am not detailed enough, whatever details is required of me , I shall provide."
