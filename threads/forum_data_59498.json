Have got all PP3V3_SO rails , however my S4 rails is only sitting at 0.923V , I do not have a short. Initially R7563,R7560 and R7561 were corroded , I replaced all 3 resistors and also touch on the pads , just to be safe , I replaced U7501. I am partially in S0 state , but that's all I get , am happy to provide more upon request . m\n\nplease pardon me if am not detailed enough, whatever details is required of me , I shall provide."}
