        "A1278": "What is A1278? A1278 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook or Macbook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2254, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2327, 820-2530, 820-2879, 820-2936, 820-3115..",
        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line..",
        "U6900": "What is U6900? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. ."

            "message": "TLDR: system would boot but no chime, no screen, only fan spinning up to high speed after 1-2 minutes. Isolated logic board showed expected voltages except <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> (0V and unexpected OPEN LINE to Ground when unpowered). Problem resolved after several minutes of rest. Should I consider replacing a chip that's on its way to failing?\n\nDETAILS\nI'm working on the same system mentioned in [URL='https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/solved-<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>-<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a-only-0-3v-on-adapter-sense-pin.64156/#post-101360']this post[/URL]. After about a week running stable, I eventually removed the drive (SATA SSD) to scan for issues and do a fresh OS install. **Possible mistake during reassembly - see below** Upon boot up, the system chimed but no screen activity and fan went from normal to fast after 1-2 minutes. I forced a shutdown to not risk thermal damage. Waited and retried - no chime, no screen, fan went from normal to fast after 1-2 minutes. Tried to reset NVRAM and SMC; no indication of success, no chime, no screen, fan went normal then fast after a minute or so. Removed the logic board, checked voltages and resistance...\n\n**Possible mistake**\nDuring disassembly, I noticed a piece of thin metal from the display cable retainer (pictured) was lose laying between the frame and logic board near <RESISTOR>R6929</RESISTOR>.\n\n(from rough memory)\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> ~3.5V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> ~3.5V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> ~3.5V\n[U]Unexpected find [/U]=> <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> (@J6900, <RESISTOR>R6900</RESISTOR>, <CHIP>U6900</CHIP>) 0V and test to ground shows OPEN LINE\n\nAfter a while of checking voltages and resistance with nothing else out of the ordinary (limited in my knowledge), I took a break, came back and <SIGNAL>ADAPTER_SENSE</SIGNAL> is now showing 40k resistance. Reassembled system, boots as if nothing ever happened.\n\nIs this the sign of a chip starting to fail? Anything I should try or check?"
