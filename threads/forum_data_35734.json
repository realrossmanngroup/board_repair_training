Check usual spots for corrosion U1900, U1950, SPI termination resistors and traces to the BIOS. Also make sure PP3v3_S5 is present and PP3v3_SUS is present at the BIOS and in general. So many things can cause missing S4 rails."}

Also check PPVRTC. Check for power cycling on 5V_S4 preferably with scope as multimeter it is difficult to catch the very short pulses."}
