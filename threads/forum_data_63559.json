Found bad <RESISTOR>R8178</RESISTOR> that was keeping <SIGNAL>3V3_S0</SIGNAL> missing, measured in the Megaohms (and possibly <TRANSISTOR>Q8131</TRANSISTOR>), replaced now get fan spin.  Found traces near SMC chewed through, jumpered them (<RESISTOR>R5193</RESISTOR> Test Point to SMC, and <CHIP>U3710</CHIP>'s Test Point to SMC).  I spent a reasonable amount of time making sure other traces near there were good, seems OK.  Have not lifted SMC, i'm running low on replacements but I will if need be.\n\nNo USB activity, though 5v is present.  No Video out through my display port adapter which usually works. No volts on <SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR</SIGNAL>, no shorts either.  <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0SW</SIGNAL> is 0v. PPBUS on BKL fuse 8.6 blah blah\n\nI've never delved into the logic part of this.  Is there any best practices.  My spi is fresh and beautiful. my SMC was potentially nasty. Possibly i lift and check traces."
