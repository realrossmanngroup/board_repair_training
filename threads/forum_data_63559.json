        "message":"Other tech ultrasonic'd this and it worked first try, video ok etc.\n\nCustomer came to get it and ofc it's not working.  Found bad R8178 that was keeping 3v3_s0 missing, measured in the Megaohms (and possibly Q8131), replaced now get fan spin.  Found traces near SMC chewed through, jumpered them (R5193 Test Point to SMC, and U3710's Test Point to SMC).  I spent a reasonable amount of time making sure other traces near there were good, seems OK.  Have not lifted SMC, i'm running low on replacements but I will if need be.\n\nNo USB activity, though 5v is present.  No Video out through my display port adapter which usually works. No volts on EDP_PANEL_PWR, no shorts either.  PP3V3_S0SW is 0v. PPBUS on BKL fuse 8.6 blah blah\n\nI've never delved into the logic part of this.  Is there any best practices.  My spi is fresh and beautiful. my SMC was potentially nasty. Possibly i lift and check traces."
