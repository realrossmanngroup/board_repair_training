I have some donor boards which I can take components off of.\n\nOne thing to note is plugging in the charger, even for 5 minutes, the board gets really hot which makes me believe I have a short somewhere.\n\nCan anyone please provide some tips as to where to start from so I can hopefully find the root of the problem?"
