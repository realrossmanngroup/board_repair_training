            "message": "This board had a short on PP3V33R3V0_AON. I replaced <CHIP>U4700</CHIP> and it worked fine for a couple days. The battery was on the low end - around 78% capacity and it was changing a fair amount going anywhere from 73% up to 81% as it charged and drained. I drained it all the way down and then after plugging in the power adapter it would just chime every few second randomly as if it was losing and then regaining connection to the adapter. After pulling the board I measured that <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_E85</SIGNAL> is cycling up and down. I can't find any shorts , PP3V33R3V0_AON is not shorted and am not finding any components heating up. Any idea what might have failed here?"
