That is now cleared and I get 3.3v on that line.\n\nThe board is missing <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5_LDO</SIGNAL> (not sure if they are supposed to be present at 5v)\n\nMy main concern is <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> as this is showing in diode mode 0.008 ( 8.3ohms) should be 0.040 but when i apply usb power i get 1.8v on <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL>\n\nI hooked up my USB-C analyser and this gave me a fault to pin 33 on J3300 so i replaced <CHIP>U3000</CHIP> and that's now cleared. No other faults reported with the USB-C analyser.\n\nI've tried DFU mode - failed\n\nSo i'm not sure if <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> is correct and why the reading is low.\n\nAll 4 ports are giving the same reading and there is no boot loop.\n\nAny help is appreciated."
