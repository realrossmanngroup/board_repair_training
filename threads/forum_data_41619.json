            "message": "hey guys\n\nSuprisingly very clean board. The one and ONLY problem i have spotted is one of the traces is corroded - deep. <SIGNAL>DP_T29SNK0_ML_N</SIGNAL> it connects to pin 2 of <CAPACITOR>C3623</CAPACITOR>.\nIf you look on the board view all the caps located in the same area are taking 3.3v on the pin 2.\n\nWould it be a problem if i borrow 3.3 from another cap and run a jumper? and is this where the potential issue may be or would you suspect there is some other underlying problem?\nthanks for your help."
