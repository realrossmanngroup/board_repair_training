The one and ONLY problem i have spotted is one of the traces is corroded - deep. DP_T29SNK0_ML_N it connects to pin 2 of C3623.\nIf you look on the board view all the caps located in the same area are taking 3.3v on the pin 2.\n\nWould it be a problem if i borrow 3.3 from another cap and run a jumper? and is this where the potential issue may be or would you suspect there is some other underlying problem?\nthanks for your help."}
