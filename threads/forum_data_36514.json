When I got it the screen rapidly flashes and after a minute screen goes completely blank. If I disconnect the LCD screen and connect Monitor output I get good video with NO blinking. I have already replaced with L8300 purchased from your store and it seems like the problem is somewhat fixed but now it will blink and the entire computer would turn off like its going into some deep sleep and then suddenly come back on. When I test that component that I replaced when this happens there is no voltage anywhere so definitely this board is going to sleep now. What do you recommend I replace now. I was thinking the [h=1]SL6259[/h]"

I saw evidence of flux on the connectors. I'm thinking maybe the screen is bad but I connected another screen and it does the same thing with another screen. I have to maybe trace the LCD circuit back and check each component. I really dont know how to test short to ground. I kind of understand it but Im still learning how to test components to see if they are short to ground."
