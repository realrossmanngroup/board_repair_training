Did ASD and its showing th1H SMC IO failed.\n\nChecked <CHIP>U5550</CHIP> and its good.\n\nResistance on <RESISTOR>R5550</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R5551</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R5552</RESISTOR> is also good. <RESISTOR>R5550</RESISTOR> seems to bounce around a lot but compared with another board and it seems to match up can you confirm that?  \n\nany ideas? should i be looking into the <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC</SIGNAL> line? \nWhen it powers on fan is normal and then at about a quarter way through the osx boot up fans slowly turn to full."
