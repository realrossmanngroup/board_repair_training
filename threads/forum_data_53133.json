            "message": "I had something I have never seen before and don't know why it failed. I wanted to share.\n\nThis board has a history of being intermittent. Came in for intermittent shutdown. I did notice some intermittent green light so I went and looked at <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> Noticed that I had 3.1v. After checking resistance to ground on L7905 I decided there is not a short or excessive load on this supply. Usually if I see a low voltage I jump to both sides of L7905 and if they are not the same I can see that the supply is heavily loaded. In this case high resistance to ground and no heavy load. After checking supply to <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> I determined that it was getting great power. I figured I either have a cap here or a bad <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>. I decided to go for the <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>. <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> fixed my problem Output went to a solid 3.42v\n\nJust wondered if anyone has seen this in a PP3V42 supply before?"
