        "message":"Hello,\nI apologize if this is not the right place to ask, but I didnt find which of the forum section (Macbook Logic Board Repair, Tools, Business talk, Off topic, iPhone, Diet...) was the most relevant for that.\n\nI will have to buy a few replacement keyboards (and Touchbar) for A1990 and A2141 MBP next week; how reliable are the replacements parts wrt original ? Any recommendation in terms of vendor? Given the time it takes, I don't want to have to replace the replacement keyboard...\n\nAlso, on store.rossmann, keyboard section, there is no replacement parts for A1990\/A2141. There are for A1706, but not after. Is there any specific reasons to this, such as unavailability or lack of reliability ?\n\nAlso, what kind of tool do you use to thread the new holes, so that the screws stay in place in the rivets' holes ?\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nKR\nS."
