Any recommendation in terms of vendor? Given the time it takes, I don't want to have to replace the replacement keyboard...\n\nAlso, on store.rossmann, keyboard section, there is no replacement parts for <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1990</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>/<MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A2141</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>. There are for <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, but not after. Is there any specific reasons to this, such as unavailability or lack of reliability ?\n\nAlso, what kind of tool do you use to thread the new holes, so that the screws stay in place in the rivets' holes ?\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nKR\nS."
