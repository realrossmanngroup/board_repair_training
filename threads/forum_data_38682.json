        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_S0_PGOOD": "What is PM_S0_PGOOD?  PM_S0_PGOOD is created when CPUVR_PGOOD and ALL_SYS_PWRGD are present and branches off to become PM_PCH_PWROK. PM_S0_PGOOD and SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD are necessary to create SYS_PWROK_R and PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK .",
