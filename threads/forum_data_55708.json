        "A1707": "What is A1707? A1707 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3072, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00281, 820-00928..",
        "U9800": "What is U9800? a CHIP.",
        "U7220": "What is U7220? a CHIP.",
        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "R9827": "What is R9827? a RESISTOR.",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",

        "PPVCCIO_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCIO_S0_CPU? PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is a power rail responsible for powering the part of the CPU responsible for communicating with other portions of the machine prior to PPVCORE_S0_CPU being present and must be present before vcore, PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is present when the machine is in an on, RUNNING state. .",

No shit on lcd connector and FPC: \n\n\nI checked and see that <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> is 0V so it's not enabling backlight , right? \n\n\nThis signal is generated by <CHIP>U9800</CHIP> checked and it's not generating 0V on <RESISTOR>R9827</RESISTOR>. \n\n\nThe problem is that it doesnt start even with external monitor. I dont know what this machines do when you connect external monitor and boot them. \n\n\nAlso it's strange that CPU is getting just warm and GPU stays cold. \n\n\nAny idea?"
