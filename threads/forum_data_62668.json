Now it chimes but that's it: no image, no external video but responds to PRAM-reset. Pulls full power on 87W charger now.\n\nNot a lot of experience with these. Any pointers?"

Charging with a lower spec charger shouldn't be a problem imo. \n\nEdit: looking for a replacement. Are there different 2m USB-C cables from Apple, or should the current one I got with my 87W charger just work with the bigger chargers?"
