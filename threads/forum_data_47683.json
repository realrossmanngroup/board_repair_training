The crash usually takes place towards the end of the boot process, but not specifically the same time every time. I have found if I disconnect KB/TP cable the OS will boot into the OS without crashing.

It will still  boot completely normal if TP/KB cable is unplugged. This time I replaced the SMC and repaired a small pad (93) as well. Issue also occurs in SMC bypass mode. I have replaced the connector and have checked values on <RESISTOR>R4850</RESISTOR>- 53 and <RESISTOR>R4860</RESISTOR>. The board is actually a 00165 (sorry about that, I dont know why I put 3437). \n\nThanks, sorry for the repeat issue."
