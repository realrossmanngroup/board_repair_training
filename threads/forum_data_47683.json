The crash usually takes place towards the end of the boot process, but not specifically the same time every time. I have found if I disconnect KB\/TP cable the OS will boot into the OS without crashing. I so far have tried new KB\/TP Cable, new TP, new KB and have replaced the KB\/TP connector as well.\n\nVisibly Affected areas-\n\nU1930\/ replaced\nC7601\/ replaced\nC5021\/ replaced\nL5001\/ replaced\nKB Connector\/ replaced\n\nMinor pad damage around SMC"}

The trackpad does attach to the PCH, so hopefully, that is not the issue. I would bet on crap under the SMC tho"}

It will still  boot completely normal if TP\/KB cable is unplugged. This time I replaced the SMC and repaired a small pad (93) as well. Issue also occurs in SMC bypass mode. I have replaced the connector and have checked values on R4850- 53 and r4860. The board is actually a 00165 (sorry about that, I dont know why I put 3437). \n\nThanks, sorry for the repeat issue."}
