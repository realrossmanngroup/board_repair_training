This seems to happen in shorter periods of time once the first initial crash happens if i keep rebooting. I have changed RAM and tried different slots. Also unplugged all peripheral besides LCD. No Liquid. Is this a known issue?\n\nThanks. Have a good one."}

Also common is the airport connector cable shorting out the pins on the connector if the piece of tape is missing. Also must use PC8500 RAM. If it is not any of this I doubt this is worth wasting time on."}
