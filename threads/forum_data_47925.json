Gave it an ultrasonic bath right away followed up with an alcohol bath, heat pad and left overnight.\n\n Reassembled it the next day. Boots up on charger only, however it does see the battery and charge light goes from green to orange.\n\n\n Battery Status shows Replace Battery, however it's @ %68.   So we see the battery, and it acts like it's charging it.  If I unplug the charger it shuts right off so safe to say it's not at all running on battery.\n\n I traced <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and have 8.57 @ all my points.\n\n <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> @ 3.41\n\n Had corrosion at these points :\n\n ( Top of Board )\n\n<CAPACITOR>C7797</CAPACITOR>, L7701, XW7720\n\nJ6100\n\n Above and just right of Shield SL0402 Near TP1GND\n\n ( Bottom of Board )\n\n\nGood amount between <CHIP>U5600</CHIP> and <CHIP>U5601</CHIP>\n\nAround <CAPACITOR>C5440</CAPACITOR> over the ground and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>\n\n\n\n Board cleaned up well, as I received it still wet.\n\nLooking for some direction to figure what I need to do next.\n\n I'll attach photos if it helps ?\n\n Thanks in advance !"
