This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely.

HI :).\n\nSo I have here this <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1708</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> that was given to me with the \"flashing folder\" issue, I give it the once over, It boots from an external drive but no sign of life from the SSD at all not recognised in disk utility or when booting into Parted magic, I presume SSD is dead and order a working second hand offical apple one from ebay. This arrives goes in no problem, IS seen by disk utility and installs macOS from internet recovery. I test the machine for a while and it seems perfect so I give it back to the customer. Only to have it back the next day with the exact same issue, Flashing folder and nothing can see the SSD, I now have 2 official apple SSD drives that are apparently dead!\n\nNext step was to order an MV.2 nvme converter and a compatible ssd, These turn up I install them no problem and they can be seen in disk utility and begin install of MacOS. This gets about 15 mins in and crashes , the machine just hangs, it was on the 4th attempt of installing that i noticed the heat from underneath the mac, Removing the base I find the M.2 drive is HOT, Like incredibly HOT - fry an egg on burn ur balls off hot! so I shut down the mac.\n\nI then try booting from the Samsung Nvme I have in my windows machine. and the mac boots right into windows no problem at all , But within minutes this SSD is once again so hot you could melt ur melons on it! so again I shut down\n\nGoing over and over the logic board I find no shorts or missing rails but i'm convinced something funky is going on with the SSD voltages or slot and its putting way to many V's into the SSD slot and nuking whatever is plugged in there.\n\n( Quick side note. I have it running next to me now booted from an external HDD , but the internal fan is not spinning and it does feel warm inside, is this normal for this board? the fan does work if I turn it on using Fan cntrl software installed on the external )\n\nI tried to check voltages at the SSD slot but it doesn't really say on the schematic what they should read at this point.\n\nAny help MASSVILY appreciated\n\n( Apologies if I have done or not done something I should or shouldn't have during this post, But it's my first here so go easy on me (y))\n\nThanks In advance!"
