What do you think yourself? I had so many issues with garbage flux. It is fine if you clean in 100%, but any residue will start to conduct after a few weeks.\n\nThis also means all rework that you did with this flux is now out there slowly corroding away. I had this exact problem 5 years ago with cheap ass China flux and had to do 100s of repairs all over again :("}

Not many issues with iMacs right now. Just sucks to get good GPUs. But GPUs failing in 1-2 weeks is pretty certain not a GPU problem. Even the reballed fake shit will last a few months."}
