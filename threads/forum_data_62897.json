            "message": "1707 -928 board I did a simple flex-gate. Customer returns with random crashing. I don't see random crashing. Crashes everytime right after login about 1/3 of way of loading.\nInspection I see no corrosion etc.\n\nI have tried: new screen, battery, trackpad\nI have replaced: <CHIP>U7410</CHIP>, 7210, 7420, 7230, 7220. \nAlso tried: QA640 & QA650\nTried to boot from USB\n\nAll of the above there is no change in symptoms. Remains the same. Boots fine, right after you login bar starts, loads 1/3 to 1/2 way and restarts with \"your mac shut down bc of a problem...\"\n\nHolding D at startup diagnostic says probably a bad fan. Ya right. LOL. They both work fine, not running on high. I've tried with things disconnected etc.\nI've tried blasting the CPU with air to keep it cool.\nGone in circles and lost of what else to do?"
