Using a boot USB, determined ports 3 and 4 are dead. Ports 1 and 2 closest to power plug function. Successfully booted OSX to safe mode. Rebooted, same freeze on boot.\n\nI am comfortable with some microsoldering. Is there a way I can get this mac to either function with all 4 ports, or cut ports 3-4 so the system operates?\n\nS\/N  C02QL2BJGG78"
