I'm going to evaluate the seating / cable connectors, etc, but in your guys' experience does this seem like an issue with the screen, the connector or the logic board video circuitry? Would it be worth buying an adapter to check the display on an external screen?[/B]\n\n\n[B]**When pressure is applied to the bottom left of the front of the screen, the number of tiny thin lines changes and they kind of change and jump around a bit.**[/B]\n\n\n[B]Basically, if it seems like the actual screen is the issue, I'm just going to sell this off broken. I do not want to open up screens it is too much of a pain imo. If it's advisable, I'd be willing to try heat application or pressure or something that does not involve taking the screen apart.[/B]\n\n\n[B]Thanks a bunch![/B][/FONT][/SIZE]"
