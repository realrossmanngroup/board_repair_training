Fans spin up normal for around 10 seconds. then the fans do a burst and the Macbook restarts.\nIt had minior liquid damage near j5100, u5104, . I have already tried:\n\n- Disconnecting everything except battery. (since it doesn't boot without it) and one usb-c port adapter.\n\nMy guess is, that it is a temp. sensor. (maybe the one in the battery ?)\n\nWhat do you guys think?"}
