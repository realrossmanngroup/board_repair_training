        "message":"Hi, I have a 820-4924 that I'm working on. The board itself looks clean no signs of liquid damage. I have no power green light and missing PM_SLP_S5.\nPM_SLP_S5 = goes up to 1.4v for a split second while Magsafe is initially plugged in. I do know that PM_SLP_S5 creates my EN for S4 but I'm not sure how to hunt this down. PM_PWRBTN_L goes low when pressing the power button. I tried a SMC bypass and still no power. I've attached some readings of what I have so far. If there is anything else you need to push me in the right direction please let me know, I appreciate it.
