I see it's taking from 0.11 to 1.06 amp when I press the power button. So I tried to put it in DFU, that works. I tried \"revive\" but it failed with  \"the operation couldn't be completed (AMRetoreErrrorDomain error 6 - Failed to handle message type StatusMsg (Operation failed) ... Is it worth try with Apple GSX server ?"
