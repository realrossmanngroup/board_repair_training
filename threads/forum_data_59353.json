I am dealing with <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B board today which had extensive water damage.\n\nAfter replacing couple caps and fixing traces around G3H it turns on, but it takes it 3 cycles to become stable and load into system, on bare board without any intervention after i attach the charger.\n\nThis happens every time i feed power: Turns on 0.4 - 0.6A draw for 2-6sec with no light on screen or matrix. Drops to 0.1A for couple secs. Then 0.4-0.6 again for couple secs and drops to 0.1A\nThird time fires up and loads into system. After couple times looping like that switches off with 0.03A draw.\n\nAfter third cycle, stays stable as usual system and can run for hours.\n\nBetween all these cycles no intervention by me.\n\nS0 voltages fine.\n\nNot sure what power sections to post.\n\nThanks in advance"
