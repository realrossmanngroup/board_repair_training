Gets all power rails except <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is only 0.86 instead of the 1.25V noted in the schematic. After noticing this I found that the capacitors on the PPVCORE rail right above the PCH are all shorted to ground. I have removed <TRANSISTOR>Q7510</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7520</TRANSISTOR> and the short is stil present, should I just start popping of caps until the short goes away, or is it most likely a shorted CPU?"
