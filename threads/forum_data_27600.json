Gets all power rails except PPVCORE_S0_CPU is only 0.86 instead of the 1.25V noted in the schematic. After noticing this I found that the capacitors on the PPVCORE rail right above the PCH are all shorted to ground. I have removed Q7510 and Q7520 and the short is stil present, should I just start popping of caps until the short goes away, or is it most likely a shorted CPU?"}
