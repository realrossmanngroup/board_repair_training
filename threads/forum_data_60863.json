Someone took it apart before, stripped screws, stripped screw holes and metal shavings on the board.\nNosigns of any rework done on it. \n\nSigns of liquid damage, tiny spots of corrosion, darkened caps below <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>(<CAPACITOR>C7016</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7028</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7012</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7017</CAPACITOR>)\n<CAPACITOR>C9300</CAPACITOR> below <CHIP>U3700</CHIP> looks dark/corroded - it's for <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> -> ground. But its not shorted, nothing is shorted.\n\nI want to ask for opinion before I start looking for replacement caps. No clue if that might be the problem.\n\nI took off and reballed <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> because I noticed signs of liquid being under the chips at some point.\n\nI went through every single power rail. \nOnly these are not correct values - rest (every single one)just goes to specified value and drops down to zero. Nothing stays on permanently.\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3R2V7_NAND_VCC</SIGNAL> - 2.8V (3.3V in schematics)\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> - 1.32V - 0.74V (1.8V)\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_GT</SIGNAL> - 0.0V (1.8V) (3.9 Ohm - from what I understand CPU rails are always low resistance)\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_SUS_PCH</SIGNAL> - 1V (1.8V)\n\nThank in advance"
