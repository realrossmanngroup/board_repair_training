        "C7771": "What is C7771? Tantalum capacitor on 820-2330 and 820-2532 logic boards that often dies and causes PP1V05_S5_MCP or PP1V05_S5 to be 0.331v instead of 1.05v. If heating this cap restores voltage to this rail, replace.",

        "5V_S3": "What is 5V_S3? 5V_S3 is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S3” which is a 5 volt power rail present in an S3 state. S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. ."

I put some voltage in this line, the <CHIP>U6610</CHIP> heat replaced for new on, but short don't goes on and i replace <TRANSISTOR>Q7225</TRANSISTOR> and short gone it's ok.. But when i plug the charge the short comes again!! any help??\n\nThank you"
