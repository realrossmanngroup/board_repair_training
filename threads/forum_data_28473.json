I put some voltage in this line, the U6610 heat replaced for new on, but short don't goes on and i replace q7225 and short gone it's ok.. But when i plug the charge the short comes again!! any help??\n\nThank you"}

There was a voltage spike on 5V_S3 and this could have killed many other things. Compare resistance to GND on 5V_S3 to a good board and replace U7201.\nYou are using a REAL 85W charger and shorting the power pads to turn it on? 3V3_S5 present?"}
