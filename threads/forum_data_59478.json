I saw fan spin and got excited, thinking I found my issue. \nI checked all the voltages going to the line, per your suggestion, with a closer eye this time, and noticed that <SIGNAL>PP1V2_S3</SIGNAL> was 1v08 instead of the expected 1v2 (Initially thinking this was in the margin of error). So After checking the resistor <RESISTOR>R7450</RESISTOR> to make sure it was in spec, I decided to change <TRANSISTOR>Q7430</TRANSISTOR>. Once I did that, I got the 1v2 I was expecting, and board fixed. Thanks again for your help"
