        "message":"Hi\n\nI am having an odd issue with this board. It works perfectly when installed the case and oriented vertically, but when oriented horizontal...the fans kick in to high gear and these three sensors are tripped: \n\nMemory Module 1\nHeatpipe Incoming Air\nHeatpipe Outgoing Air.\n\nThe board is immaculate and no previous repairs have been done. I checked all these sensors and even replaced them with no fix. Ia lso replaced U5511. There are no shorts to ground on any of these sensor lines. I have also tried putting pressure on different components (such as SMC) and sections of the board while powered up with no success. I also thought perhaps it was the SMS sensor so I also replaced that as well. The only way this unit will operate normally is when the case is up (vertical) and the screen is laying on a surface.\n\nThis issue started at random only after removing the lower cover."
