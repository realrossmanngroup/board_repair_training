Something happened while working on board that caused PPBUS G3H to drop to 1.4V. I discovered that appeared to be a short but was issue with <CHIP>U8930</CHIP> that mustve been shorting PPVIN <SIGNAL>S5_HS_GPU</SIGNAL> to GFXIMVP phase line.\n\nI tried bypassing the GPU thinking this would solve the board not booting but no change."
