It starts up and works normally but AHT brings up the error PFM006 (\"There may be an issue with the SMC\").\n\nI know the SMC is integrated into the T2 on these models, so I performed a DFU Restore, which did not change the situation. I also tried a different battery (no change). I tried unplugging the trackpad\/keyboard before running AHT (no change)."}

When I replaced the trackpad again, the SMC error disappeared. Turns out the initial replacement trackpad was bad."}
