        "message":"Got a unit in that had liquid-damage, but the board had no liquid damage. There were scattered spots of residue, but no corrosion\/burning and no critical areas affected. Battery, keyboard and trackpad were all damaged.\n\nThe issue with this board is that it will not work from suspend\/hibernate ONLY. It wakes from sleep just fine, but when it hits hibernate, it won't wake. When lid is opened, trackpad functions and the backlight comes on, but no video\/data. Board also works fine under load and does not suffer from common CPU\/vcore issue. I don't think this issue is the same as that one, because the fans don't spin full-speed and it only happens when the unit is coming out of hibernate\/suspend. All other cases I've seen with the vcore issue had other additional symptoms. Also, customer reported the unit worked perfectly fine (no issues) prior to the liquid spill. The trackpad was damaged in such a way that it caused the unit to cut off during boot, if this is helpful. Battery was damaged in such a way that it was detected but would not charge and would not power unit.\n\nAny insight as to where to look on this one would be very helpful and much appreciated! Thank you!"
