            "message": "Hi guys i have a macbook pro early 2011 that keeps rebooting. It has been repaired before as I resoldered the legs of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C7513</CAPACITOR> has been resoldered. Board looks pretty OK though. Now it can run both ASD test EFI and OS and passes without issue, it also never reboots. Trying to boot any OS version from an external drive, it reboots, shows Apple logo and restarts after a few seconds. Same when I try to run Linux from a USB drive. Anything I should check here? I do have a green and orange light on the charger."
