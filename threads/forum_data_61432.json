            "message": "Hello. I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that had minor corrosion on a bunch of areas of the board, mostly on the back side around the edges. I cleaned the corroded areas and replaced a few resistors and caps along the way. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> was shorted to ground and I found the short was caused by either <CAPACITOR>C6452</CAPACITOR> or <CAPACITOR>C6466</CAPACITOR>. I replaced both of these caps and the short was gone. When I plugged in the charger, it takes 20v 0.06amps and does not turn on. I had steady 12.6v on PPBUS now and all voltages up until <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, which was missing. I attempted a DFU restore and it completed successfully, without error and now I am getting all voltages except for CPU vcore it seems. When I plug it in now, it goes up to about 400ma before going back down to 80ma. <SIGNAL>PVCCIO_PGOOD</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> are both fluctuating between 1.3v and 1.5v, which I now is a little low. I assume that means there may be an issue with <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>, but wanted to get a second opinion."

I came back to it this morning and it was giving me 20v 300ma and the right side of the board was getting hot. Now both <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SSD0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP0V9_SSD0</SIGNAL> are shorted to ground, even after removing <CHIP>U9500</CHIP>, so I believe the SSD is shorted. Really weird because there was no corrosion in this area."
