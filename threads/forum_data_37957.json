(pins 1-3 12.60, pin 4 12.56)\n<RESISTOR>R7150</RESISTOR> due to liquid along with <CAPACITOR>C7145</CAPACITOR>\n<CAPACITOR>C7155</CAPACITOR>\n<CAPACITOR>C7156</CAPACITOR>\n<CAPACITOR>C7157</CAPACITOR>\n\nResistance on pins 17/18 of ISL are: 3.3 ohms (seems high?)\nResistance on pins 27/28 of ISL are: 21.2 ohms\n\nCertainly confused now - any ideas?"
