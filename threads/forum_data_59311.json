        "A1534": "What is A1534? A1534 is a model number for a 12 inch size Macbook  from years 2015, 2016 with EMC 2746, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00045, 820-00244..",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "SPI_CLK": "What is SPI_CLK? a SIGNAL.",
        "SPI_MOSI": "What is SPI_MOSI? SPI_MOSI is a signal between the CPU or PCH and the SPI ROM bios chip that is necessary for the machine to POST and boot. If this signal line is corroded or the BIOS chip has failed then you will not get PM_SLP_S4_L and the machine will not boot. Very often this line is corroded by liquid damage. .",

Noticeably it gets [I]very[/I] hot compared to a good board/laptop when left alone.\n\nNothing visible on the board, looks clean. All powers rails are present and <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is good. <SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_LED</SIGNAL> is also present. <SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is 0.795V which is about the same, if a tad higher than a known good board.\n\nI turned to looking at the SPI. When measuring with a multimeter (don't have an oscilloscope at the moment for this) on a known good board I see <SIGNAL>SPI_CLK</SIGNAL> oscillate for around 10 seconds after power input and see similar on <SIGNAL>SPI_MOSI</SIGNAL> however I don't see that on this board, it's static at 0V. Conscious I might be missing something in the 2-3 seconds after power input before the multimeter probes touch the board though.\n\nChecked for short on <SIGNAL>SPI_CLK</SIGNAL> using diode mode, measured 1.58V vs 1.62V on a known good board.\n\nUnsure where to look next."
