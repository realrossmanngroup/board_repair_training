    "definitions": {
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "U3510": "What is U3510? a CHIP.",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PM_BATLOW_L": "What is PM_BATLOW_L? PM_BATLOW_L is a signal that tells the system the battery is too low for it to turn on & keeps it from turning on, when it is low. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "SMC_ADAPTER_EN": "What is SMC_ADAPTER_EN? SMC_ADAPTER_EN enables the machine to work off of the power adapter when the proper power adapter is attached. Attacching an 85w Macbook Pro 15” power adapter to a 13” Macbook that requires a 60w power adapter is ok, attaching a 45w Macbook Air power adapter to a 15” macbook Pro that needs an 85w power adapter will result in SMC_ADAPTER_EN missing. .",
        "P3V3SUS_EN": "What is P3V3SUS_EN? P3V3SUS_EN is a signal that turns on the PP3V3_SUS power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high..",
        "P3V3_S5": "What is P3V3_S5? a SIGNAL.",
        "P3V3_SUS": "What is P3V3_SUS? a SIGNAL.",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "R7551": "What is R7551? a RESISTOR.",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "5V_S5": "What is 5V_S5? 5V_S5 is an abbreviation for “PP5V_S5” which is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 state. ."

Rest of the boards looks clean, now we changed the SMC 3 x (no stock left:() but still get 8.17. I do get <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> on <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>? Is there something else that can pull down the SMC power to 8.17v? I did get a spinning fan (blow hard) at some point but after we replaced the 3rd SMC nothing. Missing <SIGNAL>P3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> as well as <SIGNAL>P3V3SUS_EN</SIGNAL>, i do have <SIGNAL>P3V3_S5</SIGNAL>.\n\n\nAnother question, is the SMC for 3437 compatible with 00165?\n\nSome more readings:\n\nI have 32 on clock chip\n<CHIP>U1950</CHIP> gets 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL> = 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER_EN</SIGNAL> = 3.4v\n<SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> = 0v\n\nEdit: just changed the 4th SMC from a board with a 100% working one (short in memory power line), same, 8.17v but on previous board 8.6"
