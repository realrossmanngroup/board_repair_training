        "message":"Hello, we have this 00165 that 8.17v, it had corrosion on U3510. After replacing, still 8.18. Rest of the boards looks clean, now we changed the SMC 3 x (no stock left:() but still get 8.17. I do get SMC_PM_G2_EN on U7501? Is there something else that can pull down the SMC power to 8.17v? I did get a spinning fan (blow hard) at some point but after we replaced the 3rd SMC nothing. Missing P3v3_SUS as well as P3V3SUS_EN, i do have P3v3_S5.\n\n\nAnother question, is the SMC for 3437 compatible with 00165?\n\nSome more readings:\n\nI have 32 on clock chip\nU1950 gets 3.4v\nPM_BATLOW_L = 3.3v\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN = 3.4v\nALL_SYS_PWRGD = 0v\n\nEdit: just changed the 4th SMC from a board with a 100% working one (short in memory power line), same, 8.17v but on previous board 8.6"
