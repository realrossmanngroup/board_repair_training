Customer went to Apple Store to mount HDD and then called me the same day because macbook doesn't turn on.\nI received macbook back:\n\nNo visible damage on the board, if I try to turn it on multiple times plugging magsafe to board, sometimes it turns on and I get video on lcd, after 20 second it shut down.\nI thinks there are no short in power rails because sometimes it turn on. Could be SMC o <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> or gpu? what can cause shut down after 20 seconds?"
