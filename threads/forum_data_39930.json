Board is not liquid damaged, and dont see any physical damage. PPBUS_G3H is dead short, when I inject votage the board heats up right around the corner of the CPU, but it really seems like the heat is coming from inside the board. I dont really have high hopes for this one, but thought I would ask. I have used IPA and freeze spray as well, and the heat dissipates in the same fassion as it looks on"}

Those are the correct values 100%. Someone else suggested that the machine was probably dropped forcing the heat sink pillar into the board shorting out the trace. Thats exactly what it looked like to me. I didnt consider that pillar at first, but it makes perfect sense. Thanks for taking the time to help."}
