After inspecting it through the MS I saw that <RESISTOR>R1623</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1451</RESISTOR>, <RESISTOR>R1583</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R1462</RESISTOR> were toast so had to replace and run a couple wires. Board is drawing 30 mA and not turning on. After testing all the power aliases page I am missing my S0 enables which looks like I need <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL>, but I do not have, I have <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>. not sure where to check next. I checked if I have a short on my missing S0 rails but didn't find anything. could use a hand with this one."
