They foolishly bought it broken from ebay thinking they could save money and have me fix it. After inspecting it through the MS I saw that R1623, R1451, R1583 & R1462 were toast so had to replace and run a couple wires. Board is drawing 30 mA and not turning on. After testing all the power aliases page I am missing my S0 enables which looks like I need PM_SLP_S3_L, but I do not have, I have PM_SLP_S4_L. not sure where to check next. I checked if I have a short on my missing S0 rails but didn't find anything. could use a hand with this one."}
