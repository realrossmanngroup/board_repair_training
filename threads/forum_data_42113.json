        "R6990": "What is R6990? Resistor between charger voltage and input to PP3V42_G3H power supply on Macbooks from around the year 2012. This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

If it's still short, inject 3.3 volts into that line. There should absolutely be current draw on a low resistance short might be hard to find it. You can increase amperage to 4 or 5 amps if you power supply allows it."
