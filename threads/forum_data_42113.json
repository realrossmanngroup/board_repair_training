If it's still short, inject 3.3 volts into that line. There should absolutely be current draw on a low resistance short might be hard to find it. You can increase amperage to 4 or 5 amps if you power supply allows it."}

Replaced d6990 but no change r6990 is at proper resistance no change.\n\nremoved smc but i still get fluctuation. bad pch?\n\nany further ideas?"}
