I don't have a scope though.\nBattery detection is working.\n\nAny ideas or places to start?\n\nThanks much,\n\nStefan"}

Chinese replacement batteries usually leave the controller in non-sealed state which will not affect anything. It does make it possible to simply reset cycle counter and full charge capacity etc. if you wish to do so. Sealed batteries require a password to access these values in the controller."}
