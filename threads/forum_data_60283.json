Since this is not a T2 chip version I dont think its a software issue. The machine takes no charge 5.12v, no amp on all ports. I measure as follows:\n\nPP20V on <CAPACITOR>C3201</CAPACITOR>: 5V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_UPC</SIGNAL> on <CAPACITOR>C3208</CAPACITOR>: 3.3v \n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> on <CAPACITOR>C3200</CAPACITOR>: 0v (no short)\nPPBUS: 0.014v (no short)\n\nNext I checked <CHIP>U6903</CHIP>\nL6900: 0V (no short)\nPPVIN <CAPACITOR>C6906</CAPACITOR>: 1.33 (no short)\nEnable signal: 2.22v (Assume this means <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> is OK?)\n\nNext I checked <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>:\nall resistor measure OK and looks very clean\nI have tried to replace it, as a lucky shot but all values remain the same as above.\n\nI cannot find any short on all big coils as well. Suggestions as what to check next, or if I forgot something in my work flow above?"
