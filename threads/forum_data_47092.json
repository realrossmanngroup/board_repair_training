Are there other issues that could cause this failure and not the ram.\n\nCustomer claims it originally had issues with the track pad, so he\/she replaced it with another trackpad which is when the beep started. They Reinstalled the original trackpad with the same beep code. I hooked up the medusa and it says the VSS PRAM block not found. Could this be the issue, that its just a corrupted bios chip? \n\nFYI: fan does spin."}
