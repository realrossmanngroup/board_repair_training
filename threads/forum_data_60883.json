        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "SMC_LSOC_RST_L": "What is SMC_LSOC_RST_L? SMC_LSOC_RST_L is a signal that comes out of the trackpad on Macbook Airs that can reset the SMC.  _L means whatever before the _L in the signal name is asserted when it is low voltage, such as 0.0v to 0.5v..",
        "PP3V3_S4_IPD": "What is PP3V3_S4_IPD? PP3V3_S4_IPD is a 3.3v power rail for powering the trackpad and keyboard on a Macbook Air. If the keyboard and trackpad are not powering, check the resistor that functions as a fuse between PP3V3_S4 and PP3V3_S4_IPD as it may have blown. .",
