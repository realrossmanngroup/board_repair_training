I replaced the chip and the laptop worked great for a few days. Then it stopped working. Theres light on the charger but no fan spin, CPU gets hot. \n\nPPBUS_G3H,  PP5V_S5,  PP3V3_S5, PP5V_S0,  PP3V3_S0 and  PP1V5_S0  are all present. CPU Vcore is 1.8v. \n\nWhen i resoldered U6100 to rule out a bad solder point, i noticed that when the board is still hot theres fan spin. After it cools out the fan wont spin anymore. I tried heating  U1600 only with the iron but the fan didnt spin."}

Turns out the board was fine, I didn't know about the fan not turning on unless it was hot, so I thought it was not posting."}
