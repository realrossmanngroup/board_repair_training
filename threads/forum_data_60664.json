I replaced the chip and the laptop worked great for a few days. Then it stopped working. Theres light on the charger but no fan spin, CPU gets hot. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>,  <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL>,  <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>,  <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL> and  <SIGNAL>PP1V5_S0</SIGNAL>  are all present. CPU Vcore is 1.8v. \n\nWhen i resoldered <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> to rule out a bad solder point, i noticed that when the board is still hot theres fan spin. After it cools out the fan wont spin anymore. I tried heating  <CHIP>U1600</CHIP> only with the iron but the fan didnt spin."
