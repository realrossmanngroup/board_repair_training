When Charger plugged in these lines are both 3.3v\nPIN 55 of U3200 (TSP_USP_XB_SWD_CLK) Test point burnt off board. Line reads 3.3v when charger is plugged in\n\nPP3v3_G3H is 3.368v\nPPBUS_G3H is 5v and cycles 0-5v every few seconds as if there is some type of reset. \n\nU3100 and U3200 were clean when pulled and no burnt pads under the chip or corrosion. Reballed and reinstalled and no change.\nI am ordering new ICs but was wondering if Im missing something else since the chips had no signs of liquid under them."}
