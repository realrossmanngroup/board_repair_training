I have a bunch of other asd's on flash drives but was missing 3s146 for some reason. Has Catalina restricted installing asd on flash drives or am I missing a step? I keep trying to restore the partition with disk utility on a flash drive, 3S146 but i get \"could not validate sizes - operation not permitted. the operation couldn't be completed. )OSStatus error 1)"}
