Original damaged battery says \"battery need replacement\". So I order replacement and just received. I dont think it is original battery.\n\nMacbook doesnt charge or sense new battery at all. \n\nI already ask question on how to test the battery (answer was cant).\n\nCan I test motherboard some how? \nSYS_DETECT_L on battery connector keep going from 0.010v to 0.500v with new battery.  SMBUS_BATT has 3v , and PPVBAT_G3H_CONN jumps to 3.5v and then goes down\n\n\nWhat can I check to make sure I just have a bad battery or something else?"}

Also check if PPBUS is still at 12.56V and not 12.3V"}
