Original damaged battery says \"battery need replacement\". So I order replacement and just received. I dont think it is original battery.\n\nMacbook doesnt charge or sense new battery at all. \n\nI already ask question on how to test the battery (answer was cant).\n\nCan I test motherboard some how? \n<SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_L</SIGNAL> on battery connector keep going from 0.010v to 0.500v with new battery.  <SIGNAL>SMBUS_BATT</SIGNAL> has 3v , and <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CONN</SIGNAL> jumps to 3.5v and then goes down\n\n\nWhat can I check to make sure I just have a bad battery or something else?"
