Replaced components but in the middle of replacing cd3215 some minor pad damage happened on board see picture. Every time cd3215 is soldered amp meter cycles from balls bridging.\n\nWhat is the best way to fix this? Does uv mask work if you apply in between the pads to prevent bridging? I have tried minor scraping in the area but the balls still bridge"}
