Replaced components but in the middle of replacing <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> some minor pad damage happened on board see picture. Every time <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> is soldered amp meter cycles from balls bridging.\n\nWhat is the best way to fix this? Does uv mask work if you apply in between the pads to prevent bridging? I have tried minor scraping in the area but the balls still bridge"
