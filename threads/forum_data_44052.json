It seems that the screen is very slow., also on the left side and top, there are some lines as well.\nWhen I turn it on in safe mode it works normally only with those lines on the left and top \nI think that laptop has some point on the top left corner of the screen like it was dropped, but it's very small.\nWhen I share the screen with other computers on it its normal.\nWhat kind of problem is that, is this screen, GPU or what? How can I investigate that?\n\nThanks in advance"}
