        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "A1502": "What is A1502? A1502 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2014, Late 2013, Early 2015 with EMC 2875, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-3476, 820-3536, 820-4924..",
        "U7501": "What is U7501? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V3_S5,  PP3V3_S3,  PP3V3_S0,  PP5V_S5,  PP5V_S4,  PP5V_S0.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "P5VS4RS3_EN": "What is P5VS4RS3_EN? PP5VS4RS3_EN is a signal that enables the PP5V_S4RS3 power rail. When you see _EN in front of a signal name, it means that it is enabling whatever comes before the _EN when the signal is high..",
        "S5_PWR_EN": "What is S5_PWR_EN? S5_PWR_EN is a signal that turns on all S5 power rails when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",
        "PPBUS_3GH": "What is PPBUS_3GH? PPBUS_3GH is a typo of PPBUS_G3H. If you see someone type PPBUS_3GH assume they meant to type PPBUS_G3H.",
        "C1910": "What is C1910? a CAPACITOR.",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015.",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",
        "ADAPTER_SENSE": "What is ADAPTER_SENSE? This is a line between the onewire circuit and the magsafe charger where the magsafe charger can talk to the SMC(system management controller) on the SYS_ONEWIRE line.."
