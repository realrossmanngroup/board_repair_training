Does SMC_PM_G2_EN need to be present before S5_PWR_EN?.\n\nEDIT: I went through the power rails one more time. I am now getting a short to ground on PPVRTC_G3H and PP3V3_S5, Also it seems as if someone attempted board repair prior to me receiving it, C1910 is gone, looks like it was scratched off when trying to probe."}
