After replacing the backlight is back but shows the grey shades in the right bottom. With iphone this is often caused by a bad coil but for Macs I dont know. The coil looks great, and, its never the coil right:)? Everything on the display connector side looks very nice, only liquid was under U7701.\n\nGreetz\nArno"}

One or more will be open circuit. Either bad trace\/resistor or crap soldering on LP8550."}

WIll try to resolder and see how that goes, thanks!"}
