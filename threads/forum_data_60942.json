I also have multiple sensors reported 128 deg C. I was not able to create working ASD for my early 2015 Mac. Most probably I will not solve the problem but fix it with diodes in control of the fan to reduce voltage (—i.e. speed) and removing dual mosfet that triggers cpu prochot signal. Doggy fix as master Sorin would call it.\n\niclub, did you try removing <CHIP>U5810</CHIP> from the board and testing without it? I have seen boards with 90 days warranty sold on ebay without <CHIP>U5810</CHIP>."
