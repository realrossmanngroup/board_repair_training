MagSafe takes a few seconds after power-on to light green, never changes to amber, and intermittently turns off altogether.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is a steady 12.29V with no battery attached.\nU7000 was replaced.  No change.\nU7000 resistance on pins 17\/18 is 3.2 Ohms and pins 27\/28 is 20 Ohms.\nR7005 resistance is 20 Ohms.\nSteady CHGR_ACOK signal, even when MagSafe is not lit.\nQ7030\/35 both replaced.  No change.\nR5280 and R5281 resistance both measure 2 kOhms.\nOn SMC_DCIN_VSENSE; R5498 resistance 27.3 kOhms, R5499 is 5.49 kOhms.\nOn SMC_PBUS_VSENSE; R5488 resistance 23.3 kOhms, R5489 is 5.47 kOhms.  C5489 not shorted.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n*Update:  Booted the machine and appears that it doesn't see the battery.  R7051 measures 2.5 Ohms, R7052 is 0.4 Ohms."}
