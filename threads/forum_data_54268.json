        "C6990": "What is C6990? Capacitor to ground on input to PP3V42_G3H power supply. PP3V42_G3H power supply turns 18.5v from charger or 8.5v-12.5v PPBUS_G3H from the battery into PP3V42_G3H. This capacitor can short to ground and keep PP3V42_G3H from turning on which would keep the machine from having a light on the magsafe charger.",
