        "message":"Hi, \n\nGot 820-3332-a that cutomer changed U8900. No liquid damage, as he says just display randomly was shutting down. Changed U8900 again with new one  ( it wasnt soldered good). The machine still not turning on. Green light ok. PPBUS_G3H 2.2V and almost shorted to ground with 11ohms ground resistance. \n\n\nWith magsafe contected U8000 is getting warm enough. Already checked ISL 625 and 17\/18 and 27\/28 resistance seems to be ok. Also resistance in that area. \n\nI guess that when was changind U8900 first time heated up too much and fucked GPU. CHecking in that area doesnt see anything strange. \n\nAny idea?"
