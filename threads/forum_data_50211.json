No liquid damage, as he says just display randomly was shutting down. Changed <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> again with new one  ( it wasnt soldered good). The machine still not turning on. Green light ok. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 2.2V and almost shorted to ground with 11ohms ground resistance. \n\n\nWith magsafe contected <CHIP>U8000</CHIP> is getting warm enough. Already checked ISL 625 and 17/18 and 27/28 resistance seems to be ok. Also resistance in that area. \n\nI guess that when was changind <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> first time heated up too much and fucked GPU. CHecking in that area doesnt see anything strange. \n\nAny idea?"
