The issue I'm having is the battery will not charge. Computer runs fine on wall adapter and the computer sees the battery. I tried another battery with the same result. I'm a bit new at this but catch on fast. I already have the board view for this board and have started troubleshooting.[/FONT][/B]\n\n[B]<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 8.4v so I assume <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> is the issue. Is there a way for me to test <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR>? Anything else I should be checking?\n\nAdditionally I am using coconutBattery to see the Charging info. When I first attach the charger it shows charging at 10 watts then gradually drops to 0 watts.\n\nAny help would be great.\n\nThanks[/B]"
