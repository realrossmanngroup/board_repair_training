        "message":"Arrived with no liquid damage with PPBUS_G3H shorted. U1100 was shorted. Replaced U1100, PPBUS_G3H was no longer shorted and had boot current over 2 amps for a few seconds before C8010 burned and smoked. Replaced but now board is at 20v 0 amp draw. PPBUS_G3H was shorted again from shorted u7900. Replaced U7900 PPBUS short gone again but still 20v 0 amps. ALL_SYS_PWRGD  and PM_RSMRST_L 0V. SMC_PM_G2_EN 3.3V so replaced U7800 but no change\n\nAlready cleaned ME region from PCH replacement.\n\nWhat should be checked next?"
