        "message":"Got this one in saying no display. After reseating the battery the machine started. Ran for 24 hours. Next day it has shut off. I tried to start it again but now it is not booting. It has no liquid.\n\nSymptoms are fan spins then stops then spins faster and faster.\n\nVCORE is ok at 1.8V all the time\n\nOn first fan spin all pins on U6100 coming up. But when fan stops pin5 (SPI_MLB_IO0_MOSI) and pin6 (SPI_MLB_CLK) goes to 0V and don't come back on high when fans starts to spin again.\n\nWhere to start ??\n\nThanks"
