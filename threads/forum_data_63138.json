After that computer turns on and works normally but time to time screen goes black by itself and not turning back on. The same when I close the lid and open it, backlight won’t appear, but computer is working. What I have done so far:\n[LIST]\n[*]Tried new Audio board with new flex cable\n[*]Tried new right speaker with LID sensor\n[*]Tried new mic/ LID sensor cable which goes under left speaker\n[*]Tried new trackpad and trackpad flex cable\n[*]Tried new LCD assembly\n[*]Tried with keyboard disconnected\n[/LIST]\n<CHIP>U4850</CHIP> / <CHIP>U4802</CHIP> areas were inspected -  no damages found there, resistors around have correct values, there is continuity between all resistors in that circuit.\n\nI’m on my leave now and don’t have board around, so I will write aproximate measurements which I remember, but they aren’t 100% correct. Tomorrow I’ll be in the office and update if necessary\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID_LEFT</SIGNAL> reads ~0,350V (diode mode)\n<SIGNAL>SMC_LID_RIGHT</SIGNAL> reads ~0,350V (diode mode)\n\nWhen lid is open <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_LEFT</SIGNAL> is 1,8V but <SIGNAL>SMC_LID_RIGHT</SIGNAL> is 0,9V and the backlight is present. Wen I close the lid both are 0V, and after opening they read 1,8 and 0,9V again but there is no backlight on the screen.\n\nIf I put computer to sleep mode from the system without closing the lid computer wakes up with backlight after pressing any button on keyboard. But if I will close the lid and open it up in some time computer wakes up without backlight."
