If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. ."

When I plug in an external KB it will respond to me hold option to see the EFI padlock, but any other key combos I get nothing. I hooked and External drive to it and can see usb activity, I also have a couple other <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2530</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> boards that I put in to the case and the KB works. Would it be safe to assume <CHIP>U5701</CHIP> is bad? I checked the pins up close on the KB connector and they appear solid. I just find it weird that even on an external KB it does not respond."
