        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "U5800": "What is U5800? a CHIP.",
        "U8005": "What is U8005? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PPVRTC_G3H": "What is PPVRTC_G3H? PPVRTC_G3H is a 3.3v power rail for the RTC circuit present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state. .",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

        "PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL? This is the voltage coming directly from the charger after going through a transistor. .",
        "PP5V_SO": "What is PP5V_SO? PP5V_SO is a typo of PP5V_S0, which is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S0 working state. The person who typed PP5V_SO thought that the S0 in PP5V_S0 was SO, if you see PP5V_SO assume the user made a typo and meant to type PP5V_S0.",
