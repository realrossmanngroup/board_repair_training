        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",

        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",

This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "SYS_ONEWIRE": "What is SYS_ONEWIRE? This is a bidirectional communication line between the system management controller(SMC) and the charger that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC. This must be working for the light to come on on the magsafe charger. .",

After cleaning up some corroded caps around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> it will boot from the battery and work fine.  It will not boot or charge.  Do I have bad I/O board?\nComing off the DC board I have 3.14v but when I connect it to the MB at J7000 I get a fluctuating voltage from 4v to 8v on pin 1.  Should I have more voltage coming from the I/O board.    I've tested every capacitor on the <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> for short but can't find one."

Well all I can say is that I was having an issue with <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and that the computer would work on battery and not Charger so looks like I'll be looking into those two things above.  If anyone has some info to share please do."
