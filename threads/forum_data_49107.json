        "message":"Hello guys,\n\nI hope someone can help me with this. \n\nA MacBook Pro 15\" Touch Bar 2017 came in contact with honey! The whole right side was affected. I opened it, cleaned up the mess, ordered a new audio jack, a speaker and a right fan. I also noticed that the power button was erratic but at least I could start it up by plugging in the charger. I gave the macbook back to the customer to use until the parts arrived.\n\nWhen the parts arrived, I foolishly took iFixit advice and disabled Auto Boot feature in terminal: s[B]udo nvram AutoBoot=%00. [\/B]I replaced the parts and now I cannot turn it on! Opening the lid, plugging in the charger or pressing the power button (whenever it decides to work) result in the same: fan spin for a couple of seconds and then dead.\n\nWhat now?"
