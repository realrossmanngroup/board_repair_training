The old battery was really bad and the liquid was near the battery connector so i orderd a new battery and replaced it but it did not fix the problem. \n\nI replaced the ISL but it did not help at all. Of course i checked some measurement before replacing but I'm lost right now so i could use your help!\n\nHere are some info:\n\nISL Pins\n\n17/18 about 5 ohms\n27/28 20.7 ohms.\n\nMacsafe charger when plugged turns green and to orange. Sometimes the orange fades away but it does not turn off. MacBook turns off right away when macsafe is removed, so the battery does not keep the computer awake.\n\nAlso my charger is new original Apples MagSafe 2 60W charger so this is not fake Chinese charger. :)"
