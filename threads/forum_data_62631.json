        "R7121": "What is R7121? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution.

This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. ."

            "message": "Hello. This board came from another store and had been cleaned previously, so I don't know where original damage was. Board was liquid damaged but all traces of liquid had been erased by cleaning. Board turns on, works on battery and on charger, but does not charge battery. Magsafe light comes green and orange but system says battery is not charging. Tried with another known good battery, same thing. Tried reballing SMC, same thing. <RESISTOR>R5380</RESISTOR> and 5381 are ok, both reading 2k. <RESISTOR>R5187</RESISTOR> reads 100k. Battery sensing resistors from ISL both read ok(<RESISTOR>R7151</RESISTOR>/52) and so do <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>/22. <RESISTOR>R7150</RESISTOR> also good. Where else should I check?"
