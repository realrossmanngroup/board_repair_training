            "message": "[PLAIN][SOLVED]<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> - Does not detect battery in OS, not charging or booting from battery[/PLAIN]\n\nHi there,\n\nCustomer came in with a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> motherboard that did not power on, replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> because bad voltages out and it booted again without issues.\nThe device has no signs of water damage or bad prior repairs.\n\nThe system does not detect a battery, It will not boot off one but if you pull the charger the device will not power off and keep on running from the battery (Until the OS finishes going in suspend). Once in suspend the system dies again while only connected to the battery\n\n\nPretty sure this is an issue with the <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA_SDA</SIGNAL> / SCL lines, but they seem to be doing ok-ish. I've seen 3.3V on SDA and pretty sure I've seen 3.3V on SCL as well.\nI2C pull-up resistors are not closed\n\nI thought I might have messed up the soldering so I swiped my iron another time on all the pins and ensured a proper connection. After that didn't work I replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> with another new chip from my reel but the same issue stays.\n\nWhere to look? There aren't many components connected to <SIGNAL>SMBUS_SMC_BSA</SIGNAL> and I'm starting to suspect the SMC. But all other sensors come back properly so I don't know.\n\nThanks in advance!"
