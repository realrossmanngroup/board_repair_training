If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",

Keeps booting in Safe mode. But I figured it was due to liquid damage on the keyboard. I could hold down shift when booting and it would do a normal boot and not go into safe mode. Figured the keyboard was screwed, as it would also act like I was holding down shift while pressing any keys (letters were all CAPS and numbers were all the secondary symbols (!@#$%^&*()_+)\n\nI replaced with a new keyboard and still has the same issue. I got frustrated last night and now am at work. I'll check between <CHIP>U5701</CHIP> and kb connector. I did clean the connector (didn't see any stickiness or corrosion, but cleaned anyway, to no avail.)\n\nDoes this sound like a trace issue?"

Instead of trying to figure that out, I just pulled another off a board and made sure to be very deliberate with my soldering this time and no more safe mode! All seems well. Thanks again Duke!!
