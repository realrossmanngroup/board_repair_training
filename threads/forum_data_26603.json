        "820-3476": "What is 820-3476? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "PP5V_S4": "What is PP5V_S4? PP5V_S4 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",

        "S4_PWR_EN": "What is S4_PWR_EN? S4_PWR_EN turns on the S4 power rails. Signals ending in _EN enable whatever came before _EN in the signal name when the voltage of the signal is high. .",

        "U1900": "What is U1900? a CHIP.",
        "5V_S4": "What is 5V_S4? This is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S4” – when you see this, assume the person typing it meant to type “PP5V_S4”.",
        "C1950": "What is C1950? Capacitor between PP3V42_G3H & ground on pin 8 of U1950 on 2013-2015 Macbook Pros & Airs that often corrodes. When corroded, pin 8 on U1950 will be damaged, which will prevent machine from booting and cause PM_SLP_S4_L to pulse. ."
