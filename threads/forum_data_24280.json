Using known-good side board and cable.\n\u2022 I have 3.42V going to the SMC.\n\u2022 No PP3V3_S5\n\nSMC_XTAL_R and SMC_XTAL are both at 3.4V. Not sure what this is telling me. Not sure why they would be up at 3.4V.\n\nPre-cleaning pics are attached, however, the board was cleaned before it got to us."
