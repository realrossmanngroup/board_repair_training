It looks like the SMC is off. Using known-good side board and cable.\n• I have 3.42V going to the SMC.\n• No <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL>\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_XTAL_R</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>SMC_XTAL</SIGNAL> are both at 3.4V. Not sure what this is telling me. Not sure why they would be up at 3.4V.\n\nPre-cleaning pics are attached, however, the board was cleaned before it got to us."
