Got this board here a couple of months ago that was not powering on. I fixed it and now it turns on and works with external display but no internal. I ordered a new LCD assembly to test, which works on another machine, but on this machine it does not work, just like original one. No video and no backlight. Tried replacing LVDS cable, still same. Where can I begin the troubleshooting? I tried replacing U8500 as it was getting 5V and I thought it may be not sending out PP5V_S0SW_LCD but still same."}
