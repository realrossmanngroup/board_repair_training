I ordered a new LCD assembly to test, which works on another machine, but on this machine it does not work, just like original one. No video and no backlight. Tried replacing LVDS cable, still same. Where can I begin the troubleshooting? I tried replacing <CHIP>U8500</CHIP> as it was getting 5V and I thought it may be not sending out <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL> but still same."
