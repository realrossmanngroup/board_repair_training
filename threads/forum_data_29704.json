Our stack of 3330 boards with video issues has grown to between 10-15. All with identical symptoms (yellow/purplish video anomalies; almost as if the LCD or LCD cable is bad, but of course the issue persists across numerous test units/assemblies, etc). Symptoms are very similar to cracked solder balls on the 2610/2850 GMUX, except a reflow of MUX doesn't seem to help on these. Maybe the MUX itself is simply failing on them? \n\nI was working with one and was going to put some time into it. Typical video issues that almost resemble a GMUX issue on the older models. I figured I'd reflow the MUX just to be safe; cleared the corner gel completely and reflowed the MUX with plenty of flux, and then tested it; however, I now have zero video at all (chimes, no video). Very confident the MUX wasn't killed (very comfortable with the procedure at this point), and it danced nicely so I don't think there were any stuck-epoxy/gel issues, etc. After the reflow, I lost video completely. I'm going to try replacing the MUX entirely, but had to order the proper stencil. I'm sure someone will have tried replacing the MUX on these as a first-step in diagnosing this issue, so I doubt that's the overarching issue for these boards, but it was curious that a simple reflow made the board lose video completely. I'm going to replace the MUX and see, but while I was thinking of it, I figured I'd post a new thread about it.\n\nThanks in advance. I hope everyone's having a nice week leading into the Holidays. :)"}, {"post_id": 29710, "thread_id": 29704, "title": "Any luck with the <s>[INST] [LOGIC_BOARD_PART_NUMBERS]820-3330[/LOGIC_BOARD_PART_NUMBERS]: Board part number 820-3330 fits a MacBook Pro Unibody computer from year Mid 2012 whose model number is A1286 with a screen size of 15\" and an EMC number of EMC 2556 [/INST]</s> video issues?", "user_id": 461, "username": "Gurmon", "post_date": "2017-12-21 14:07:49", "message": "I've been down the MUX route on this and its not the issue."}, {"post_id": 29718, "thread_id": 29704, "title": "Any luck with the <s>[INST] [LOGIC_BOARD_PART_NUMBERS]820-3330[/LOGIC_BOARD_PART_NUMBERS]: Board part number 820-3330 fits a MacBook Pro Unibody computer from year Mid 2012 whose model number is A1286 with a screen size of 15\" and an EMC number of EMC 2556 [/INST]</s> video issues?", "user_id": 2, "username": "dukefawks", "post_date": "2017-12-21 15:42:06", "message": "MUX issues will not crash the machine.
