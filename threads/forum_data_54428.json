    "definitions": {
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "P3V3S5_ENTRIP": "What is P3V3S5_ENTRIP? a SIGNAL.",
        "R1802": "What is R1802? a RESISTOR.",
        "R1803": "What is R1803? a RESISTOR.",
        "R1801": "What is R1801? a RESISTOR.",
        "C1802": "What is C1802? Capacitor to ground on PCH_SRTCRST_L on machines from 2009-2012, PCH_SRTCRST_L needs to be high for PCH to not be in RTC reset mode, this capacitor can become corroded or leaky and result in this signal being pulled low. .",
        "3V3_SUS": "What is 3V3_SUS? 3V3_SUS is an abbreviation for PP3V3_SUS. These are interchangeable. The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "RTC_RESET_L": "What is RTC_RESET_L? RTC_RESET_L is a reset signal that is present when the signal is low, the _L means it is asserted when the voltage is low. The RESET signal will keep the PCH from turning on or booting up the machine. .",
        "SYSCLK_CLK32K_RTC": "What is SYSCLK_CLK32K_RTC? a SIGNAL.",
        "C1803": "What is C1803? Capacitor to ground on RTC_RESET_L on machines from 2009-2012, RTC_RESET_L needs to be high for system to not be in RTC reset mode, this capacitor can become corroded or leaky and result in this signal being pulled low. ."
