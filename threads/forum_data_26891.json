        "A1398": "What is A1398? A1398 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Mid 2015, Mid 2012, Early 2013, Late 2013, Mid 2014 with EMC 2909, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00138, 820-00163, 820-00426, 820-3332, 820-3662, 820-3787..",
        "820-3662": "What is 820-3662? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CHGR_BGATE": "What is CHGR_BGATE? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q7155": "What is Q7155? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA": "What is SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA? SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA is the data line of an I2C data line between the battery charging chip that creates PPBUS_G3H, the system management controller(SMC), the battery, and the battery indicator LED. If this lineâ€™s resistance to ground is too low because of a defective component, battery will not be recognized with an X on the icon and PPBUS_G3H voltage will be lower than it is on a good system..",
        "R7151": "What is R7151? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "ISL6259": "What is ISL6259? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2010 through 2015."

I have <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> model with <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3662</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-a board that shows \"X\" on battery indicator. Initialy the machine stopped powering on after the owner took it apart to fix the hinges. Then he took it to a technician who managed to make it power on but only with the charger pluged in. After that I got it. The battery is marked with an X and if I take off the charger the machine goes to [URL=\"http://wikipedia.org\"]sleep[/URL].\nPP3v42 is present\nSMBUS lines look ok\nI get 11.5 V on <SIGNAL>CHGR_BGATE</SIGNAL> witch is pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> and I guess that does not alow it to open.\n[URL=\"https://mailin.repair/catalogsearch/result/?q=isl\"]ISL[/URL] and <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR> chip have been changed, but I still get 11.5v on <SIGNAL>CHGR_BGATE</SIGNAL>.\nI am not verry experienced with this but I am trying pretty hard so some help would much apreciated.\nThan you."
