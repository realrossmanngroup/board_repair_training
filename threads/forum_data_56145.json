            "message": "Hi. Been at this Macbook Pro repair for a while. The unit just decided to not power up one day so it was brought in to us for repair. Tested with a Type C PD tester and an external power supply which originally dialed up 20V contract but the current draw was very low (close to 0 mA). After reviewing, the <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP> (<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>) was removed; pads cleaned; found a few bad tantalums that were shorted downstream and they have been now replaced. As the <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP> is a bear to solder on without the Amtech flux which we currently do not have nor a microscope, wish to ask a few questions before proceeding further:\n\n1) Is the <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP> required to be present to allow for the 20V power delivery contract to be enabled?\n\n2) In tracing the schematic, see that the EN (<SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>) of the Maxim 3v3 LDO (<CHIP>U6903</CHIP>) originates from <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP> (<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>). However, what if <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> is not stuffed and <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> is manually enabled. Then should the external 20V power delivery contract be negotiated?\n\nAs far as we can tell, the <CHIP>ISL9239</CHIP> (<CHIP>U7000</CHIP>) is the battery charger but also enables the Maxim 3v3 LDO (<CHIP>U6903</CHIP>) but not sure if the OS boot code will ping the (missing) <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> Buck (boost?) regulator and quit if the I2C coms time out due to retries so thought to ask here...\n\nThe dual diode @ <DIODE>D6902</DIODE> was damaged and has been replaced.\n\nAt this time, only +5v0 from the outside power supply is fed into the board but is also at a low current draw (a few mA).\n\nThanks for any feedback you can supply."

Will work on the replacement of <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> today.\n\nA few more questions:\n\n1) Can you comment on F7000? Is that a one-time fuse or a polymer (resettable) fuse? The original is in tact but wish to know if it can be replaced and with which part number (if known)?\n\n2) What are the resistor values for <RESISTOR>R7015</RESISTOR> (0201 schematic states 750K) & <RESISTOR>R7016</RESISTOR> (0201 schematic states 255K) but reading (without <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> installed) on 2 different ohm meters:\n\n<RESISTOR>R7015</RESISTOR> = 189K / 192k\n<RESISTOR>R7016</RESISTOR> = 186K / 190k\n\nfor this resistor voltage divider. Fairly confident these resistors are the factory originals. Can order in some 750k / 255k to replace. This resistor voltage divider is to lower the voltage to a safe value for the DC/DC <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> to detect the presence of an external voltage rail but wish to validate the resistor values that should be present."

Was concerned about the \"off value\" for this area and did exactly as you suggested, removed the high side resistor and it indeed does measure around 750K (as per the schematic) and the south side as per the schematic. The in-circuit value was throwing off the reading. Sorry for this error on judgement.\n\nNot required yet but will see if I can source a drop in replacement from Mouser / Digikey / Arrow.\n\nNext on this hit list is to replace <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> which will be fun.

Could the CPU itself be bad?\n\nWait...L7220 is still in the circuit. So this IOT green design (32A capable so CR2032 friendly??) is using 2 DC-DC buck regulators to power this rail. Let me at this L7220 and will report back...\n\nBoth L7210 & L7220 are moved from motherboard, still the <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> rail is being shorted to ground.\n\nSo it could be due to one of the many caps on this rail (sheet 10 of the schematic)?\n\nTime to start drinking...\n\nWould a thermal camera help to show which cap is causing this short? Given that the power supply rail (5v0) cycles every few seconds, would the thermal camera even show the bad boy cap? Read that the offshore thermal camera (QIANLI) is one of the FLIR sensors in a box so the phone camera version (by FLIR) could work as well?\n\nDepressing :("
