        "820-2879": "What is 820-2879? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CHGR_ACOK": "What is CHGR_ACOK? This is identical to SMC_BC_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",
        "R7022": "What is R7022? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution.

I get 17.09 volts on pin one but 0 on pin 2, <RESISTOR>R7010</RESISTOR> is giving the correct resistance at 30.1k ohms, but <RESISTOR>R7011</RESISTOR> gives .5 ohms on the board and the correct 9.3k ohms off the board, I have no idea why Im getting the wrong value when on the board. While the resistor is off I get infinite resistance between 1 and 2 as expected."
