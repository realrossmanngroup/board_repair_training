            "message": "Hello,\n\nThis computer firstly was brought in for a no power issue. Visual inspection showed no corrosion whatsoever, but showed one of the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> blown up.\nAfter replacing it the computer remained taking 5V on one port and 20V on the other although the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> I took is from an M1 MacBook Pro (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-02020</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) but IDK.. anyway that's not the issue.. the computer was still not powering on even on 20V.. I noticed some consumption on the ammeter I took the thermal camera and noticed <CHIP>U5700</CHIP> was heating up (3.8 AON generator).. I took it off and replaced it..\n\nAfter this the computer boots but with no backlight\n- tested a good display, still no backlight\n- tested without the audio board, guessed maybe it could do something funky, still no backlight\n- measured backlight fuse it was OK\n- checked backlight Vsense on backlight chip there were 12V\n- Backlight enable from PMU is there. \n- Measured some values of resistance to few resistors and noticed backlight 5V A resistor (RP845) should be 0 ohms and it read 200 ohms I have replaced it\n- Measured 5V D resistor and it was 50 ohms instead of 0, I took the voltage readings and it was 5.188V precisely as it should; have not replaced it\n- Both 5V D and A are showing as 5.188V exactly.\n- I have measured <SIGNAL>BK_SD</SIGNAL> (backlight shutdown) and it was 12V telling the backlight to reset.\n- I have replaced UP800 from <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>; still no backlight.\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to do next?"

I removed the coil and measured and short was on the S2 side not switching side..\nI injected 0.5v and UP701 (display switch) heated up.. removed it and still short it there, short is not clear as before but there's low resistance to ground. Before it was 0.001 on diode mode now its 0.039. With the S2 coil removed the computer takes 20V again and when I measure <SIGNAL>3V3_S2</SIGNAL> it fluctuates."
