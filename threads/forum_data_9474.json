I was also thinking if beep the ground legs I could find out which way it goes.  But the two grounds don't beep.  But looking at the datasheet the grounds aren't connected inside so I get no beep.  And it looks like it is two separate things in one and the same either way you put it.\nIs this thinking correct? Or will it only work one way and I have to try both to see which one works?"
