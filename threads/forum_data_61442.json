Replaced all.  Damage near mux chip and U7370.  Replaced both and buddies nearby. \n\nCPU VCC not present, GPUVCC stable around .9V with screen plugged in.  Meanwhile the PCH hits about 53 degrees C and stays there.  I dont think i can replace the PCH.  Are there telltale signals coming from or to the mux or pch that would tell me what stage this thing's stuck in?"}
