Damage near mux chip and <CHIP>U7370</CHIP>.  Replaced both and buddies nearby. \n\nCPU VCC not present, GPUVCC stable around .9V with screen plugged in.  Meanwhile the PCH hits about 53 degrees C and stays there.  I dont think i can replace the PCH.  Are there telltale signals coming from or to the mux or pch that would tell me what stage this thing's stuck in?"
