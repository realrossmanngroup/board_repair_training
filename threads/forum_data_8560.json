Board is <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2530</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A.\nMachine charges, turns on (chime sound) and can be started into target disk mode. However, there is no video out. Not on the internal LCD and not through the MINI DVI Port. PRAM and SMC have been reset.\nGPU failure seems unlikely on this machine. Any idea where to start troubleshooting?\n\nCheers,\n\nHendrik"
