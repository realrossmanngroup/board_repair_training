        "message":"Hi, so I have an interesting problem. Got in a liquid damaged 16 Inch MacBook Pro for a customer for board repair. Well there is no fixing this thing, it is toast. I sold him an exact replacement 16\" as I had a used one. Well he called me next day saying his professional software he uses for work doesn't want to activate. Turns out its bound to a particular serial number. And the company said its like 1000EUR to get a replacement licence (he told me its a 15k piece of software). Not great....\n\nIs there any way to transfer the Serial? On the old Macs I could just reprogram the EFI flash chip and it was a done deal. Well this doesn't seem to be the same on T2 enabled machines. I did see two videos using this programmer ([URL]https:\/\/www.unionrepair.com\/by-t200-t2-data-assistant-for-macbook-read-backup-repair.html[\/URL]), but I have no idea if this is even real (I mean it was just on YT) and if this specialty programmer is the only way to do this... I don't want to drop 200EUR (with import and shipping) to find out this was all complete BS. \n\nAnyone ever tried this before?"
