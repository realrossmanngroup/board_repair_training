(with room light off it's the backlight) I shine a light through the back and nothing on screen no logo or anything. OK I shut it down and hooked an external monitor to it then started up again and screen is normal image but nothing on external monitor. I can unhook monitor and the screen stays on just fine BUT reboot and no video again. I can repeat the process to get the screen on but what would cause this?????\nForgot to mention that I checked both sides of board for corrosion and anything out of the normal and was the cleanest board I ever seen, looked brand new no signs of anything. Also tried a PRAM and SMC reset and did nothing."
