It comes from PCH and goes to KBC. KBC recived 3-0-3V from power button, lid - 3V, 3V power is present.\nI know pwrbtn# pull up resistor is in PCH, and KBC just short pwrbtn# to ground when power button is pressed. But I am not sure if KBC is bad, so it always short pwrbtn# to ground or PCH is bad and it doesnot pullup 3V to this line.[\/B]"}
