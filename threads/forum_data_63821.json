The keyboard light does not light up, but the keyboard is definetly working, it allows me to type in the wifi password. The fan is not spinning fast. I am assuming this is a thermal sensor issue? The wifi never does finish connecting from recovery mode. \nI am not certain what else to look at. I checked all the parts on the thermal sensors page. Does anything ending in DN (<SIGNAL>THMSNSB_DN</SIGNAL>) is this supposed to be ground?"

            "message": "Update; fan is not spinning so I placed down kapton tape over the cables since some of the clips were missing. This did seem to help because now I get the keyboards caps lock light to come on. The fan still does not spin and the globe just got stuck when doing an internet recovery for the first time. I never could get the computer to do a diagnostic mode since it wants to connect to the internet. I have a USB-C ethernet adapter which never works. The computer also turns itself on after a few seconds even if you do not press any buttons or mess with the lid. It just keeps turning itself on. I am getting the 5 volts to the fan keyboard connector on the backside of the keyboard (j6700) on both pins 20 and 1. Same for the fan connector on the keyboard backside.Would the battery cause this?\nI also did a Restore and Revive from DFU mode. Also a SMC and PRAM reset. I also replaced the fan."
