        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "C7310": "What is C7310? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",

        "U8170": "What is U8170? a CHIP.",
        "PP5VS4_EN": "What is PP5VS4_EN? P5VS4_EN is a signal that enables the power chip responsible for creating PP5V_S4 when it is high. Signals with _EN mean that whatever is mentioned before the _EN will be enabled or turned on when the signal is high. .",

        "PM_S0_PGOOD": "What is PM_S0_PGOOD?  PM_S0_PGOOD is created when CPUVR_PGOOD and ALL_SYS_PWRGD are present and branches off to become PM_PCH_PWROK. PM_S0_PGOOD and SMC_DELAYED_PWRGD are necessary to create SYS_PWROK_R and PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK .",
