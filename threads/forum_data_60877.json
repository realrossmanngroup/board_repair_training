        "820-3115": "What is 820-3115? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U2600": "What is U2600? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "PP1V8_S0": "What is PP1V8_S0? PP1V8_S0 is a power rail that is present when the machine is in an S0 state, meaning it is fully turned on, not sleeping or hiberating .",
        "T29BST_BOOST": "What is T29BST_BOOST? a SIGNAL.",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON – CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."

            "message": "I'm working on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board which as customer claims stopped working suddenly. I've inspected it very closely, there is no physical or liquid damage. With battery disconnected and only charger connected it has green light, but it doesn't switch to orange. With battery connected it shows green then orange. Board turns on, there is fan spin. When trackpad is disconnected fan goes to high speed. With trackpad connected it spins with normal speed, though there is no chime, no image on screen. With RAM removed it doesn't beep three times as it should. \n\n\nBelow I post some basic voltages:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12,6v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3,47v\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> - 3,47v\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> - 3,44v\n\nCPU VCORE - 1,12v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S0</SIGNAL> - 1,81v\n\n<SIGNAL>T29BST_BOOST</SIGNAL> - 2,6v -> isn't it too low? According to schematic it should be 8-12v\n\nWhat I have done so far:\n\n- replaced clock chip <CHIP>U2600</CHIP> - no result \n\n- reflowed SMC - no result\n\n- tried new BIOS and new BIOS chip - no result\n\nIn another thread Louis wrote, that it can be corrosion under SMC/PCH. There are no signs of liquid on both. I don't know if it's worth to take off SMC and reball it ot it's not this case?"
