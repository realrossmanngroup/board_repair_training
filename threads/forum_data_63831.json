        "message":"Hello,\n\nI have an iMac with a faulty motherboard it seems. None of the LED light indicators are on and I confirmed that 12V is being provided by the power supply. I also replaced the power supply to rule it out. Seems to be failing very early in the boot process and I am wondering how can I start with the troubleshooting.\n\nThank you."

If diode mode is good (high resistance), then the chip is bad? It was a low resistance (0.070 or so) and thought chip was faulty so I replaced it. I misunderstood, but I am getting 4.4 volts now?\n\nREG_P3V3S5_VOUT is 0.5 volts and resistance is 0.100. Is resistance normal?\n\nEDIT: PP12V_S5 is now gone from the power supply - I think it just failed. Does the PSU have to be connected to the motherboard to provide 12V?"
