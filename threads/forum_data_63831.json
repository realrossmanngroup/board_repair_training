The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely.

It was a low resistance (0.070 or so) and thought chip was faulty so I replaced it. I misunderstood, but I am getting 4.4 volts now?\n\n<SIGNAL>REG_P3V3S5_VOUT</SIGNAL> is 0.5 volts and resistance is 0.100.
