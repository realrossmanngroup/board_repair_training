        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
        "BKL_EN": "What is BKL_EN? BKL_EN enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. ."

There were some water damaged componentes with wrong values aroung  <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> so changed them and <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> too and backlight turned on. After a couple of hours it was off again. Checked and seems that all values are correct. The only thing i can see is that <SIGNAL>PPVIN_SW_T29BST</SIGNAL> line is shitted, some components has pins like black but there is no short to ground. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_SW_T29BST</SIGNAL> - 2.6V\n\n\nMy question is <SIGNAL>PPVIN_SW_T29BST</SIGNAL> can make backlight not work propery?"
