The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

            "message": "This board is water damaged at spots like USB A and B circuitry including <CHIP>U4650</CHIP> <CHIP>U4600</CHIP>. And top side near edges and battery connector. There is no rust, it seems something like coffee...\nKeyboard lever connector is gone and Pin 1 <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> and Pin 2 GND of keyboard connector were physically touching each others, plastic melted...\n\nIt booted fine with internal HDD but keyboard and trackpad were not working.\n\nBefore replacing keyboard connector I just cleaned it and made sure pins 1 and 2 are not touching anymore, removed the short but it was still low 0.7V and found out the zero ohm <RESISTOR>R7803</RESISTOR> on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S4</SIGNAL> blown up to 500kohm.\nReplaced <RESISTOR>R7803</RESISTOR>, made sure same diode mode reading compared with other board and board powered up fine with trackpad working fluently but keyboard had some keys not working (arrows, caps lock and some others) shift keys and alt are working.\n\nUSB data filter L4610 was blown, I replaced it and now both usb ports are working.\n\nMy issues:\n\n-Keyboard is missing some keys no caps lock (no green light on caps key :) ) no arrows and some others...\n-USB A & B are working slow. It boots slowly from external HDD, partitions appear very slowly, ASD EFI take much more time to load but passes all sensors and boot rom tests. This behaviour is with keyboard plugged and unplugged.\n\nDidn't ultrasonic yet the board, I am affraid something wrong with USB portion of PCH. I don't see something else common to USB A and B besides PCH.\n\nBefore starting to replace <CHIP>U4650</CHIP> and <CHIP>U4600</CHIP> or ultrasonic the board, is there something I can check before? Could keyboard connector cause this slowliness on USB port?\n\nThanks"

Sorry my old good testing kbd ended up with a bad flex cable.\nPlease find attached diode mode readings for kbd connector unplugged, they match the ones on a good board. I still have to replace the broken kbd connector.\n\nNow my concern is slow data transfer on both usb ports...\nNot sure what I am doing now but I checked if <SIGNAL>USB_HUB_SOFT_RESET_L</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>USB_HUB_RESET_L</SIGNAL> were not partially messed, they were 3.3V. <RESISTOR>R2070</RESISTOR> <SIGNAL>PCH_USB_RBIAS</SIGNAL> measured good also.\n\nWill check for corroded traces and ultrasonic the board, maybe some crap under PCH."

When launched, it took time (almost 1 minute) in ''searching for hardware to run tests...'' but it was exactly same on the other board.\n\nBy the way IR/BT/CAM/KBD/TP tested ok and worked fluently.\n\nMaybe normal with this particular board or partition issue.
