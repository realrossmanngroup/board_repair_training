        "message":"This board is water damaged at spots like USB A and B circuitry including U4650 U4600. And top side near edges and battery connector. There is no rust, it seems something like coffee...\nKeyboard lever connector is gone and Pin 1 PP3V3_S4 and Pin 2 GND of keyboard connector were physically touching each others, plastic melted...\n\nIt booted fine with internal HDD but keyboard and trackpad were not working.\n\nBefore replacing keyboard connector I just cleaned it and made sure pins 1 and 2 are not touching anymore, removed the short but it was still low 0.7V and found out the zero ohm R7803 on PP3V3_S4 blown up to 500kohm.\nReplaced R7803, made sure same diode mode reading compared with other board and board powered up fine with trackpad working fluently but keyboard had some keys not working (arrows, caps lock and some others) shift keys and alt are working.\n\nUSB data filter L4610 was blown, I replaced it and now both usb ports are working.\n\nMy issues:\n\n-Keyboard is missing some keys no caps lock (no green light on caps key :) ) no arrows and some others...\n-USB A & B are working slow. It boots slowly from external HDD, partitions appear very slowly, ASD EFI take much more time to load but passes all sensors and boot rom tests. This behaviour is with keyboard plugged and unplugged.\n\nDidn't ultrasonic yet the board, I am affraid something wrong with USB portion of PCH. I don't see something else common to USB A and B besides PCH.\n\nBefore starting to replace U4650 and U4600 or ultrasonic the board, is there something I can check before? Could keyboard connector cause this slowliness on USB port?\n\nThanks"

        "message":"Back to this board. Yes I already did PRAM reset and it booted well into OSX. Tested with other keyboard and all keys worked fine. Sorry my old good testing kbd ended up with a bad flex cable.\nPlease find attached diode mode readings for kbd connector unplugged, they match the ones on a good board. I still have to replace the broken kbd connector.\n\nNow my concern is slow data transfer on both usb ports...\nNot sure what I am doing now but I checked if USB_HUB_SOFT_RESET_L, USB_HUB_RESET_L were not partially messed, they were 3.3V. R2070 PCH_USB_RBIAS measured good also.\n\nWill check for corroded traces and ultrasonic the board, maybe some crap under PCH."

        "message":"Keyboard connector replaced and worked ok. Did some transfer tests, compared with known good board and I got same thing on both board:\n\n8.48GB from external usb hdd to internal (sata) hdd 4min08sec vs 4min09sec on known good board\n8.48GB from internal (sata) hdd to external usb hdd 5min02sec vs 5min07sec on known good board\n\nI guess I forgot the difference between usb 2 and 3 :)\nWhat trolled me mostly was EFI 3S144. When launched, it took time (almost 1 minute) in ''searching for hardware to run tests...'' but it was exactly same on the other board.\n\nBy the way IR\/BT\/CAM\/KBD\/TP tested ok and worked fluently.\n\nMaybe normal with this particular board or partition issue. Now board is 100% ok.\n\nI call it ''solved'', you can please close the post."
