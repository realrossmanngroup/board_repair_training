The device was water damaged. However, I couldn't find any proof of water inside! I checked the Power Rails and noticed that everything including <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> is ok. But the first S3 Rail (<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>) isn’t. It's reading is 0V! I checked the beginning of the circuit and noted that the ENTRIP signal for <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> is 0V. Pin 2 on <TRANSISTOR>Q7221</TRANSISTOR> is 3,3V. That’s why this Transistor sends the ENTRIP to ground I think. I followed this path and saw that this ENABEL come from a Transistor which is closed by <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>, which is also 0V on this machine. There is no Short on <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>. I've already checked the input and output signals of the PCH which only confuse me. I can't find any other S5 Rails needed for the PCH to turn on (like <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S5</SIGNAL> on other boards do). I'm stuck at this point. I hope you can understand my bad English. It would be really great if someone could give me a hint where I have to Look next.\nTanks!"

This would mean that the keyboard is damaged and i´m sorry that i wasted your time. if not i´ll let you know. By the way: How can i find out which pads i have to short on which board to turn it on?"
