Is liquid damaged but only in a small area of the board around <CHIP>U8400</CHIP>. I've found <CHIP>U5450</CHIP> is completely burned to the point that even the traces on the board aren't there and will need to be repaired. That being said does anyone know where I can get a replacement for <CHIP>U5450</CHIP>? I've searched INA214A and am only finding the SC-70 version!\n\nAlternatively is there another replacement part I can use for <CHIP>U5450</CHIP>?"

            "message": "As a further update to this I couldn't find any on the boards I had. I've tried NCS214 which does work just the same and I also had to replace <CHIP>U5410</CHIP> which I replaced with NCS210. \nSo for future reference you can replace INA214A with NCS214 and INA210A with NCS210 providing you buy the correct UQFN package type.\n\nAfter fixing these issues the board powers up but the power button wasn't working - checked the voltage - 1.8v there which drops to 0v when depressed. Checked <SIGNAL>PMU_ON_OFF_L</SIGNAL> which was at 3.3v and didnt drop when the power button was pressed, shorting <SIGNAL>PMU_ON_OFF_L</SIGNAL> to ground made the machine power up so on the basis this particular machine is urgently wanted back by customer i've removed <CHIP>U4901</CHIP> and <RESISTOR>R4971</RESISTOR> and jumpered <SIGNAL>PMU_ON_OFF_L</SIGNAL> directly to <SIGNAL>PMU_ONOFF_R_L</SIGNAL> and now i've got a fully working power button. Not really understanding why Apple bothered putting <CHIP>U4901</CHIP> there as from what I understand on the schematic this particular IC takes 3 inputs and sends the output to 1 output yet Apple have tied the other two inputs straight to ground on the board. Perhaps someone in the know can explain this one to me and if my approach is likely to cause any issues?"
