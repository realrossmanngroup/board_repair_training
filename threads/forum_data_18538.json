        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "BKLT_EN": "What is BKLT_EN? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKLT” before “_EN”. “BKLT” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. .",

        "D9701": "What is D9701? diode in the backlight circuit sitting between the BKL_SW pin of the LED driver and backlight output. Very common for via between this and BKL_FB for feedback to blow, causing no boost. Measure continuity between pin 2 of this diode and feedback pin of LED driver if backlight output is PPBUS_G3H with no boost.",
        "LCD_BKLT_EN": "What is LCD_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

            "message": "got in a soda damaged 2850 board,  brought it back to life but i have no backlight.  i did replace the lvds connector and pin 40-38 on <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> pads seem to have connected together is this a problem? also how does <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> get to that part of the board?  pin 39 & 38 pads are also not connecting to the end of the pad they are only about half of the pad where the pins from the lvds connector are.  was wondering if this might be the problem? if so where should i run a wire from? can i scrape back the board in front of the pad?  or does it come from somewhere else?  i checked <SIGNAL>BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> and its there.  checked the fuse also good. \n\nThe only thing i notice on this board is that it takes a 10 seconds from plugging in the power until the chime and screen try to go on.  i do have data. and it does boot all the way.  \n\nThanks \nNate"

Seriously wtf i dont know, i was doing a couple lvds connectors this morning guess i was not paying attention on that one at all!  will change that out... i got it right on the other 2 boards i did. don't know how i missed that. \n\nanyway voltages are good now. and im not sure if that killed the fuse but the bklt fuse was bad and now all is working good. \\\n\nTHanks for that Duke, and thanks aprendiz. Also want to point out that this is 2010 not 2011, and also that 2011 lvds are the same as 2010. if im seeing correctly.  :)"
