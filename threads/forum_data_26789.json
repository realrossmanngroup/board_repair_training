No waterdamage\/visible damage. I fixed that and had to replace the SMC. Now it has a green \/orange light again, battery indicator works, it turns on, has backlight and even chimes, but thats it. I cant enter boot menu (tried external keyboard too) and it also won\u00b4t boot from a known good installation drive. Now i am stuck. \nThanks for any help."}

R6905 had a hole in it and C6990 was split in half. I replaced U6990 too to be sure... How can i know if the SMC is correct? i thought there are only the \"980\" and the \"F211\" SMCs...  Or has it to be from a board with the exact same 820-XXXX number?"}

Im not sure but this can be the first time i had not the same donor to take the smc from. I try to take all parts from the exact same board if possible.

That was the issue... right SMC, SMC reset and new D6905 (won\u00b4t run from battery) ant this one is fixed finally. i think that was the sixth SMC i put on this board... The first times i thought it was bad soldering... Incredible how lucky i was until now. I replaced quiet a lot SMCs and they worked - without me knowing this..."}

Thank you or the lesson. 99% i replaced SMCs on 3115 and 2936. They have different SMCs fortunately. Some 3437 too, but I took the SMCs (as all parts) from the exact same donor if possible and ordered new donor boards early to avoid any problems. This board was one of my first ones - or even the first one - i soldered on a SMC from a different donor and instantly experienced some issues. I had not the exact same donor lying around and could not find them easy to buy.\nSo some boards could be working with wrong SMCs while having some problems? And is it ok to reball the F211 SMCs (0.45mm balls) with the 980 (0.38mm balls) stancils?"}

Any idea if they can be used on other machines or are they just useless like the iPhone 7 Homebutton replacements?"}

But they're a rare find.\n\nJust get the right stencils, its a few bucks on ebay or ali"}
