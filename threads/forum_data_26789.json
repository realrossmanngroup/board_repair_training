This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

I fixed that and had to replace the SMC. Now it has a green /orange light again, battery indicator works, it turns on, has backlight and even chimes, but thats it. I cant enter boot menu (tried external keyboard too) and it also won´t boot from a known good installation drive. Now i am stuck. \nThanks for any help."

Some 3437 too, but I took the SMCs (as all parts) from the exact same donor if possible and ordered new donor boards early to avoid any problems. This board was one of my first ones - or even the first one - i soldered on a SMC from a different donor and instantly experienced some issues. I had not the exact same donor lying around and could not find them easy to buy.\nSo some boards could be working with wrong SMCs while having some problems? And is it ok to reball the F211 SMCs (0.45mm balls) with the 980 (0.38mm balls) stancils?"
