I replaced the trackpad and keyboard to make sure and the IO board doesn't have any damage. I have R5270 contacts missing completely and pin 1 is pp3v3_s3 which i can connect with r5271 but pin 2 is going to SMC. With the first liquid damage there was an issue near U7600 but that's been taken care off. Any ideas would be appreciated"}
