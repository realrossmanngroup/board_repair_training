I replaced the trackpad and keyboard to make sure and the IO board doesn't have any damage. I have <RESISTOR>R5270</RESISTOR> contacts missing completely and pin 1 is <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> which i can connect with <RESISTOR>R5271</RESISTOR> but pin 2 is going to SMC. With the first liquid damage there was an issue near <CHIP>U7600</CHIP> but that's been taken care off. Any ideas would be appreciated"
