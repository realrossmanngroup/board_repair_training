A1286 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Unibody from years Late 2008, Mid 2009, Mid 2009 , Mid 2010, Early 2011, Late 2011, Mid 2012 with EMC 2255, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-2330, 820-2532, 820-2523, 820-2533, 820-2850, 820-2915, 820-3330..",

        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

It's a big help as I venture into motherboard repair.\n\nWould love some help with a 2012 MacBook Pro <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1286</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-B).  It turns on, I hear the chime, but no display:\n\n1) I tried another display - same result, so I'm assuming the issue is at component level.  The board looks great apart from some some dust - no liquid damage or prior work that I can tell.\n\n2) I measured the backlight fuse F9700 (with display connected) - 12.5 volts on both sides.\n\n3) Going down the line <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>, I measured <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> on output (pin 6) - 0 volts.  Would this be the first thing to replace?\n\n4) Diode measure for <RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R9788</RESISTOR> are .450 and .900."

There is no L9008 on this board - I think that's for the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1278</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> model, but I think I understand what you mean.  The equivalent on this board is L9000, but as I mentioned there's 0 volts going through <CHIP>U9000</CHIP>, so none would reach the inductor L9000.  I'm having trouble figuring out what to jump to next."

I put it back together, but no more display - chimes, blinks for a split second, then black.\n\nNot sure how it's related to the display, but the issue turned out to be the battery indicator cable - I checked this three times. Plug in the battery indicator cable, no more display. Unplug it, display works just fine. I went ahead and replaced the battery indicator cable and board, and sure enough, the display works normally.\n\nThank you for your insight Louis and dukefawks. Please close this thread."
