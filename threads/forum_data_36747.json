It's heating up when I run voltage through the line. Is my only path here to replace U2800? Is there any way around U2800? Would I have power but no ability to do anything else with the USB-C ports if I cut off power to U2800? Or would the computer just not work?"}

I expect is will but have not confirmed it. If it is shorted it needs to come off anyway so go and find out."}
