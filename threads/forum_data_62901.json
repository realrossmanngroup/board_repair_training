Sometimews it powers on OK, and other times it dosen't power on. Some times I get green light on the charger, and other times i don't. Sometimes I only get green light with the charger in one position (If fliped the cable) it donÂ´t get green light, but sometimes the mac powers on even so.\n\nSometimes it boots pushing the power button and other times it only boots connecting the charger.\n\nFirst it wasen' powering on at all, and the client said that it happend after a fall. I already replaced the SMC, and it started to power on- Then  I replaced the battery, but it has the same behavier. It seams to first happend, when it goes out of battery.\n\nSometimes the battery apears with 100% charge, and afetr a reboot it has 35%, 15, 20...\n\nCan you help?"
