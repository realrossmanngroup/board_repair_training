        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",

        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

After reballing i tested the machine & all was good. So i took the board out & Ultrasonic cleaned it to clean flux residue etc..\nAfter reassembling, when i turn it on the Caps Lock light is always on & cannot be turned off\nAnd when booted into OS the keyboard & trackpad are not detected. (USB Mouse\\Keyboard works)\n\nWith machine off i can reset the SMC via keyboard & power on/off with keyboard.\nI cannot do a PRAM Reset. Tried a brand new trackpad cable with same issue. \nNo corrosion on J4800 area & no liquid damage.\nAlso, i thought i might have bodged the SMC Reball so i re-reballed it being very meticulous & exact same issue.\n\nAny advice appreciated ?\nThanks."
