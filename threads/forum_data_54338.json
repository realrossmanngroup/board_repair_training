After reballing i tested the machine & all was good. So i took the board out & Ultrasonic cleaned it to clean flux residue etc..\nAfter reassembling, when i turn it on the Caps Lock light is always on & cannot be turned off\nAnd when booted into OS the keyboard & trackpad are not detected. (USB Mouse\\Keyboard works)\n\nWith machine off i can reset the SMC via keyboard & power on\/off with keyboard.\nI cannot do a PRAM Reset. Tried a brand new trackpad cable with same issue. \nNo corrosion on J4800 area & no liquid damage.\nAlso, i thought i might have bodged the SMC Reball so i re-reballed it being very meticulous & exact same issue.\n\nAny advice appreciated ?\nThanks."}

But just thought i should add: on J4800 (Pin 15) \"TPAD_USB_IF_EN_CONN\" i am getting 1.2ohm to GND (on the trackpad with cable disconnected)\nIs that a short to GND or should \"TPAD_USB_IF_EN_CONN\" have such a low resistance on the trackpad end ?\nAnd \"TPAD_USB_IF_EN_CONN\" is only getting 0.3v when connected & 3.3v when disconnected.\n\nUpdate: If i disconnect the Keyboard from the Trackpad i get 500ohm to gnd on TPAD_USB_IF_EN_CONN & when magsafe connected i get 1.5v then drops to 0.3v after power cycling..."}
