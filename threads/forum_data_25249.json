What he mean? I dont see hdd sensor in this model.\nI read about and seems that fan will speed fast randomly. Any solution for it?"}

The SMC will just read the HD temp as 0 degrees and keep the fan at normal speed."}

Note that you must be careful to not drop excess solder across the board anywhere. This only works if you want the fans to spin at low speed all of the time. If you want them to spin faster you must use a fan control, as the reported temp is now always 0."}
