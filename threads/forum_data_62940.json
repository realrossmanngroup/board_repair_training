            "message": "Hi !\n\nThis board come from a <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1706</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>, not turning on, that has been lightly liquid damaged, but at the wrong spot. Indeed, oxydation was on right side of <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> (pin 1 to 5), and also on <CAPACITOR>C7433</CAPACITOR>, nothing too big here. The rest of the board was in good condition.\n\nI replaced <CHIP>U7210</CHIP> and <CAPACITOR>C7433</CAPACITOR>, then the Mac turned on, Apple logo for few sec, progess bar appeared and then froze for 10 sec. The MacBook boot loop, again and again.\n\nI replaced <CHIP>U7430</CHIP>, I though it could have been also damaged, no change. Then I cleaned ME Region, no change. I replaced BIOS with know working one, no change, I put the original one back.\n\nLast step, I put the board in ultrasonic cleaner, it could have crap under CPU, still same behavior.\n\nWhat could cause a freeze while loading OS, and what could I check next ?\n\nThank you for your advises."

Boot in safe mode has same result as normal boot, crash immediately at the beginning of the loading. Finally, Target Mode does not work, I have 2 logos on target screen (power and USB), but nothing on host. I tried with 2 different official thunderbolt cables.\n\nWhen the Mac is waiting for internet network selection in recovery mode, it is able so stay on w/o any problem, but as soon as I enter password and it start downloading OS recovery it freeze and shut off.\n\nOne more thing I did not mention before, I've tried the board in an other casing to rule out the possibility of bad screen, battery, trackpad or keyboard, same result."
