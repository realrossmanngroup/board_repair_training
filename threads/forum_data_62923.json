No signs of liquid. Just stopped charging.\n\nWith the board out, on 3 of the ports I get 5.12v 0.37-0.39a and the 4th port (left side front) I get 5.14v but only 0.13a.\n\nWith the 3 ports I get 12.2v constant on PPBUS but 0v on the low port.\nIf I switch for a different dc in board, I get the same readings\n\nI'm not sure where to start with this."}
