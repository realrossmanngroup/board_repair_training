I replaced the really nasty looking stuff just to be safe. Now board doesn't work at all. :(:mad: Going down the power rail list I found that PPBUS_X239_REG is at .015V and is supposed to be a 12V rail.\n\nQ7979 Measurements\n\npins 1,2,3 @ 12.51V\npin 4 @ 11.70V\npin 5 @ 0.015V\n Resistance on PPBUS_X239_REG, 97.4K \n\nThank! a good one."}
