But no sing of liquid damage.\nWhen I press the power button the fan spins up a little bit and that's it. It does not do the on-off loop.\n\nHere are the measurements:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.57V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> 5V\n<SIGNAL>RTC_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3V\n32kHz present\nY25010 oscillates\n\nLooks like when I hit the power button every power rails are coming on except: <SIGNAL>CPU_VCORE</SIGNAL>.\n\nChecked <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> and Y2805. Y2805 does not oscillate. I changed both Y2805 and <CHIP>U2800</CHIP>.\n\nWhat could this be?\n\nThank you."
