        "message":"Hi,\n\nI received this macbook with not turning on issue.\nNo liquid damage. The board was pretty dusty. But no sing of liquid damage.\nWhen I press the power button the fan spins up a little bit and that's it. It does not do the on-off loop.\n\nHere are the measurements:\n\nPPBUS_G3H 12.57V\nPP3V3_S5 3.3V\nPP5V_S5 5V\nRTC_G3H - 3V\n32kHz present\nY25010 oscillates\n\nLooks like when I hit the power button every power rails are coming on except: CPU_VCORE.\n\nChecked U2800 and Y2805. Y2805 does not oscillate. I changed both Y2805 and U2800.\n\nWhat could this be?\n\nThank you."
