I tried known good bios (sourced from here in a previous thread)  according to the software successfully, and 2 new batteries; the problem persists. The board looks healthy, no visible signs of anything problematic. I can\u2019t think of where to begin checking for an issue. Aside from trying a different firmware chip potentially however I don\u2019t know for sure if that\u2019s the wisest next logical step."

Disconnecting J9600 led me to discover that if I disconnect it and intentionally let it fail to boot (with \u201c?\u201d folder, not loop) to the internal and then plug it back in it will boot to the internal and work fine until I turn it off at which point I have to disconnect it, allow it to fail to boot once, plug it back in and allow it to boot successfully. This pattern is consistent. I also allowed it to update hoping that it was something silly this was difficult as when the computer would restart during the update I would have to go through the process of disconnecting J9600 allowing it to fail and then plugging it back in to complete the update, after the update the problem persists; still have to disconnect, connect etc."

Very cool to have learned that, just as things seem too simple to be true: this may or may not be related but it may have been going on alongside original issue, just unable to notice because of the booting thing; \nNow it boots successfully each time without fail, but when you shut it down it will not turn on unless you do SMC reset or just unplug it and replug it, wether battery is plugged in or not doesn\u2019t matter. Selecting restart is also unsuccessful on the turn back on part. Idk if this should be a separate post ??"
