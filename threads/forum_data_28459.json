PP18V5_DCIN_FUSE goes from 0.3v to 1.8v then back down again. Q7085 gets quite hot. I replaced it but it made no difference. Advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated."}

There was indeed a short, in fact 2 shorts, at PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG on L7030 and PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR on Q7030.\n\nAfter replacing both I now get just a green light but no orange and no start up. PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG is still shorted even though I replaced L7030 with one that wasn't shorted on the donor board. When I removed it I checked both pads and no short so surely it was this component causing the short to the line? Does this component not like heat or something?"}

It is probably on pin 2 the system side. Inject voltage there, start low and monitor current draw. At 2-3 amps something should be heating up that is causing the short."}
