            "message": "Thanks Duke. There was indeed a short, in fact 2 shorts, at <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG</SIGNAL> on L7030 and <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR</SIGNAL> on <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR>.\n\nAfter replacing both I now get just a green light but no orange and no start up. <SIGNAL>PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG</SIGNAL> is still shorted even though I replaced L7030 with one that wasn't shorted on the donor board. When I removed it I checked both pads and no short so surely it was this component causing the short to the line? Does this component not like heat or something?"

Inject voltage there, start low and monitor current draw. At 2-3 amps something should be heating up that is causing the short."
