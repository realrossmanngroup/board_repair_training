I replaced it along with <RESISTOR>R6323</RESISTOR>/ <RESISTOR>R6332</RESISTOR> and now I get 3.3v on both sides of <RESISTOR>R6324</RESISTOR>.\n\nI also tried shorting pins 1 & 2 of the headphone socket to see if that would work as it did on a similar issue I had in the past but that didn't work either.\n\nI get 0v on both sides on L6607/08 with and without headphones plugged in.
