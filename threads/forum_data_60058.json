        "820-01598": "What is 820-01598? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",

        "PLT_RST_L": "What is PLT_RST_L? This is an abbreviation of “PLT_RESET_L” – when you see “PLT_RST_L\", assume the person meant to type PLT_RESET_L.",

PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is a power rail responsible for powering the part of the CPU responsible for communicating with other portions of the machine prior to PPVCORE_S0_CPU being present and must be present before vcore, PPVCCIO_S0_CPU is present when the machine is in an on, RUNNING state. .",

        "PPVCCSA_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCCSA_S0_CPU? Main power rail for the CPU. If this is missing the machine will act braindead. This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance – this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground.."

I tried by cleaning and replacing some damaged or rusted components and finely it start taking 120-150mAmp but no image and no chim. Then i got to know that <SIGNAL>CPUGT_PWM1</SIGNAL> and PWM2 are not present on <CHIP>U7410</CHIP> & <CHIP>U7420</CHIP>.\nThen i check <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> which looks good and also i removed it and soldered back but still nothing happens. What else i need to do?"
