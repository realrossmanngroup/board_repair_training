I tried by cleaning and replacing some damaged or rusted components and finely it start taking 120-150mAmp but no image and no chim. Then i got to know that CPUGT_PWM1 and PWM2 are not present on U7410 & U7420.\nThen i check U7100 which looks good and also i removed it and soldered back but still nothing happens. What else i need to do?"}
