        "820-00281": "What is 820-00281? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",

        "R7090": "What is R7090? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7009": "What is R7009? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO": "What is PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO? PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on..",
        "PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS": "What is PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS? PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS is 20v in from the USB-C charger on USB-C powered Macbook Pros..",
