There was also 2 missing diodes of the keyboard I2C lines but I have put these back already.\nOther than that, I can't find anything that looks funny or reworked.\n\nI am getting 20V and the board seems to turn on.\nI am getting all the expected voltages on the coils near the CPU but I am missing <SIGNAL>PVCCGT_S0</SIGNAL> which is for the graphic cores if I am not mistaken.\nI don't get a display on the internal display nor if an external display is connected.\n\nBoard turns on, gets 20V, seats around 0.5A and then goes back to 0A (which my known good board does not) then back to 0.5A and drops to 0.45A\nI've measured the resistance to ground on <SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0</SIGNAL> and I'm getting 2ohms, same with my known good board.\n\nHow to find out if I am getting the enable signal for that rail (<SIGNAL>PPVCCGT_S0</SIGNAL>)?\nIt's coming from the PMIC, correct?\n\nThat looks to me like a faulty CPU but I am wondering if I should give the PMIC a swap for the sake of trying (or a reflow first)?\nSounds like a good idea?"
