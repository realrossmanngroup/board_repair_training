        "message":"Hello,\n\nI have a 820-3332 MacBook that is kernel panic'ing. We did an SSD replacement because there were definitely some faults on it however the kernel panicking is still happening. I redid the solder on U8900 (ISL628) and even changed it, I also changed the SSD a second time, however the kernel panicking is still being reported by the customer. The panic report shows that it is not isolated to just one CPU core. It can happen on any. How should I go about troubleshooting this?\n\nThank you."
