It has the click so mechanically it seems fine, but it does nothing at any time. No visible damage or corrosion. The Touch ID is also giving a \"Fingerprint Limit Reached\" error even after running xartutil ?erase-all in Terminal but I'm not sure if that's related. Any idea where to start with this?"
