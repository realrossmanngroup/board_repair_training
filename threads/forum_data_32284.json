Not terrible though. I've gone through it and checked everything and replaced U7200. No CPU voltage. It's at .040V. No short on vcore. U7200 has HS_COMPUTING and 5V_S0 coming in. 3V3_S0 is also present on the board. Not sure what I should be looking for next to get CPU power."}

[\/I]If the CPU area were ht with corrosion there are two likelihoods.\n\n1) CPU has corrosion under it.\n2) CPU is dead.\n\nI would give it an ultrasonic at something very high like 80-85 celsius for a short time period like 30 seconds to get rid of any hard gunk that may be remaining. I would also check R7280 and R7279, the pullups on the data lines where U7200 is told what to create for the CPU.\n\nAfter that, I would toss in the towel. This is obviously assuming pins 16\/17 of U7200 are receiving the voltage they are supposed to."}
