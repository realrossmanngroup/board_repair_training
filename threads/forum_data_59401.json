        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "D7005": "What is D7005? a DIODE.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "C7090": "What is C7090? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C7092": "What is C7092? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C7091": "What is C7091? a CAPACITOR.",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H? PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H is the input voltage to the PP3V42_G3H buck converter circuit, it can be either charger voltage or battery voltage depending on what the system power source is. This often shorts to ground when one of the input capacitors dies. .",

I tested with New <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> without <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> it gives me roughly 20v on both ends. As soon I Install <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> , <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> blows out. \nNO sign of Liquid damage on motherboard. <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is also not short to ground, I checkd on F7140. I removed these components <CAPACITOR>C7090</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7091</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7092</CAPACITOR>, <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>   after <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> no sign of short. Could't figure out what is shorting. I replaced new chip also <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> still didn't solved my issue. I also replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> for no reason.\nNow I need help where should I look.\nThanks in Advanced"
