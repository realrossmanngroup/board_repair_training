            "message": "hi, on my previous post I had asked about a no backlight issue on the same <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board. well before i could figure what the issue was the board decided to randomly blow a capacitor taking the <CHIP>U9410</CHIP> 3.3v/HV POWER MUX CHIP along with it so i replaced the blown capacitor along with the <CHIP>U9410</CHIP> chip. Now i only get a green light all power rails except S0 are enabled. after doing a lot of troubleshooting i believe the issue lies in between the <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> which may be causing no <SIGNAL>1V5CPU_EN</SIGNAL> which is not letting the 1.5v S3/S0 FET to enable.\n\nSo ive come to ask for some help and guidance. Thanks."
