        "R7121": "What is R7121? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

I pretty much assumed there would be no green light, and didn't want to plug the board in until replacing <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>. I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> together, and had no green light. I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>, and got a green light, but no power. I checked <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and it was 0v (at F7140). I made sure the fuse wasn't blown, but there's nothing at either pin of L7130 either, so PPBUS is definitely missing. I poked around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and found <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR>/7122 blown, so I replaced both of them. Still no <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. I found that <RESISTOR>R7185</RESISTOR> was reading as 0ohm when it should be 470k, so I replaced it but the replacement reads 0ohm in-circuit as well (and 470k out of circuit, so it's fine). So is something pulling down the resistance of this resistor? It measures properly on another working board. I have <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, and have a steady green --> orange light. No shorts detected (on <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>), and nothing getting warm otherwise.\n\nSort of lost at this point; I checked all other main resistors around <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, and they all look/measure fine. I have proper voltages at pin 3 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>. Do I need to replace <TRANSISTOR>Q7155</TRANSISTOR>? Does this type of damage (from a cheap/chinese charger) typically take out more than just <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>/<TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and current-sense resistors? I'm not sure what else to check. I've replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> twice to be safe, but same results each time.\n\nAll help appreciated."

I replaced <CAPACITOR>C7185</CAPACITOR> and removed <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>, and the resistor is measuring properly now.\n- I have a short on <CAPACITOR>C7120</CAPACITOR>, pins 1 and 2. I know pin 2 is ground, but it looks like pin 1 might be shorted by <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>.\n\nQuestion; if <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR> were bad, would it have killed <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>? I will replace both to be sure, but is there a chance that I would also need to re-replace <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> in all of this? I obviously want to make sure I don't get stuck in a circle of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> killing my fets then them killing my <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>; should I just replace all three at once? I'm not sure if <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> would kill <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> due to damage from <TRANSISTOR>Q7180</TRANSISTOR>. I'm not sure how all of those work together and affect each other."
