        "message":"MacBook had liquid damage.\nIt stayed at 5V.\n\nCD301 and pad on the board was melted. CD301 and UB300 has been replaced.\nBoard had CD3215C00Z and used C00 (is that still OK?)\nOne USB C port had burned pin ports on one side has been replaced.\n\nGot 20V, board works, charge battery etc and now the funny stuff..\nWithout charger any USB device works, it is visible in the macOS etc. but as soon I connect charger it just fries that USB device. Looks like instead 5V board send 20V?"
