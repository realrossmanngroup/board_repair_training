However when removing the last one on the top right. I actually removed the middle ground pad. Not a bad thing but made me resolder it again 3 times. I think now its perfectly working.\n\nThe problem is that I actually melted by accident the component right besides it L9360, which I also do not have the same from my donor boards. Is it possible to use another component?\n\nI do have donor boards of the 820-2936 \/ 820-3115 \/ 820-3023 \/ 820-3024 \/ 820-4668\n\nImages attached below for better reference"}
