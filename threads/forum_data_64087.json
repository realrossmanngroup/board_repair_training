        "message":"Hi there. This Macbook came in with no power. Stuck at 5V on both USB-C ports and hovers between 40mA and 26mA, never gets to 20V. . I believe it was a cheap power cable that caused this.\n\nBoard is 820-00840. PPBUS_G3H is missing, all other necessary voltages appear to be present. There are no shorts on any main power lines.\n\nI have replaced:\n\nBoth CD3215's\nBoth Q3100 & Q3200\nU8210\nU7000 (twice)\n\nChecked all resistors around U7000 and all seem within spec.\n\nPlease help."
