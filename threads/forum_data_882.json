Found out that the last prosent was corrosion on the motherboards flex cables pins and did not connect in one pins. Solderd the pin back where it belong and now it works like a charm without any issues. Thanks everybody! :)"

In some cases when I didn't have a dc in flex for an older air and a customer was an impatient fuck I would run all the wires from the mainboard using magnet wire to the dc in board to freshly soldered onewire circuitry... fun times. :-)"
