Testing with known-good trackpad and cable plugged in. 5V is present going to <CHIP>U5805</CHIP>. Boost circuit is not working. <SIGNAL>Z2_BOOST_EN</SIGNAL> is at 0.043V. The boost circuit area looks clean. <RESISTOR>R5811</RESISTOR> is measuring fine at 100KÎ©. Any thoughts on why <SIGNAL>Z2_BOOST_EN</SIGNAL> is not coming on?"

            "message": "Firstly trackpad function and trackpad sensor are totally different, even though they both go to the trackpad. You can have a working trackpad with a bad TS0P sensor, and you can have a trackpad that doesn't track but with TS0P sensor working. TS0P sensor failing is what causes fan to be on high.\n\nWhat is the history of the board? Water, drop, DIY repair? What is diode mode measurement on pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R5806</RESISTOR>, red probe ground, black probe on pin 2(no power applied of course)? \n\nThis is usually caused from trackpad not being detected sometimes from beat up connector, or <RESISTOR>R5806</RESISTOR> being ripped off by fingernail."
