        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",
        "PPVCC_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCC_S0_CPU? The \"PPVCC_S0_CPU\" power rail is responsible for supplying power to the CPU when the MacBook is fully on, or in the S0 state. This rail is one of the main voltages that the CPU requires for operation. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",

It's an active-low signal that, when asserted (low voltage), indicates the system should enter or is in the S3 sleep state. .",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "PP3V3_S3": "What is PP3V3_S3? a SIGNAL.",
        "S4_PWR_EN": "What is S4_PWR_EN? S4_PWR_EN turns on the S4 power rails. Signals ending in _EN enable whatever came before _EN in the signal name when the voltage of the signal is high. .",
