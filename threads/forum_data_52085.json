        "R7121": "What is R7121? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

Thanks!\n\nWhat turns on Y1905 on <CHIP>U1900</CHIP>?\nI totally get I was down a rabbit hole.\n\nI pulled out the Thermal and did find a hot spot.\n<CHIP>U1930</CHIP>. It was not making good voltage on the output. There was no sign of water. Checked for shorts found none. Replaced <CHIP>U1930</CHIP>. When chip was pulled there was no sign of water. Hot spot gone. Now the board is pulling 0.15A and still nothing.\n\nbut... If I quick bounce the MagSafe it will go into S0 and does power up all the way to a question mark on the screen.\n\nBack to power rail checking.\nNow 3V3 S5 at L7560 is 0.5v unless I quick bounce MagSafe. checking that now.\n\nThe problem with the 3V3 S5 and having to bounce the MagSafe was <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> not coming up to proper voltage.  Each time you quick bounced it would rise a little then slowly fall. Traced that back to <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> <RESISTOR>R7121</RESISTOR> & <RESISTOR>R7122</RESISTOR>.  \n\nI now have a working board!!!!!!\nThanks for getting me out of my hole.   \n\nI am still am curious about Y1905  powering on.
