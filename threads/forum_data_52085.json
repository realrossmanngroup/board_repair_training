I know that I am kind of new at this but OMG this board is a bitch!\nI did discover some water damage around U7501 but this area has been worked twice now and my 3V3_S5 rail is good.\n\nMagSafe light good\nPP3V3 S5 good\n\nP3V3SUS_EN Bad\nSYSCLK_CLK25M X1 & X2 missing ( Y1905 crystal is doing noting. Occasional weird pulse no sine wave )\nU1900 & Y1905 replaced. (because I am mentally lazy)\n\nU1900 VDD Good 3.3V\nU1900 PP3V42_G3H good 3.3V\nU1900 P3V3_S5RS3RS0_SYSCLKGEN good 3.3V\nU1900 PPVRTC_G3H output good 3.3V\nU1900 PP3V3 S5 rail input good 3.3V\n\nU1900 PP3V3 TBTLC missing Voltage is 0.45v I checked for shorts. I am not totally sure what the hell TBTLC means. I seems to be power for U2890 and U2060\nU1900 PP1V2_CAM_XTALPCIEVDD missing. I don't care about a camera right?\nU1900 PCH_CLK32K_RTCX1 missing. \"as to be expected in this state\"\n\nI have checked all the local resistors\nis it possible that my harvested crystal is also bad? I never see these fail unless dropped.\n\nI just don't have enough experience in this area. Would appreciate guidance.\nI have tried to find a data sheet on this chip without success.\n\nI think I am in a rabbit hole and lost!"}

Thanks!\n\nWhat turns on Y1905 on U1900?\nI totally get I was down a rabbit hole.\n\nI pulled out the Thermal and did find a hot spot.\nU1930. It was not making good voltage on the output. There was no sign of water. Checked for shorts found none. Replaced U1930. When chip was pulled there was no sign of water. Hot spot gone. Now the board is pulling 0.15A and still nothing.\n\nbut... If I quick bounce the MagSafe it will go into S0 and does power up all the way to a question mark on the screen.\n\nBack to power rail checking.\nNow 3V3 S5 at L7560 is 0.5v unless I quick bounce MagSafe. checking that now.\n\nThe problem with the 3V3 S5 and having to bounce the MagSafe was PPBUS_G3H not coming up to proper voltage.  Each time you quick bounced it would rise a little then slowly fall. Traced that back to U7100 R7121 & R7122.  \n\nI now have a working board!!!!!!\nThanks for getting me out of my hole.   \n\nI am still am curious about Y1905  powering on.   I just cant find a data sheet on U1900."}
