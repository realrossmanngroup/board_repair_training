Located a partial short on PP4V5_AUDIO_ANALOG, caused by U6201.\nAfter replacing U6201 I got sound again with speakers but when i connect headphones to the audio jack i just get some deep \"clicking noises\" but no sound at all...\nThe macbook detects the headphones (in die sound settings).\n\nThank you"}
