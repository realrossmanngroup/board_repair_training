Located a partial short on <SIGNAL>PP4V5_AUDIO_ANALOG</SIGNAL>, caused by <CHIP>U6201</CHIP>.\nAfter replacing <CHIP>U6201</CHIP> I got sound again with speakers but when i connect headphones to the audio jack i just get some deep \"clicking noises\" but no sound at all...\nThe macbook detects the headphones (in die sound settings).\n\nThank you"
