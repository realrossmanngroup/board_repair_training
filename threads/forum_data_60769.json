Haven't solved it yet, I'll come back at it in a while. Voltage measurements showed some discrepencies compared to a known good board on the audio jack analog outputs, one of them is also used for jack detection when shorted to one jack detect line IIRC. In my case the jack itself looks fine (and static resistance/diode mode measurements look fine too) and replacing the audio codec IC didn't make any difference. Will keep you updated if I get more info on this."

Almost fully working but the audio jack… Internal speakers work fine. Headphones won't get detected unless I put the machine to sleep and wake it up. But headphone output is distorted, more on the left channel btw. It \"pops\" when audio codec wakes up/goes to sleep, pretty much when DC gets sent out. Sure enough, it looks like there's 2VDC on both channels. Replaced the audio codec IC, same thing. There's also 2VDC on HPREF, which I assume is what causes 2VDC on the output.

I cut the trace just before TP[1]<SIGNAL>HPAMP_REF</SIGNAL> to isolate the audio codec IC, I now have 3V on the audio codec IC HPREF pin and 0V on the rest of the line. Now it's stuck in optical out.
