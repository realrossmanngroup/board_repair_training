        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "820-00165": "What is 820-00165? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP5V0_S0": "What is PP5V0_S0? a SIGNAL.",
        "U8080": "What is U8080? a CHIP.",
        "U3210": "What is U3210? a CHIP.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "P5VS0_EN": "What is P5VS0_EN? This signal enables the PP5V_S0 power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

        "U1950": "What is U1950? This chip often becomes corroded on pin 8 on the PP3V42_G3H pin causing PM_SLP_S4_L to go missing.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. ."

Initially found liquid damage on <CHIP>U3210</CHIP> and near <CAPACITOR>C3286</CAPACITOR>. replaced it and cleaned. \nbut there was still no life. i can notice a pulse when switch on the power supply. current goes to normal 350-400mAmp just for 0.5 second then goes to zero and again one more pulse after 1 -2 sec and jump upto 200mAmp. after that no activity.\n\nI removed <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> and notice presence of <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> which is stable at 5V. tried replacing <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> but no change. found <SIGNAL>P5VS0_EN</SIGNAL> absent and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> also absent.\n\ni removed <CHIP>U8080</CHIP> and got  <SIGNAL>P5VS0_EN</SIGNAL> , <SIGNAL>PP5V_S4RS3</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL>  present.  tried to trace down <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> to find the problem but could not find any.\nplease suggest what could be the possible solution.\n\nthank you"
