The one looping is the closest one to the screen which I believe is controlled by U3200.\n\nAll other voltages are looping including PP3V3_G3H when connected on that port.\n\nWhen power supplied to the closest to the trackpad port, some of the measurements are:\n\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.3V\nTBA_HPWR_EN_L - 3.3V\nPM_EN_P3V3_G3H - 5V\nSMC_RESET_R_L - 3.3V\nPPDCIN_G3H - 5V\n\nThanks"}
