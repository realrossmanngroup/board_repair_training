The one looping is the closest one to the screen which I believe is controlled by <CHIP>U3200</CHIP>.\n\nAll other voltages are looping including <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> when connected on that port.\n\nWhen power supplied to the closest to the trackpad port, some of the measurements are:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>TBA_HPWR_EN_L</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PM_EN_P3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> - 5V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_R_L</SIGNAL> - 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> - 5V\n\nThanks"
