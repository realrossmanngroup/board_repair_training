Nothing gets hot.\n\nSo now when I plug any wattage charger in I see green \/ orange and the OS knows and shows the charger is connected. But it's not charging. The battery is fine."}

Replaced it and issue resolved.\n\nEdit: Just saw you said you replaced it; check continuity for all traces for these components, and make sure ISL is soldered well."}
