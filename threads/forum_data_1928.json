Is PPBUS_G3H a steady 8.5v now? Is the machine in an S0 state, meaning S0 rails are present?"}

Q2820 is going to short PM_MEM_PWRGD to ground if voltage on pin 2 is too high. \n\nSo what is PM_MEM_PWRGD_L measuring? This means PM_MEM_PWRGD is present when the signal is LOW, so when it's HIGH it will short it to ground."}
