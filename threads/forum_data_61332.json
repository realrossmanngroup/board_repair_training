I replaced some corroded resistors and the machine starts up and functions normally. Except that any time an audio signal is produced, the left speaker buzzes audibly for a few seconds, then goes quiet. Startup chime, system alert sound, any audio will produce the temporary buzz. Any pointers as to where I should look?"
