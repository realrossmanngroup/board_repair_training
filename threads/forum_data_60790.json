When I plug it in I got 12V for a moment, slowly dropping to 0.4V.\nI got a green light on the charger, <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is stable.\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> is okay\n<SIGNAL>CHGR_RST_L</SIGNAL> is okay.\nCurrent sening seems okay.\nI already replaced <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7130</TRANSISTOR> and removed F7140 with the same result.\n\nThank you for your help.\nDudi"
