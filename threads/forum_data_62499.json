        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

        "PCH_DSWVRMEN": "What is PCH_DSWVRMEN? DSWVRMEN stands for DeepSx Well On-Die Voltage Regulator Enable. This signal enables the internal DSW 1.05 V regulators and must be always pulled-up to PPVRTC_G3H 3.3 volts.\nIf this signal is not being asserted (i.e., not enabled), the on-die voltage regulators responsible for supplying power in deep sleep states may not be active. This could lead to the MacBook failing to exit from a deep sleep state or having issues when trying to enter one, contributing to a scenario where the device does not power on.\n\nIf the signal is not present or not at the correct levels, it could indicate a problem with the Platform Controller Hub (PCH) itself..",

Charger I'm using is a 85W magsafe 2 (straight from the wall not through a bench PSU) bought and used on two 3437s I was trying to fix so that should not be the issue.\n\nBoard looks spotless zero signs of liquid damage or corrosion, or even blown components (besides <CAPACITOR>C7380</CAPACITOR> was cracked but not shorted rail was still present).\n\nBelow are the rails I've checked:\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.43V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> 12.57\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING</SIGNAL> = 12.25V\n<SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> = 5V\n<SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> = 3.39V\n\nEverything looked normal until I got to: \n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER5V</SIGNAL> = 12.56v. Schematic says it should be 8.6v.\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER3V3</SIGNAL> = Same as <SIGNAL>PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER5V</SIGNAL>.\n\nI then checked: \nPM_SLP_S5_Lcompletely 0 no pulse\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL> ditto\n<SIGNAL>S4_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> = 0V\n\nIs <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> used in the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>? I read a article while researching why it would be missing that most macbooks do not use this rail hence it's disappearance is usually a non issue. That said I did find another post on here where they were also missing <SIGNAL>S5_L</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>S4_L</SIGNAL> & were requested to note the below rails: \n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_ADAPTER_EN</SIGNAL> = 3.4V\n<SIGNAL>PM_BATLOW_L</SIGNAL> = 0V\n<SIGNAL>S5_PWRGD</SIGNAL> =  3.35V\n<SIGNAL>PCH_SRTCRST_L</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PCH_INTVRMEN</SIGNAL> = 3.24V \n<SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL> = 3.3v\n<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> = 3.3V\n<SIGNAL>PCH_DSWVRMEN</SIGNAL> = 2.96V\n<SIGNAL>PM_DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL> 3.43V\n\nThey were also asked if they trigger <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>  if  <SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> changes. \n<SIGNAL>PM_PWRBTN_L</SIGNAL> 3.42 on normal state 0V after shorting <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL>. I also checked if <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4</SIGNAL>/<SIGNAL>S5_L</SIGNAL> pulse when first connecting the magsafe with <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> triggered and it did not both stayed at 0V.\n\nIs there a way to check if the SMC is OK? I'm starting to suspect the SMC but unfortunately I do not have any replacements. and no <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1502</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> donor boards. Are the 3437 or 00165 SMCs compatible?\n\nThanks for your assistance."
