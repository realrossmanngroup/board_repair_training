Anyways I threw it into a working case and no chime, no display. fan still spins. I put under thermal cam and <CHIP>U1800</CHIP> seems a little hot. its around 60-70c I know the cpu's do get Real hot on these but not sure if this helps in anyway. Would there still be fan spins if CPU was not good?"
