If it still doesnt work, Take the edge bonding off the SMC and give it a reflow with flux and some heat. See if it works and go from there."

In previous post you said <SIGNAL>G2_EN</SIGNAL> was present so at that point the SMC was running so something has been messed up or your recalling is no good. Check for knocked off components around SMC and check your recalling method. This is certainly a problem in the SMC area."
