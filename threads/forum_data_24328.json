Thanks in advance!\n\n\nNo LD visible upon receipt.\n\nD7012 was knocked off. replaced and restored pp3v42_g3h green\/orange light.\n\nBegan checking rails and of course everything is present up to PP5V_S4_RS3 whose enable signal at pin 4 of u7501 is sitting at .86v which is what pm_slp_s4_l is reading \"up stream\" and across the board. checked p\/u resistors and any along the path of pm_slp_s4_l, they are within spec.

I read a reply that Louis posted on a similar situation (1v) where he stated that 1v is not a \"valid\" reading.
