This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

            "message": "Hi 2informaticos and the rest of you nice people :)\n\nWell here I am again with my favorite nightmare board , the 3332 ....\nThis time i have a board with some oxidation and no green light at all ....\nNo liquid damage noticed (the sensors still white) , while checking it out on the microscope i noticed that the <RESISTOR>R6920</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> are blown , so I thought this will be one easy one :) (optimistic ha ) \nreplaced those two and connected the charger to see if all is ok now , and as you might guess it was NOT :)\nThe <RESISTOR>R6920</RESISTOR> tried to communicate with me the old indian way , sending me smokesignals just before it died , puffff \nThe <RESISTOR>R6905</RESISTOR> didnt but that is probably because the battery wasnt connected .... \nRemoved the <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> and replaced it thinking that might solve the problem , it didnt . Checked the <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> for short and it seems ok , only the pin 5 goes to ground ....\nOn pin 1 of the <RESISTOR>R6920</RESISTOR> i do get 18.5 V so that side seems ok so my problem must be on the other side unfortunately .\nOn the <DIODE>D6905</DIODE> pin 3 in diode mode i get 0.213 and on pin 2 on L6995 in diode mode i get 0.315 V ....\nAnd there I am stuck .... any help is highly apreciated \nThanks in advance"
