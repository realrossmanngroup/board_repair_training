Checked the U6990 for short and it seems ok , only the pin 5 goes to ground ....\nOn pin 1 of the R6920 i do get 18.5 V so that side seems ok so my problem must be on the other side unfortunately .\nOn the D6905 pin 3 in diode mode i get 0.213 and on pin 2 on L6995 in diode mode i get 0.315 V ....\nAnd there I am stuck .... any help is highly apreciated \nThanks in advance"}
