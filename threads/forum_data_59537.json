        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP20V_USBC": "What is PP20V_USBC? 20 volt power rail that comes directly from the charger.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC": "What is PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC? PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing/charging chip. This can be shorted to ground by the capacitor on its line, and when this happens, the chip can stop functioning which causes the charger to not turn on. This can also be missing if the CD3215 chip itself is bad..",
        "PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC": "What is PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC? PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing chip. When this is missing, either a capacitor on the line has shorted, PP3V3_G3H is missing, or the CD3215 is bad..",
        "BUF_SMC_RESET_L": "What is BUF_SMC_RESET_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "TBA_VDDA": "What is TBA_VDDA? a SIGNAL.",

Also replace <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. I've reflashed a clean ME and also a complete BIOS. Still not powering up. \n\nHere are the readings i have so far:\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL>: 3.4\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>: 3.4\n<SIGNAL>BUF_SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL>.: 3.4\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>: -0.13 (yeah these readings were erratic. I confirmed on oscope, it is generating negative voltage). On one instance, i had 0.3V reading. \n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> Diode mode: 0.43\n<SIGNAL>TBA_VDDA</SIGNAL>: 5.2\n<SIGNAL>TBA_VDDP</SIGNAL>: 5.2\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC</SIGNAL>: 0\n<SIGNAL>PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC</SIGNAL>: 0\n\nAny suggestions."
