        "820-00850": "What is 820-00850? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",

        "U6903": "What is U6903? This chip is responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H in 2016-2018 model Macbook logic boards.",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "CHGR_EN_MVR_R": "What is CHGR_EN_MVR_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",

Mount board on a good top case with battery, connect power button, connect keyboard and trackpad connect/screw battery\n\n2. If you are looking at the keyboard as if you were about to type I connected the charger and USB-C cable to the top left USB-C port\n\n3. Also connected an USB-C Belkin cable on the USB-C port below that one, that same cable I connected to a 2016 15\" MPB on the same port location but also tried the other port on the left side with no luck.\n\n4. I opened up Apple Configurator App\n\n5. Pressed and held down Power-Right Side Shift-Left Side Control and Option keys for more than 10 seconds.\n\nBut nothing happens on the Apple Configurator App.\n\nAbout to do the rest you are suggesting."
