Mount board on a good top case with battery, connect power button, connect keyboard and trackpad connect\/screw battery\n\n2. If you are looking at the keyboard as if you were about to type I connected the charger and USB-C cable to the top left USB-C port\n\n3. Also connected an USB-C Belkin cable on the USB-C port below that one, that same cable I connected to a 2016 15\" MPB on the same port location but also tried the other port on the left side with no luck.\n\n4. I opened up Apple Configurator App\n\n5. Pressed and held down Power-Right Side Shift-Left Side Control and Option keys for more than 10 seconds.\n\nBut nothing happens on the Apple Configurator App.\n\nAbout to do the rest you are suggesting."
