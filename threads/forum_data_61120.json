        "message":"Hi\nMacbook Air 820-01521-2 has no display with battery. i have checked with different battery also but got same response. i am getting display on external and internal both without battery.\nthere is no liquid split sign on board or damaged component. Also checked with two different good screens.\nUSB meter shows 1-2 Amp when plug in with battery. it seems, it try to turn on but soon goes to 0 Amp and start taking heavy current(1.5 Amp approx.) looks like charging battery. Tried PRAM reset.\nAlso not able to login the device. it get stuck at login screen after entering the password and stays at login screen for hours. after that start rebooting at apple logo ion every 5 sec.\nWhat could be the problem? i have no idea where to start.\n\nThanks"
