        "A1932": "What is A1932? A1932 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Late 2018, 2019 with EMC 3184, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01521..",
        "820-01521": "What is 820-01521? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_DCIN": "What is SMC_DCIN? a SIGNAL.",
        "BMON_ISENSE": "What is BMON_ISENSE? a SIGNAL.",
        "C7020": "What is C7020? Capacitor between current sense lines on ISL6259 chip for charger current sensing, you should measure around 20.02 ohms across this. Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

This is NOT shorted to ground if it has a low resistance â€“ this is a common mistake people make. A chip that requires high power at a low voltage like a CPU or GPU will have a low measured resistance to ground..",

Also checked with two different good screens.\nUSB meter shows 1-2 Amp when plug in with battery. it seems, it try to turn on but soon goes to 0 Amp and start taking heavy current(1.5 Amp approx.) looks like charging battery. Tried PRAM reset.\nAlso not able to login the device. it get stuck at login screen after entering the password and stays at login screen for hours. after that start rebooting at apple logo ion every 5 sec.\nWhat could be the problem? i have no idea where to start.\n\nThanks"
