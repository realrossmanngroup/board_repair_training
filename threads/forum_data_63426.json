It measures 10.9 volts most of the time, but in short 3-4 second bursts it holds at 12v and in some cases 13v - battery connected. It stays 12.3 volts or sometimes 13 volts when battery disconnected. I have disconnected all parts such as trackpad, keyboard, Touch Bar, etc.\n\nWith a known good working battery, PPBUS_G3H measures 12.3 volts and in short bursts every now and then it measures 13 volts.\n\nDiode mode:\nPPBUS_G3H - 0.377\n\nCharger shows 20v - 0 amps. Unable to connect to Apple Configurator 2 - tried many different cables, Macs, etc.\n\nEdit: Most of the time charger shows 20v - 0 amps, sometimes it shows 0.43 amps and then cycles back to 0."}
