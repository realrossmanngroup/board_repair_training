        "message":"I have 820-00138 and it doesn't give me an image but works perfect on external monitor so i checked the connector pins on the schematics and looks so confusing compared withe the other boards and also i have to use board view file similar to that board because is not available yet. Anyway i have 5v on pin 28 to 30 i also have power on pin 54v on 1 i have voltage on pin 3 but pin 8 i don't have anything that's LCS_BKLT_PWM_R so i believe that's the brightness and its coming from EDP_IG_BKL_PWM and thats coming from U1100 if im right. Any ideas ?"
