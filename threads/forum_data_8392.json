Anyway i have 5v on pin 28 to 30 i also have power on pin 54v on 1 i have voltage on pin 3 but pin 8 i don't have anything that's <SIGNAL>LCS_BKLT_PWM_R</SIGNAL> so i believe that's the brightness and its coming from <SIGNAL>EDP_IG_BKL_PWM</SIGNAL> and thats coming from <CHIP>U1100</CHIP> if im right. Any ideas ?"
