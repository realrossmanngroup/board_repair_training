Now both <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> boards right fans aren't working. I've confirmed the below voltages are present.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL>\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S0</SIGNAL>\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_FAN_1_CTL</SIGNAL> voltage is at 0.0034V and not increasing.\n\nAlso performed resistance check and compared to the left side, both match. \n\nI swapped out the smc twice on one of the board with the same results (confirmed pads for fan control was good). \n\nHas anyone experienced this and what what did you find was the issue?\n\nThanks."
