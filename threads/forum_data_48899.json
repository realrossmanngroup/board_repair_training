I'm assuming the slowness is related to <CHIP>U2600</CHIP>. Also, had a slightly corroded through hole on <SIGNAL>PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC</SIGNAL> near SMC. Fluxed SMC and heated to 190 degrees for 10 seconds. I don't have a replacement for <CHIP>U2600</CHIP> and would like to know if this would cause the slowness.\n\nPPBUS at 12.53v with charger plugged in, around 11.7v currently with 70% charged batt by itself."

Also, tried another good trackpad/flex and seems maybe a little faster but still lags, using 2 good SSDs and both are slow. I did notice that an SMC Reset wont stay shut down, it automatically starts the mac again. I guess it may be the SMC or the components around it?"
