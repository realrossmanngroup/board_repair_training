I disabled TB, repaired ENET and FW, and replaced most of BL. I'm assuming the slowness is related to u2600. Also, had a slightly corroded through hole on PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC near SMC. Fluxed SMC and heated to 190 degrees for 10 seconds. I don't have a replacement for U2600 and would like to know if this would cause the slowness.\n\nPPBUS at 12.53v with charger plugged in, around 11.7v currently with 70% charged batt by itself."}

Also, tried another good trackpad\/flex and seems maybe a little faster but still lags, using 2 good SSDs and both are slow. I did notice that an SMC Reset wont stay shut down, it automatically starts the mac again. I guess it may be the SMC or the components around it?"}
