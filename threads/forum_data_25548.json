        "ALL_SYS_PWRGD": "What is ALL_SYS_PWRGD? ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present when PP1V8_S3, PP5V_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP1V05_S0, PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0, & PP1V5_S0 are present and working. If any of these rails is not working, ALL_SYS_PWRGD will be pulled down and the machine will not turn on. .",
        "PPVCORE_S0_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_S0_CPU? This is the primary power rail for the CPU that powers the CPU, known as CPU vcore. Without this, the machine will be braindead. .",
        "U7400": "What is U7400? a CHIP.",
        "ALL_SYS": "What is ALL_SYS? This is a typo of ALL_SYS_PWRGD When you see ALL_SYS, assume they meant to type ALL_SYS_PWRGD.",
        "R7402": "What is R7402? Resistor between PPVIN_S0_CPUIMVP and CPUIMVP_TON. TON stands for TIME ON â€“ CPUIMVP_TON configures the buck converter for the CPU based on its input power supply. If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. ."
