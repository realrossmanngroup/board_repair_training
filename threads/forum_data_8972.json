I don't understand what type of failure I'm looking at (I've been working on boards for 6 months); all of my regulators (<SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_AXG_PGOOD</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>P1V8S0_PGOOD</SIGNAL>, <SIGNAL>P5V3V3_PGOOD</SIGNAL>, CPUVCCIOS0_PGOOD, and <SIGNAL>PVCCSA_PGOOD</SIGNAL>) are measuring .05v, when they should be 3.3v. At <RESISTOR>R7967</RESISTOR>, I get 3.3v on pin 1 and .05v on pin 2 (of course). Resistor measures good. Diode mode reading is within 5% of a known-good board.\n\nAll of these regulators seem to be created in different areas (<CHIP>U7400</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7760</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>). I've replaced <CHIP>U7600</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7200</CHIP>, <CHIP>U7100</CHIP>, and the others seem to be working fine. Enables and power voltages to each IC seem fine. For example, I have my enables and vin for <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> (compared to a good board, the measurements are the same), but I get 0v at pin 23 of <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> (my <SIGNAL>P5V3V3_PGOOD</SIGNAL>). What could be making all of these regulators stay low? I don't detect any shorts or weird things via diode mode compared to a working board.\n\nI'll be sending this one off to be repaired unless you guys have any other ideas. Thanks!"
