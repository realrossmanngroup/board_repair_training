I don't understand what type of failure I'm looking at (I've been working on boards for 6 months); all of my regulators (CPUIMVP_AXG_PGOOD, P1V8S0_PGOOD, P5V3V3_PGOOD, CPUVCCIOS0_PGOOD, and PVCCSA_PGOOD) are measuring .05v, when they should be 3.3v. At R7967, I get 3.3v on pin 1 and .05v on pin 2 (of course). Resistor measures good. Diode mode reading is within 5% of a known-good board.\n\nAll of these regulators seem to be created in different areas (U7400, U7760, U7200, U7600, U7100). I've replaced U7600, U7200, U7100, and the others seem to be working fine. Enables and power voltages to each IC seem fine. For example, I have my enables and vin for U7200 (compared to a good board, the measurements are the same), but I get 0v at pin 23 of U7200 (my p5v3v3_pgood). What could be making all of these regulators stay low? I don't detect any shorts or weird things via diode mode compared to a working board.\n\nI'll be sending this one off to be repaired unless you guys have any other ideas. Thanks!"}
