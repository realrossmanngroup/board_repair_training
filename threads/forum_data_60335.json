        "SMC_FAN_0_CTL": "What is SMC_FAN_0_CTL? SMC_FAN_0_CTL is a line between the SMC and the fan that controls fan speed that is frequently disturbed when someone inexperienced knocks resistors in the area off with their fingernail or screwdriver when unplugging the fan. .",
        "SMC_FAN_0_TACH": "What is SMC_FAN_0_TACH? SMC_FAN_0_TACH is a signal that comes from the SMC that controls fan speed. Often when the fan is spinning too fast it is because the user has ripped off a resistor that this signal goes through before the signal reaches the fan while unplugging the fan..",

No liquid damage on SMC\n\nTried SMC reset, no change\n\nShorted <RESISTOR>R6061</RESISTOR> and Fan blasts to 100% with a 2-5 sec delay after shorting it. \n\n[ATTACH]59533[/ATTACH]"
