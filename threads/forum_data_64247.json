I compared it to another Mac with the exact same specs and it throttles to about 30% of CPU capacity in matter of minutes while the other one lasts hours and only gets to about 70% throttle.\n\nI changed thermal paste, changed the copper plate, tried with an external OS. The battery works fine, adapter is 87w OEM. There are no other software running in the background. Fans run at max.\n\nAll temperature sensors are all right except for the CPU ones which go for about 90 C"}, {"post_id": 101933, "thread_id": 64247, "title": "<s>[INST] [LOGIC_BOARD_PART_NUMBERS]820-00281[/LOGIC_BOARD_PART_NUMBERS]: Board part number 820-00281 fits a MacBook Pro Retina computer from year Late 2016 whose model number is <s>[INST] [MACBOOK_MODEL_NUMBERS]A1707[/MACBOOK_MODEL_NUMBERS]: A1707 is a model number for a 15\" size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3072, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00281, 820-00928.
