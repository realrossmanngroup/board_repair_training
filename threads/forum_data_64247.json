        "message":"Hello, i have a 820-00281 that throttles very fast. I compared it to another Mac with the exact same specs and it throttles to about 30% of CPU capacity in matter of minutes while the other one lasts hours and only gets to about 70% throttle.\n\nI changed thermal paste, changed the copper plate, tried with an external OS. The battery works fine, adapter is 87w OEM. There are no other software running in the background. Fans run at max.\n\nAll temperature sensors are all right except for the CPU ones which go for about 90 C"
