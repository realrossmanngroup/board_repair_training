Board: 820-3023\nWhen I press power no video, but I can see how mouse light up for 2 seg and off and on and off again and so on. I check the board and found cracked ram. Could be that the problem?\n\nRam is written: J2108BCSE-DJ-F\n1148R937F90\n\nAlso I cannot find where to buy this ram. All board from aliexpress comes without ram chips. Any idea?"}
