So I removed f7040 put my power supply on 12v and placed it on pin 2 of f7040 so that should now rule out anything on isl as being an issue am I right? If not.

I have replaced the resistor and cap we spoke of now I have [B]<SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S4_L</SIGNAL>[/B]\nTurning on with fan spins then off when the fan stops. As i under stand this is the enable signal for <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>\nIt also acer power cycling for a minute or 2 the fans spin full speed. im gonna look around.
