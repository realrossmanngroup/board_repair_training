            "message": "Board has slight liquid damage on <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> chip (photo). I’ve replaced the chip itself (CD3217B12) and other SMD components around, checked resistances and traces - all fine. Computer is turning on and working, but does not charge the battery (doesn’t even detect charger connected). With battery disconnected it takes 5V and ~ 0,30A, doesn't switch to 20V. With battery connected it swiches to 20V but takes constant ~0.024A. PPBUS without battery is 12,26V, with battery is 11,22V. I have replaced <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> again as well as <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. <RESISTOR>R7061</RESISTOR>/2 are fine. <SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT</SIGNAL> is 3,3V but <SIGNAL>SYS_DETECT_L</SIGNAL> is 0V no matter if battery is connected ot not. I’ve replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q6955</TRANSISTOR>. I have also tried new battery, but with no results. I'm wondering, maybe UB260 got damaged? I've resoldered it, all traces were OK, but who knows...Or maybe <TRANSISTOR>Q7065</TRANSISTOR>?"

            "message": "Update for this board...\n\nSo I was working on another board - <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-02020</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with very similar issue. After replacing one of the USB-C controllers board was not switching to 20V an not charging battery. Trying different controllers I found out, that [B]controller had to be pulled from M1 board[/B], in my case donor also was <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-02020</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>. After that, board switched to 20V and was charging battery correctly.[B] I think they could be programmed for working on specific board[/B], as their output layout on difrent schematics are different (i.e. controllers on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01949</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> have diffrent output than <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>). So I decied to go back to <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01949</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board and check my theory,\n\nI got fully working donor <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01949</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> which I took one one controller from (<SIGNAL>U3100_R</SIGNAL>). Destination board still didn't switch to 20V. So I have replacend another one (<SIGNAL>U3100_W</SIGNAL>) - also nothing. But when I replaced UB260 it magically started switching to 20V. But funny part is, that this board doesn't charge or work off original battery which computer came with (though is detected in the system). It's charging and working from new battery. I have tested the original battery with another, fully functional board - it's charging the battery correctly. So I thought another USB-C controllers which I haven't replaced yet may cause this malfunction. I have replaced them  as well including <CHIP>U3060</CHIP> and another <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>. Sadly there are no changes - original battery won't charge and as soon as I disconnect charger computer shuts down. Another battery is charging fine. But again - original battery is being charged by another, untouched board. Could somebody explain this to me? I have tried DFU restore and another battery flex cable but it hasn't changed anything. The rest of the board looks really good, no damages or corrosion."
