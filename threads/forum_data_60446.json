Worked until today.\n\nWhen you open the laptop for 2 inch, it shows backlight. But as soon as you open the screen completely the whole backlight fates out and stop working.\n\nWhen i measure at <CAPACITOR>C8473</CAPACITOR> the voltage goes up to 55v with the backlight not working and the laptop all open. When I close the laptop again and open only for 2 inches, it starts working again and at <CAPACITOR>C8473</CAPACITOR> the voltage is back at 44v. \n\nCould it be a LCD problem or is there anything else going on?\n\nRegards,\n<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0</SIGNAL>"
