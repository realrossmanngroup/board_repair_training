No liquid damage or any other visible damage, only screen replaced 1 year ago. Worked until today.\n\nWhen you open the laptop for 2 inch, it shows backlight. But as soon as you open the screen completely the whole backlight fates out and stop working.\n\nWhen i measure at C8473 the voltage goes up to 55v with the backlight not working and the laptop all open. When I close the laptop again and open only for 2 inches, it starts working again and at c8473 the voltage is back at 44v. \n\nCould it be a LCD problem or is there anything else going on?\n\nRegards,\nPPVOUT_s0"}
