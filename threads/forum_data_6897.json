        "C9560": "What is C9560? Tantalum capacitor on 820-2850 logic board that often dies and causes intermittent power to framebuffer PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS and PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS_R rail, causing GPU kernel panics. Replace with non-tantalum if machine is having random black screen or kernel panics.",
        "U9000": "What is U9000? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "R5071": "What is R5071? a RESISTOR.",
        "PPVCORE_GPU": "What is PPVCORE_GPU? This is the main power rail for the GPU. This is required for the GPU to turn on so you can get image on the display. .",
        "PP3V3_S0GPU": "What is PP3V3_S0GPU? a SIGNAL.",

        "PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS": "What is PP1V8R1V55_S0GPU_ISNS? Power rail on 820-2850 logic board for the GPU framebuffer, that is often underpowered and intermittent because of a dying C9560 capacitor that must be replaced on this model to avoid black screen & kernel panics..",

        "BKL_PWM": "What is BKL_PWM? BKL_PWM sets the brightness of the screen. The system will send a PWM signal to BKL_PWM pin to set brightness. If this is low, backlight voltage will boost higher than PPBUS_G3H input, but not enough to make the screen light properly..",
