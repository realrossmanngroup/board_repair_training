Hold down the Power button for several seconds or press the restart button\". I have already rebalanced the <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> and cleaned the ME Bios region, but it still has this defect.\n     The P2 headphone doesn't work and I don't have a piece to test, can you test it on the board to identify where is the defect ?"
