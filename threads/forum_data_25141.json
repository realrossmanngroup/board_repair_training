        "PP5V_S3": "What is PP5V_S3? PP5V_S3 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S3 suspend to RAM state..",
        "U7201": "What is U7201? U7201 is responsible for the 3.3v and 5v power rails on many devices..",
        "PM_SLP_S4_L": "What is PM_SLP_S4_L? PM_SLP_S4_L is a signal that puts the system into an S4 suspend to disk sleep state when it is low(_L means signal is asserted when voltage is low).",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP5V_S0": "What is PP5V_S0? PP5V_S0 is a 5v power rail present when the system is in an S0 working state..",
        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PP3V3_S4": "What is PP3V3_S4? The \"PP3V3_S4\" power rail in a MacBook is used to supply 3.3 volts to certain components when the system is in the S4 power state, also known as \"suspend to disk\" or \"hibernate.\" This rail is active when the MacBook is not fully off but not in an awake state, allowing for faster startup times compared to a full boot sequence. The S4 power state means Suspend to Disk: This is a low-power state where the system context is saved to disk, allowing the system to be powered down almost entirely. Upon waking, the system can restore its state from the disk, effectively resuming where it left off..",
        "P3V3S5_EN": "What is P3V3S5_EN? P3V3S5_EN is a signal that enables the power chip responsible for creating PP3V3_S5 when it is high. Signals with _EN mean that whatever is mentioned before the _EN will be enabled or turned on when the signal is high. .",

This signal will be present if ALL_SYS_PWRGD, CPU_VR_PGOOD, PP3V3_S0, and PP3V42_G3H are present. When this signal is not present or intermittent, usually pin 8 on U1950 for PP3V42_G3H is corroded..",
