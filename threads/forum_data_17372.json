        "A1534": "What is A1534? A1534 is a model number for a 12 inch size Macbook  from years 2015, 2016 with EMC 2746, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00045, 820-00244..",
        "820-00045": "What is 820-00045? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP5V1_S4SW": "What is PP5V1_S4SW? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H? This is the input from the USB-C charger or the battery that is the input voltage for the chip responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H. It can be missing when capacitors on this line are shorted to ground, or when the diode in front of it leading to the chip that creates PP3V3_G3H is blown. .",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",

            "message": "I have 12 inch MacBook A1543 Is not powering on. I started measuring the power rails and I've noticed that I'm missing <SIGNAL>PP5V1_S4SW</SIGNAL>. Also <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> is heating up as hell, and the other strange thing is on pin 56 of <CHIP>U7100</CHIP> the <SIGNAL>PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H</SIGNAL> Is around 20V and according to the schematics should be 8.6V. This is my first time working on MacBook 12 inch so I have no idea if this computer can power up without battery or not, also there is not fan to indicate on state and no chime. Makes is really difficult to troubleshoot. Any ideas?"
