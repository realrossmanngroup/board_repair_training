        "message":"Hi,\n\nI'm working on a MBP 820-01598 with pulsing rails. All rails up to PMU_ONOFF_L seem to pulse. PMU_ON_OFF_L itself is stable at 3.3V. PPBUS_G3H is cycling from 12.6V to 12.3V. PP3V3_S5 and following rails are steady 0V.\nResistances on big coils seem to be good.\nNo signs of lliquid on the board. It had some burnt components on PP5V_G3S_ALSCAM that i replaced. Already checked rails for short to grounds but didn't found anything obvious.\nAny ideas what's going on here?\n\nThanks"
