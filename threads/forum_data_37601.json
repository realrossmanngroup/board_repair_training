Poped in a test 2015 display to run ASD. Received a few sensor errors but assumed this was due the battery and display. \nInstalled a good battery and new ‘13/‘14 display - no life on display. Tried quick fixes without success. \nPopped the test ‘15 display in and it works. Will work with two of my ‘15 displays and one of my test ‘13/‘14s, but not two other known good ones. (With 2015 display I’m unable to control brightness, not sure if related or typical as it’s not the right year). \nNow when I try ASD I get “stilling looping due to system running on low memory”. Won’t run any tests. In an OS the RAM appears, and no ram beeps. \nBoard is clean, no noticeable damage. L8300 has 5v with displays connected."

Can’t seem to find a reliable flash drive that will handle the partitions.\n\nStill had weird display issues. At one point the 2015 display allowed me to adjust brightness, like when a 13/14 display is on a ‘15 - not very smooth. The 2014 worked intermittently and eventually stopped.\nFinally after multiple cleanings and inspections I knocked <SIGNAL>DP_INT_ML_N</SIGNAL>-3- <RESISTOR>R8318</RESISTOR> loose. Pin 1 was gone.\nTested with this off and the 2015 worked. Not 14/13. This isn’t apparently necessary for a ‘15 to function.\nReplaced <RESISTOR>R8318</RESISTOR>, ran a jumper and all is good again.\n\nMight be worth looking into tweaks around <RESISTOR>R8318</RESISTOR> as a possible solution to no brightness adjustment with a ‘15 display.\n\nThanks. This one is solved."
