So I proceeded to open it and take a quick look inside and all was looking fine .So I pulled out the board and connect my amp meter and placed the board under my thermal imager and found that <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> was getting super hot , so I ordered <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> on eBay since i did not have any donor boards here to harvest it from , I received the chip on Friday and I installed it Yesterday and the behavior did not change . Since after I changed <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> with the new chip that I ordered <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> and <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> The T2 along with <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> they get hot but still no 20V on my USB amp meter and no boot , I have checked all  the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> Chips  and I have even changed the whole 4 of them which  I did not even have to but did it just in case , now I m wondering if my <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> new chip can be bad as the seller would allow only one chip per order so i was able to get only one chip of <CHIP>U6903</CHIP> . <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is Present.\n\nPlease Help me out."

I have fixed a good bit of those with that same issue and never had to face that kinda issue before ."
