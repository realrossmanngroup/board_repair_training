        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC": "What is PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC? PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC Is a reference voltage for the SMCâ€™s voltage sensors & other sensors..",
        "PP15V_TBT": "What is PP15V_TBT? a SIGNAL.",
        "PBUS_G3H": "What is PBUS_G3H? This is a typo of PPBUS_G3H When you see PBUS_G3H, assume they meant to type PPBUS_G3H.",
        "C5020": "What is C5020? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C3215": "What is C3215? a CAPACITOR.",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
