        "message":"Small liquid damage on J5250 and R6323.\n\nThere is no backlight (there is data on LCD).\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT = 0V (1.1V in diode mode)\nPP5VR3V3_SW_LCD = 5V\n\nConnected known good display assembly and same issue.\nExt display works and internal display is detected in macOS.\n\nReplaced J5250, C5250, R5250 and same issue.\n\nPower button is not working, connected new keyboard and still same issue so I think there is some issue with lid sensor?\nIt think lid is closed so power button is not working and thats why there is no backlight.\n\nSMC_LID = 5V\n\nWith LCD attached and machine powered i do get\n(pin 5) PP3V3_S0_EDP_SW = 3.3v\n(pin 8 ) LCD_BKLT_PWM_R = 2.09v\n(pin 9) LCD_HPD_CONN = 3.3v\n(pins 28-30) PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD = 5v.\n\nBKL_EN_R = 3.3V\n\n\nWhen board run on charger I can't shut down with power button but can't turn on so I am sure it will be something with lid sensor etc.\n\nAny hints\/ideas?"
