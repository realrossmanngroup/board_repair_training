        "820-00426": "What is 820-00426? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "SMC_LID": "What is SMC_LID? SMC_LID tells the machine the system is open when it is 3.3v to 3.4v, and closed when it is low such as 0v-0.6v. When this signal is low, the machine may go to sleep or have no backlight. .",
        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD": "What is PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCD_HPD_CONN": "What is LCD_HPD_CONN? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCD_BKLT_PWM_R": "What is LCD_BKLT_PWM_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S0_EDP_SW": "What is PP3V3_S0_EDP_SW? a SIGNAL.",
        "BKL_EN_R": "What is BKL_EN_R? a SIGNAL.",
        "R5250": "What is R5250? a RESISTOR.",
        "R6323": "What is R6323? a RESISTOR.",
        "C5250": "What is C5250? a CAPACITOR.",
        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "U7701": "What is U7701? a CHIP.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "Q7701": "What is Q7701? a TRANSISTOR."
