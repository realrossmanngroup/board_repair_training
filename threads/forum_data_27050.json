So this laptop started to work after the GPU reflow, but failed in 1 month, was reflowed again, now works, but in OSX it starts to slow down after 10 mins, interesting that its not slow for a while, than even the mosue is very slow. I tried with a new SSD and new hdd cable and its the same thing, altough there is no typical GPU issue, like lines on screen, or discoloration, only this slow down. \nNow i installed Windows 10, and with the newest bootcamp driver it wont install, cause officaly the 2011 model doesnt support windows 10, but with a bit older bootcamp drivers it is working now, and more interestingly it wont slow down, is that becasue windows is using the I7 integrated grapshics and it would change to the dedicated one while in 3d application? \nCan someone shed a light on this to me? I know replacing the GPU would be the best but until the sourcing is sorted i need a soultion."}

It will be months before there is any chance of new GPUs becoming available. It is a big mine field of fake crap out there and not worth dealing with if you are buying 20 chips. I have about 100 chips left and would only sell them for at least $100 each, because if they are gone, they are gone at this point."}

If u can sell us few chips please PM me with the details of shipping and final prices."}
