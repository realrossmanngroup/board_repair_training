            "message": "Hi\nGot an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with 'no camera connected' here. Never really dug into no camera issues that far.\n\nIt has 5V on the connector. I decided to check the filters on the backside, all resistance was fine, i checked them for any mall voltage/signal and it was present. But as i was checking this i saw smoke from the other side of the board. Now we have no signals/activity of any kind on the <SIGNAL>MIPI_DATA</SIGNAL> lines. \n\nI couldn't locate the burnt area, It looks like it came from the connector itself however the connector has no visable damage, ive inspected both the inside pins and external condition of the connector and there is nothing visibly damaged. \n\nany help would be appreciated.\nThanks"
