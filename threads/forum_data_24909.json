        "PM_SLP_S3_L": "What is PM_SLP_S3_L? PM_SLP_S3_L puts the machine to sleep in an S3 state when it is asserted, the _L means it is asserted when it is low voltage. When this signal is 3.3v the machine will be asked to turn on S0 power rails and begin the bootup process.",

        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",
        "P3V3S3_EN": "What is P3V3S3_EN? P3V3S3_EN is a signal that turns on the PP3V3_S3 power rail when it is high. Signals with _EN on the end enable whatever came before the _EN if the signal is high. .",

I have not cleaned the board yet been holding out until looked into everything possible first.  i guess now would be a good time to clean it?"
