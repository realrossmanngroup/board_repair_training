Swapped the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>, tested diode and was normal. Powered it up and nothing. Checked it again and it seemed like it was blown again same spot but then I realized that if I waited a while after unplugging the charger the resistance would be back up to normal. Something is lowering resistance on that rail after connecting to charger. It's been a minute but I feel like <SIGNAL>U3100_T</SIGNAL> charging port was only one not drawing any amperage but all other ports were just over 5V drawing some amps.\n\nSo I think something related to that port... could something with <SIGNAL>U2800_T</SIGNAL> cause that? Does that chip have firmware or can I pull from different model board like 01958 2020 macbook air board? I don't have 01949 donor."

All seemed good and it boots, but after you turn it off, it wouldn't boot up again without letting it sit a long time (usually have to wait until the next day). It seems to be on as when I check it there is data activity. Internal screen stays off (no image/backlight) but external screen sticks to Apple logo. I successfuylly tried revive, no change. I let it sit so I could check it with hardware test and that shows no issues. I was able to restore it but issue persists. I've been unable so far to get it through recovery/reload. I'm a bit baffled as to what's happening. It seems like it just stalls out and display never comes on."
