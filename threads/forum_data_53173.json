Not even for a split second.  I know what part of the boot process it should show and it never does.   On my reference board it does.  My understanding is this should turn on and if the CPU does not get a response from the LCD or current draw is too high it will shut it down. The current draw circuitry is \"No Stuff\".\nThen I checked. (<SIGNAL>EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>) input into <CHIP>U8510</CHIP> and it never shows up. The power rails to these chips are present and normal.\n\nThe only thing in front of this is <CHIP>U0500</CHIP> \"the CPU\" I don't suspect this part. I am lacking the understanding of this process to troubleshoot further.\n\nWatching the board it does boot. Current draw pattern shows a booting board. Exact same pattern as my reference board. It even chimes like it is happy."

I could not get it to work so I put my test board in the MacBook and booted it up and also got nothing on my TV.  I did get to the desktop.  I don't have the user name or password for this machine as it came from a school.  We usually use a USB test drive but that broke yesterday.   It looks like I have to boot into the O/S before I can enable the HDMI port so not sure how to test this on a board that does not display a image.\n\nI have not tried a USB mouse.  Well I don't have one that blinks lights when you move it so not sure how to test that either."
