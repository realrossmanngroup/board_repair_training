Came in for liquid damage and a new screen, repaired the liquid damage and the board is working great except for the webcam. In system report it doesn't show up at all, tested with a known good display assembly. ALS does work however. I checked all the components between J8500 and U3900, and everything is in spec according to OpenBoardData values in FlexBV. Also checked all the surrounding components around U3900, same thing. What else should I be checking next?"}
