            "message": "Hey all, having issues with a stubborn 00840 board. Came in for liquid damage and a new screen, repaired the liquid damage and the board is working great except for the webcam. In system report it doesn't show up at all, tested with a known good display assembly. ALS does work however. I checked all the components between J8500 and <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>, and everything is in spec according to OpenBoardData values in FlexBV. Also checked all the surrounding components around <CHIP>U3900</CHIP>, same thing. What else should I be checking next?"
