            "message": "Hey, \n\nthis board before the problem mentioned in topic, works well but showing problem's like tipical GMUX on mac15 - 2009 boards. First i put the board in other mac pro 15 who knew it was good.. don't solve the problem.. next replace a connector for new one and don't solve again the problem.. \n\naftwards i reball the GMUX but when i tried to put it on the board i missed! stayed a line up. i Turn on the board and I did not hear the tipical sound. I noticed that I was not well soldered.\n\nNow i try with original and 1 off donor board(Ebay) , the machine start i hear the sound but no picture.. \n\nin Your's opinion GMUX Dead? PCH? \n\ni put a pen drive and blink like a normal start! \n\nThank you"
