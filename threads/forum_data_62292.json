The original fault was that it wasn't booting, which I suspect is a problem with the T2 but they decided to replace the power board and hence damaged the board.\n\nCan any identify what this component is and would it be detrimental to it starting.\n\niFixit mentioned AQUANTIA AQtion [URL='https:\/\/www.aquantia.com\/products\/client-connectivity\/aqtion-aqc107\/'][U]AQC107-B1-C[\/U][\/URL] PCIe to multi-gigabit ethernet controller so i'm thinking it's a filter and wouldn't stop the iMac from starting."
