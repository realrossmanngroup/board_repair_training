        "message":"So I have a 820-2879 were PPBUS_G3H will sit at 12.6V for a few seconds then slowly drop to 5V sit there for a few seconds then back to 12.6 and repeats. I think i have narrowed it down to CHGR_AGATE it will be at 16V then drop down to 6V for a bit then back to 16 causing Q7085 to not output the correct voltage. This happened with or without F7040 on the board. Does anyone have any idea why this is happening and how to fix it."
