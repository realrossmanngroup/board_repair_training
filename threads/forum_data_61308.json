        "820-3662": "What is 820-3662? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP3V42_G3H": "What is PP3V42_G3H? PP3V42_G3H is a power rail present when the machine is in a G3H global system hardware off state and is the first rail that should be generated in Macbooks that use it. .",
        "D7005": "What is D7005? a DIODE.",
        "U7090": "What is U7090? This chip is often responsible for creating PP3V42_G3H.",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "R5127": "What is R5127? a RESISTOR."

            "message": "Thank you to anyone taking the time to read this!\n\nWas a liquid damage six months ago, had a bath, a change of battery and was working fine. Since then, customer may have mentioned the battery started to perform poorly but in any case quickly and now does not run on battery alone.\n\nIt charges, coconut battery says health is good, and this a new battery again (as I took the problem at face value and just purchased a new battery - doing the test on the battery that was installed after the liquid cleaning gives all the same results) that is all to say I'm confident the battery is good.\n\nI found a couple of Rossmann videos both ended up on the G3H supply and the diode <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> (on this board) that connects the charger and battery into <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>. However both the resistors going into <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> and <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> seem good - I get the right resistance on <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR> (and <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR>) with the battery connected and no MagSafe I get 12.05V on pin 2 of <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> and 11.81V on pin 3. <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> has 3.42V on pin 4 \n\nI realise there is a little drop on <DIODE>D7005</DIODE> but could that be the issue? I thought not as 11.81V seems in range and 3.42V out of <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> look correct to my untrained eye.\n\nI'm not yet clear to attempt these repairs, really wanted to take some measurements to have a better idea of what was wrong. I'm sure the customer will be happy with us making such repairs but I'm not Louis level component repair experienced (obviously) and as the Mac otherwise works fine I'd really like to be confident I'm not going to make it worse before recommending a course of action to the customer!\n\nAny suggestions would be very much appreciated!"
