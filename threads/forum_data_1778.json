When i checked voltage cant see  <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL>.\nWhen i checked <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> its too hot and replaced it 2 times but nothing changed its also hot. After that i was removed L7260,<TRANSISTOR>Q7260</TRANSISTOR>,<TRANSISTOR>Q6201</TRANSISTOR>,<TRANSISTOR>Q7220</TRANSISTOR>,L7220, and all resistors and capacitors around <CHIP>U7200</CHIP> but same status:(  <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S5_5VS3</SIGNAL> is 12.8 not problem. Do you have any suggestion ?\n\nnote: I checked <SIGNAL>PP5V_S3_REG</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_REG</SIGNAL> not short a ground."
