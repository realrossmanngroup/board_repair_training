This was fixed by soldering around <CHIP>U8900</CHIP> (i think thats the chip). However, once the laptop gets to the login screen the fans start to ramp up to full speed.\n\nI have tried a known good OSX and its still the same.\nThis unit passes ASD EFI & OS, as well as the VST & MRI.\n\nThe odd thing is, when this unit is in diagnostics mode, the fans are perfect.\n\nI'm seriously stuck on this !!!"

Which means its something dead obvious, which i'm failing to see.\n\nI'm thinking this is a bad battery  When its plugged in, PPBUS drops to 10.8 - 11.5V. Unplugged we are back to 12.6V. I dont keep batteries for retinas in stock, so have ordered a top case in for testing. \n\nLets see.........."

Also with a clean OSX it does the same.\nWhen battery fully charged, PPBUS only gets to 11.5V. Once unplugged its back to 12.6V.\n\nWaiting for ebay battery to test with.....other than that i've no idea."
