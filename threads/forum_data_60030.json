This can be fixed by adding a 100pF capacitor between TCK and ground(GND).\nIf the above fix still isn't working for you, you can temporarily remove L2406 before flashing. Make sure to solder it back on when you are done flashing.\"\n\nI still couldnt flash the gmux yet, it wasnt properly detected.\n\nNo, I did not remove <RESISTOR>R8904</RESISTOR>/11"
