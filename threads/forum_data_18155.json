        "PP3V3_SUS": "What is PP3V3_SUS? The \"PP3V3_SUS\" rail on a MacBook logic board is a power rail that provides a 3.3-volt supply to the suspend-to-RAM (S3 state) components. .",
        "PM_SLP_S5_L": "What is PM_SLP_S5_L? PM_SLP_S5_L is a signal that, when 3.3v, turns on power rails that will wake the system from an S5 state. This signal is a part of the power management system of the MacBook.  The \\\"PM\\\" prefix typically stands for \\\"Power Management,\\\" and the \\\"SLP\\\" is for \\\"Sleep.\\\" The \\\"S5\\\" denotes the specific sleep state, which is Suspend to Disk, and the \\\"_L\\\" suffix indicates that this is an active low signal..",

Was sent back to china again, came back working. Sat in cupboard for a couple weeks and now it doesn't boot.\n\nSpent some time with it. Seems <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S5_L</SIGNAL> is missing, and the rails that rely on that are missing. All s5 rails present. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> present. <SIGNAL>PM_DSW_PWRGD</SIGNAL> present.\n\nHas a look over to see if I can tell what china rework messed with and looks like L7310 and l7320 were pulled off at some point.\n\nIm pretty new to rework, so if someone could point me in the right direction that would be appreciated."
