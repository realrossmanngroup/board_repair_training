Replaced the cap, and had ASD running and it failed the Video Controller Internal (test #40) - Gmux Switch to IG. Should I disregard this, or should I go ahead and heat the Mux up a bit? Computer seems to work fine in OS; I don't see any option to switch graphics in System Preferences (but I'm unfamiliar with this board--should there be an option in Energy Saver to do so? If so, is the fact that it's missing a sign that there's a Mux issue?). \n\nThanks!"}

I bet it is not recognizing the 9600 card. This is really too old to bother with and the customer has never noticed the problem, I'd leave it as-is."}
