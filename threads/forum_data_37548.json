Yeah! Took a screen to check for the flashing folder... wouldn't start anymore.\n\nSometimes, the board will reach .1A and stay there, like it is stuck in an S3\/S0 states but then next restart .02A, S5 rails only.\nHowever one important thing to notice is that PPBUS_G3H is sometimes dropping to 8V or slightly lower.\nI believe I could have a partial short somewhere but I did measure every rail in diode mode and the values are very similar.\n\nI wanna win that board but it smells the rabbit hole to me as I've spent many hours already.\n\nAny idea what could cause PPBUS_G3H to drop like that?"}
