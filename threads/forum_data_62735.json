        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",
        "PPDCIN_G3H": "What is PPDCIN_G3H? PPDCIN_G3H Is a power rail that comes directly from the laptop charger..",
        "D7012": "What is D7012? Diode between ground and gate of Q7010 on 2013-2015 year model macbook airs, necessary for Q7010 to allow PPDCIN_G3H to flow through to PP3V42_G3H power supply input. When this diode dies or corrodes, PP3V42_G3H input will not have any voltage, and chargers will not turn on. This can often be the problem if a system only works with a knockoff charger/bench power supply. .",
        "Q7180": "What is Q7180? Inrush limiter transistor that must be told by the ISL6259 that it is safe to allow charger voltage to pass through to the computer. This needs CHGR_AGATE and CHGR_SGATE to be pulled down in order for it to close and allow voltage through to the system, current sensing failures as well as ISL6259 failures can cause this to happen. .",

Full functionality seems to be restored. \nAlthough when connected to my bench power supply with Magsafe2 cable, MacBook works and charges as expected. With the original brand new genuine 85W MagSafe, it won't turn on, and the light on the charger will blink green (seems like power cycles). The same phenomenon with 2 spare genuine chargers. \n\nTried 3 spare DCIN Boards and flex cables.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> - 16.5V with Bench PSU - 3.3V with Genuine Chargers\n\nThe bizarre part is that with any of these chargers when connected to spare <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1466</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> turns it on, but loses the backlight in 10 sec and keeps running. \nWhile it seems to be ok with the bench PSU."
