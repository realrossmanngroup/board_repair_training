Had this with liquid damage, extensive but not much corrosion. Cleaned the liquid and ran it through UC. Full functionality seems to be restored. \nAlthough when connected to my bench power supply with Magsafe2 cable, MacBook works and charges as expected. With the original brand new genuine 85W MagSafe, it won't turn on, and the light on the charger will blink green (seems like power cycles). The same phenomenon with 2 spare genuine chargers. \n\nTried 3 spare DCIN Boards and flex cables.\n\nPPDCIN_G3H - 16.5V with Bench PSU - 3.3V with Genuine Chargers\n\nThe bizarre part is that with any of these chargers when connected to spare A1466 turns it on, but loses the backlight in 10 sec and keeps running. \nWhile it seems to be ok with the bench PSU."}
