No corrosion anywhere and only minor dust.\n\nGreen\/amber light but no life. No response to SMC bypass. Checking the rails everything looks good down to pp5v_s5 which is bouncing around from 3v-4.4v. PPVIN_S5_P5V is solid at 12.58v. Almost everything else on U7501 is bouncing around.\n\nSMC_PM_G2_EN - bouncing quickly from .8v-3v.. reball SMC?"}
