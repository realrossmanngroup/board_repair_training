Customer continued working with it till it gave no picture anymore.\n<SIGNAL>EDP_INT_AUX_N</SIGNAL> 20 ohms to ground with everything disconnected. External display works, so definitely a defective CPU.\n\nI have also a donor board from exactly the same macbook, also (I hope) a 2,9GHz i5 from 2016. This had a burnt <CAPACITOR>C7901</CAPACITOR> (<SIGNAL>PPBUS_HS_CPU</SIGNAL>), which literally burnt a hole in the board. Normally this CPU should be fine.\nBut it's a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00239</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-[I]09[/I] board.\n\nOn the CPU of the donor board, I can read two numbers: J619B764SR2JK (horizontally) and 00014 (vertically)\nThe target board's CPU is listed with J625C284SR2JK (horizontally) and 05621 (vertically)\nI don't have experience with this Intel numbers. Are that serial numbers, date codes or partnumbers :unsure:\n\nShould it be possible to place the CPU of the donor board to the target board?"
