(have waited 10 mins no patience to wait longer). tried booting from a bootable hdd to rule out software and it was acting the same.\n\nhardware wise what could cause this type of issue?  Ran apple diagnostic and no issues there. it passed hardware stresstest and memtest as well."

Problem is i tried several SSD(apple ssd), known good working and tested with another macbook runs fine! but some of them were not detected at all, getting Folder logo on boot, but found 1 that boots and shut down properly now.\n\nSSD Compatibility issue? \ni remember awhile back also while doing SSD Upgrade on this model, it didn't accept the m.2 adapter version and only boots with apple ssd. never seen this on the macbook pro though. weird"
