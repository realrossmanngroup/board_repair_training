I have an 820-3115 board works fully on adapter, sees and charges battery.  With battery plugged in and fully charged, disconnecting AC kills machine.  When starting only on battery, get a 3 second fan spin.  Water damage by battery connector, replaced C6950 and C6950.  Tried other batteries.\n\nThought it may be a current sensing issue but u7000 pins 27 and 28 measure 20.4 ohms.\n\nAny thoughts on what to check next?\n\nthx,\nPaul"}

Was there liquid damage around SMC\/U5010? If that seems ok then run ASD too."}
