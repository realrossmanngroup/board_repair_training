Reposting here:\n\nGot an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> here on the bench which is causing some confusion. Green Light is there which turns orange as normal, ppbus present 8.6V.\n\nVisual inspection revealed tiny amount of corrosion around <CHIP>U1930</CHIP> - pulled this off replaced from a donor board and still no power. Pulled it off again and tried the board without <CHIP>U1930</CHIP> and getting fan spin and no display (expected).\n\nSo i'm in a position now where if <CHIP>U1930</CHIP> is on the board I get no fan spin, no power up. If <CHIP>U1930</CHIP> is off then the board attempts to power up but doesn't give display.\n\nPossible dead <CHIP>U1930</CHIP> maybe? Or am I missing something completely obvious here! There is no corrosion anywhere else on the board that I can see!"

Only thing I can think of is there's a CPU issue - it's reading 10ohms to ground on the Phase 1 power rail. Going to pop this one on the unrepairable pile and sell the customer one of my previously repaired boards instead. I do notice the CPU's are more fragile on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00165</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> than they are on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> is that normal or am I just unlucky?"
