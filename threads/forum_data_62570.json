Reposting here:\n\nGot an 820-00165 here on the bench which is causing some confusion. Green Light is there which turns orange as normal, ppbus present 8.6V.\n\nVisual inspection revealed tiny amount of corrosion around u1930 - pulled this off replaced from a donor board and still no power. Pulled it off again and tried the board without U1930 and getting fan spin and no display (expected).\n\nSo i'm in a position now where if U1930 is on the board I get no fan spin, no power up. If U1930 is off then the board attempts to power up but doesn't give display.\n\nPossible dead U1930 maybe? Or am I missing something completely obvious here! There is no corrosion anywhere else on the board that I can see!"}

With it out i'm getting ALL_SYS_PWRGD, PM_SLP_S3_L and all S0 voltages. With it there get a small pulse on ALL_SYS_PWRGD and then the board reverts and stays in S5 state.\n\nBoard does absolutely nothing in SMC Bypass Mode"}

Only thing I can think of is there's a CPU issue - it's reading 10ohms to ground on the Phase 1 power rail. Going to pop this one on the unrepairable pile and sell the customer one of my previously repaired boards instead. I do notice the CPU's are more fragile on 820-00165 than they are on 820-3437 is that normal or am I just unlucky?"}
