The unit powers on when the charger is connected with the battery plugged in, light goes amber, fan spins and stops 3 times then the system powers up and works as expected. I cannot turn it off or on using the power button. I disconnected the IPD Flex and shorted SMC_ONOFF_L to ground but it still doesn't work. I am lost here as the circuit doesn't have alot of components but I still can't find the fault. Any help would be appreciated."}

Now no power at all.  Orange light on. SMC_Reset_L present at 3.4V but doesn't seem to go low. Checked R5100 and R5127 and they are both okay."}

We need more history!\n\n2) How does R5170 work? What do you measure here\/\n\n3) Does PM_PWRBTN_L move down towards 0v when you press the power button? \n\n4) What power rails aren't\/are present?"}
