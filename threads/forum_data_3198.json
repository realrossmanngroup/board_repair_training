        "SMC_ONOFF_L": "What is SMC_ONOFF_L? SMC_ONOFF_L tells the computer that the power button has been pressed when it is low, _L means signal is asserted when it is low voltage. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",

The \"L\" at the end of \"PM_PWRBTN_L\" suggests that it is an active-low signal, meaning that when the power button is pressed, the signal is pulled low to initiate the boot sequence..",

            "message": "I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3437</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> with no power button. The unit powers on when the charger is connected with the battery plugged in, light goes amber, fan spins and stops 3 times then the system powers up and works as expected. I cannot turn it off or on using the power button. I disconnected the IPD Flex and shorted <SIGNAL>SMC_ONOFF_L</SIGNAL> to ground but it still doesn't work. I am lost here as the circuit doesn't have alot of components but I still can't find the fault. Any help would be appreciated."
