        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

VIN is present, Fuse is good, Power goes no further than <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR> as normal when its not enabling. No shorts.ect\nWorks on external. Kinda at a loss as there is no sign of liquid anywhere on the machine so i dont know where to look\nAlso tried another WLED with no change."

Ive tried putting a torch through and got nothing\n\nIll check for missing caps, but there are none near the LVDS, And ill check the filters coming from the LVDS. I dont have a good board to compare diode mode readings with so its becoming a nightmare."

If all the caps and traces to/from the LCD connector look good and you verified continuity from the caps to the end of a separate LCD cable then try replacing both backlight chips."
