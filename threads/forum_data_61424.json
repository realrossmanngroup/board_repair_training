I have repaired the board so that the machine is running now. I only have problem with the backlight after closing\/opening the lid.\n\nAfter opening it looks like the display is black. After pressing a Key the picture is coming up without backlight.\nIf i put it to sleep via the menu and then wake it up again, it behaves normally.\n\nCan you tell me where to continue troubleshooting. If necessary, i can give you detailed information about the damage and the work i have done so far."}
