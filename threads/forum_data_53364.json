    "definitions": {
        "820-00244": "What is 820-00244? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "U3100": "What is U3100? a CHIP.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP3V3R3V0_AON": "What is PP3V3R3V0_AON? PP3V3R3V0_AON is the first power rail you need to get a USB-C charger to go from 5v to 20v on an A1534 Macbook with an 820-00045 board..",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "U7650": "What is U7650? a CHIP.",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC": "What is PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA": "What is PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA? PP3V3_S5_SMC_VDDA is a 3.3v power rail present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state that powers the SMC that comes from PP3V3_S5. A blown or corroded L4901 inductor behind it can kepe it from working, inductor number will differ depending on your board. .",
        "PP3V0_S5_AVREF_SMC": "What is PP3V0_S5_AVREF_SMC? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7800": "What is U7800? a CHIP.",
        "PP5V_G3H": "What is PP5V_G3H? PP5V_G3H is a 5v rail present when the machine is in a G3H mechanical off state.",
        "PP3V3_PMICLDO": "What is PP3V3_PMICLDO? a SIGNAL.",
        "PP1V25_PMICVREF": "What is PP1V25_PMICVREF? a SIGNAL.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012."
