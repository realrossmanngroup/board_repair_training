You will either need to put the original SSD in with the customers install, or get the EFI lock password from the customer.\nIf neither is an option, then pull the EEPROM \/ SPIROM and dunp the file a couple of times, make sure they both have the same MD5 and keep one as a backup. 0xFF out the small string of crap after each $SVS\u00b0 feild, flash it back to the chip and slap the chip back on. Done. Get a Mini Pro TL866 from eBay for about $40 i think"
