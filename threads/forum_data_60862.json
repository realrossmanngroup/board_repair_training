I have found one chip particulary interesting and I must admit I cannot understand what it is doing based on the data sheet.\n\nThe schematics is shown in the attached picture. The output is used to produce 1.05V (PP1V05_S0). My first impression was that this is an logical AND gate. According to the datasheet: [I] The  AUP1G09  is  a  single  AND  gate  with  an  open  drain  output  designed  for  operation  over  a  power  supply  range  of  0.8V  to  3.6V. [\/I]  But the actual Bollean formula is for NAND gate.\n\nThe complete datasheet is here:  [URL]https:\/\/pdf1.alldatasheet.com\/datasheet-pdf\/view\/473494\/DIODES\/74AUP1G09.html[\/URL]\n\nCan you please clarify this?\nThis circuit is supplied by 3.3V. So, if both inputs (A and B) are high (3.3V), what is the output of this IC chip? From schematics it is supposed to be 1.05V after resistor 10 kOhm.\n\nThank you.\n\nEDIT: This must be error in the data sheet because I found teh similar circuit produced by IT and there is different Boolean formula."}

When MOSFET is not ON (blocked state), the voltage on the drain is not Vcc but floating?.\nOpen Drain means that volatge is not equal to Vcc"}

So something else is driving it, which is the pull-up resistor R1931, pulling it to PP1V05_S0.\nSo in this case CPU_VCCST_PWRGD will be 1.05V if ALL_SYS_PWRGD and PM_SLP_S3_L are high (3.3V).\nIt is redundant since PM_SLP_S3_L needs to be high anyway to have ALL_SYS_PWRGD high, so in fact this circuit simply acts as a level shifter. Meaning that it converts the 3.3V level of ALL_SYS_PWRGD to the 1.05V level of CPU_VCCST_PWRGD.\nWhen ALL_SYS_PWRGD is low (or PM_SLP_S3_L), then the output MOSFET of the IC is turned on, pulling the output to ground, so in that case CPU_VCCST_PWRGD will be 0V."}

If the output is floating, how come that pull up resistor ensures exactly 1.05V? All voltages around IC are 3.3 V and yet this 10 K resistor with 5% tolerance will pull up voltage to 1.05V so aacurately and precisely?"}

It doesn't really matter that the voltage isn't *exactly* 1.0500\u2026V so 5% tolerance on the resistor which will translates to a possible +\/- 5% on CPU_VCCST_PWRGD doesn't matter. PP1V05_S0 itself will not be *exactly* 1.0500\u2026V to begin with.\n\nTo be quite exact there are still some very small leakage current in the 74AUP1G09 even when the output is high impedance, it is specified in the datasheet as Ioz at around 0.2mA if Vo is pulled up to 3.6V, which translate to a resistance to ground of around 18Mohms (it's most likely not linear but let's assume that it is).\n\nSo that chip and the pull-up resistor form a sort of voltage divider between PP1V05_S0 and CPU_VCCST_PWRGD.\nSo the voltage on CPU_VCCST_PWRGD is 1.05V \u00d7 18Mohms \/ (18Mohms + 10kohms) = 1.0494V. So it has a very negligible impact.\n\nOn the CPU_VCCST_PWRGD line you also have the CPU, which also has a very high input impedance. I don't know what's the exact value, but the resulting voltage drop on CPU_VCCST_PWRGD will also be very negligible."}
