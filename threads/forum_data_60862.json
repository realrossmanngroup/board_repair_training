            "message": "Hello guys,\n\nI'm studying the schematics trying to understand what different IC chips are doing. I have found one chip particulary interesting and I must admit I cannot understand what it is doing based on the data sheet.\n\nThe schematics is shown in the attached picture. The output is used to produce 1.05V (<SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL>). My first impression was that this is an logical AND gate. According to the datasheet: [I] The  AUP1G09  is  a  single  AND  gate  with  an  open  drain  output  designed  for  operation  over  a  power  supply  range  of  0.8V  to  3.6V. [/I]  But the actual Bollean formula is for NAND gate.\n\nThe complete datasheet is here:  [URL]https://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/473494/DIODES/74AUP1G09.html[/URL]\n\nCan you please clarify this?\nThis circuit is supplied by 3.3V. So, if both inputs (A and B) are high (3.3V), what is the output of this IC chip? From schematics it is supposed to be 1.05V after resistor 10 kOhm.\n\nThank you.\n\nEDIT: This must be error in the data sheet because I found teh similar circuit produced by IT and there is different Boolean formula."

            "message": "Yes, with open-drain output, when output MOSFET of the IC is off, the output is high impedance, ie. not driven, or floating. So something else is driving it, which is the pull-up resistor <RESISTOR>R1931</RESISTOR>, pulling it to <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL>.\nSo in this case <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL> will be 1.05V if <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> are high (3.3V).\nIt is redundant since <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL> needs to be high anyway to have <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> high, so in fact this circuit simply acts as a level shifter. Meaning that it converts the 3.3V level of <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> to the 1.05V level of <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL>.\nWhen <SIGNAL>ALL_SYS_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is low (or <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_S3_L</SIGNAL>), then the output MOSFET of the IC is turned on, pulling the output to ground, so in that case <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL> will be 0V."

All voltages around IC are 3.3 V and yet this 10 K resistor with 5% tolerance will pull up voltage to 1.05V so aacurately and precisely?"

            "message": "There's nothing else on the line to pull it down, so yes it'll be around 1.05V. It doesn't really matter that the voltage isn't *exactly* 1.0500…V so 5% tolerance on the resistor which will translates to a possible +/- 5% on <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL> doesn't matter. <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> itself will not be *exactly* 1.0500…V to begin with.\n\nTo be quite exact there are still some very small leakage current in the 74AUP1G09 even when the output is high impedance, it is specified in the datasheet as Ioz at around 0.2mA if Vo is pulled up to 3.6V, which translate to a resistance to ground of around 18Mohms (it's most likely not linear but let's assume that it is).\n\nSo that chip and the pull-up resistor form a sort of voltage divider between <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S0</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL>.\nSo the voltage on <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL> is 1.05V × 18Mohms / (18Mohms + 10kohms) = 1.0494V. So it has a very negligible impact.\n\nOn the <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL> line you also have the CPU, which also has a very high input impedance. I don't know what's the exact value, but the resulting voltage drop on <SIGNAL>CPU_VCCST_PWRGD</SIGNAL> will also be very negligible."
