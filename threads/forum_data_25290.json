        "message":"One for all the BGA nuts here.\nGot an 820-2914 that i replaced the GPU on, First boot was perfect. After the first boot i shut it down to boot to a USB drive for some stress testing.\nSince then its just white screened at boot, (just sticks on white, doesn't shut down)\nThis is the second time ive had a 2914 with the same behaviour. \nIt was a straight 005 replacement, I have reflown the VRAM and GPU again and checked for missing components. \n\nAlso this is strange because it was booting prior however it was shutting down during stress testing. It is a apple refurb board."
