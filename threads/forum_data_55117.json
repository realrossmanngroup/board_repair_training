        "message":"I receive a board A1523 2015, at first it only charges, no usb-c devices where recognized, try different adapters and usb-c to usb-c cables, and nothing. But it charges.\n\nThen I order some U4520 IC, and change U4520. Now I can have video with a USB-C to HDMI adapter, also USB 3.0 pendrives and HDD are recognized. But can't sync an iPhone or connect a printer, don't have more USB 2.0 stuff to test.\n\nSo I change U4440, no changes. I have spend last 4 hours trying to make sence of the schematics, but not sure what my starting point should be."
