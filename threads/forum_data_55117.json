But it charges.\n\nThen I order some <CHIP>U4520</CHIP> IC, and change <CHIP>U4520</CHIP>. Now I can have video with a USB-C to HDMI adapter, also USB 3.0 pendrives and HDD are recognized. But can't sync an iPhone or connect a printer, don't have more USB 2.0 stuff to test.\n\nSo I change <CHIP>U4440</CHIP>, no changes. I have spend last 4 hours trying to make sence of the schematics, but not sure what my starting point should be."
