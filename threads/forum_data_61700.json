Only the charger green light turns on.  I did all resets and still the same. I checked Louis Youtube video and the PP1V05_S5_MCP was measuring 3mV. I replaced C7771 and the rail back to normal 1.1V. I installed only the fan to check if it would run and nothing. I installed back the board and battery is disconnected. Using the power bottom, the fans still do not run.  The measurements I did so far are attached.\n\n I have some newbie questions:\n- How to power on\/off the board without the power bottom?\n- In the image attached the table shows  SMC_PM_G2_ENABLE will be 0V with out Battery. So the P3V3S5_EN also will be 0v and U7201 will be disable and PP3V3_S5 should be 0v like I measure even though is S5 rail?\n- This voltage for the original charger (16.69V) is normal?\n- Where I buy original charger and battery?\n\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.\n\nPs: the board is in excellent condition.\nPs1: Louis you're the man. Love your Youtube Channel... Big Fan for long time.\n\nThanks All\n\n\n\n\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP18V5_DCIN_CONN[\/TD]\n[TD]16.69V[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPBUS_G3H[\/TD]\n[TD]8.4V[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V42_G3H[\/TD]\n[TD]3.4V[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP1V05_S5_MCP[\/TD]\n[TD]1.1V[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_S5[\/TD]\n[TD]0V 630ohms[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_S5_REG[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S3_REG[\/TD]\n[TD]0v[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPVIN_S5_P5VP3V3[\/TD]\n[TD]8.4V[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]P3V3S5_EN[\/TD]\n[TD]???[\/TD]\n[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60153[\/ATTACH]"}

So, I thought I have anything holding the board. I left everything together and did power on by pad R5015 and the mac book power on ok. I think the membrane power ON\/OFF switch is bad.
