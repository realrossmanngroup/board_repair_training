I checked Louis Youtube video and the <SIGNAL>PP1V05_S5_MCP</SIGNAL> was measuring 3mV. I replaced <CAPACITOR>C7771</CAPACITOR> and the rail back to normal 1.1V. I installed only the fan to check if it would run and nothing. I installed back the board and battery is disconnected. Using the power bottom, the fans still do not run.  The measurements I did so far are attached.\n\n I have some newbie questions:\n- How to power on/off the board without the power bottom?\n- In the image attached the table shows  <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_ENABLE</SIGNAL> will be 0V with out Battery. So the <SIGNAL>P3V3S5_EN</SIGNAL> also will be 0v and <CHIP>U7201</CHIP> will be disable and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> should be 0v like I measure even though is S5 rail?\n- This voltage for the original charger (16.69V) is normal?\n- Where I buy original charger and battery?\n\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.\n\nPs: the board is in excellent condition.\nPs1: Louis you're the man.
