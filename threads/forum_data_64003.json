This MacBook came to me with no power due to water damage. I found corrosion in the UP701 Area, I cleaned the area and the computer started working again . After putting all components back together, the computer worked for a couple of minutes normally with image . After a couple of minutes the image was gone . I hear the chime but not image.\n\nI replaced UP701.\n\nVoltages :\nPP3V3_S2    2.16v\nPP3V3_SW_LCD_CONN  2.16V\nPPVOUT_LCDBKLT  0.01v\nPP5V_SW_LCD_CONN  5.2V\n\nDiode Mode reading:\n\nPPVOUT_LCDBKLT   1670 (not sure if this is normal)"}
