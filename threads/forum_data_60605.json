Very isolated damage.\nNothing looked corroded, just cleaning the liquid stains (probably had sugar) was enough to see that the parts were not visibly damaged.\n\nI will post the measurements, but keep in mind that I already tried replacing Y1905, U1900 and I checked with another bios to ensure that's not the issue.\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.58V\nPP3V3_S5 - 3.3V\nPP5V_S5 - 5V\nPPVRTC_G3H - 3.3V\nPP3V3_TBT_LC - 0.5V\n\nSYS_CLK_CLK25M_X1 - 0.6V-0.7V\nSYS_CLK_CLK25M_X2 - 0V\n\nRTC_RESET_L - 3.3V\nPCH_INTVRMEN - 3.2V\nPCH_INTRUDER_L - 3V\nPCH_SRTCRST_L - 3.3V\nPCH_DSWVRMEN - 3.2V\n\nPP3V3_SUS - 3.3V\nSPI_MLB_IO3_HOLD_L - 3.3V\nSPI_MLB_CLK - 3.3V\nSPI_MLB_IO0_MOSI - 3.3V\nSPI_MLBROM_CS_L - 3.3V\nSPI_MLB_IO_MISO - 3.3V\nSPI_MLB_IO2_WP_l - 3.3V\n\nPM_SLP_SUS_L - 3.3V\nPM_SLP_S5_L - 0V (Pulsing on start)\nPM_SLP_S4_L - 0V (Pulsing on start)\nPM_SLP_S0_L - 0V (Pulsing on start)\n\nPP3V3_S4 - 0.34V (Pulsing on start)\nPP3V3_S0 - 0V (Pulsing on start)\nPP5VS4_RS3 - 0V (Pulsing on start)\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 0V (Pulsing on start)\n\nI figured many rails are present for a second on charger connect while writing this post.\nIs there any way I can find what is causing it to pulse without measuring every capacitor on the board for short?\n\nResistance to ground:\n\nPP3V3_S0 - 2.2k\nPP5V_S0 - 3.6k\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 8.4 ohm\n\nThe board takes 0.02 Amps when connected to a power supply with a MagSafe cable."}

The only crap on the board was around the clock chip, u3510 only this chip and a bit went down to c7540 and C7582.
