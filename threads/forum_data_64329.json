        "A2179": "What is A2179? A2179 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2020 with EMC 3302, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-01958..",
        "ISL9240": "What is ISL9240? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2018 through 2020.",
        "U6960": "What is U6960? a CHIP.",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",
        "R7022": "What is R7022? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",

Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing as much power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging.."

            "message": "Hi all, hoping to get help narrowing down an odd issue. \n\nBoard has had liquid damage, and would not boot when it was dropped off. Never had a G3H short prior to cleaning or afterwards. Cleaned and reflowed minor liquid damage, nothing severe enough to cause a short in the first place. Reflowed <CHIP>ISL9240</CHIP>, there was very minor corrosion nearby. Absolutely zero corrosion at CD3217s.\n\nBoard booted up fine with no issue afterwards, logged into OS, all functions working as they should. Suddenly while sitting idle at desktop, it shuts off, while on battery and charger. The board was on for roughly 3 minutes before shutting down, computer was fully assembled. \n\nNow the issue is that I've got 5v on my USBC meter with intermittent (not looping) .025A, on either port. Still no shorts, G3H RTC not present, G3H stuck at .9v-1v. <RESISTOR>R7061</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7062</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7022</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7021</RESISTOR> all showing normal impedance, swapped them back and forth anyway with known good board, no change. Changed <CHIP>ISL9240</CHIP> THREE TIMES :(  Same result every time. I've swapped the ISL with a known good donor, it works fine when taken from the donor, and when it's reinstalled back to the donor. Everything I check points to the ISL being the issue, or maybe <CHIP>U6960</CHIP>, which I've replaced as well. \n\nI'm sure something silly is evading me and I missed something, I'm hoping that's the case. Thanks for any input!"
