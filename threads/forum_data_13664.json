            "message": "Hello, I have a 3435 with no orange light. Corrosion on <CAPACITOR>C7098</CAPACITOR> and <RESISTOR>R7095</RESISTOR>. After replacement still a short to ground, removed <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> and on pin 6 I get 0.329v and on 1/2/4 0.022v so there is some short on the outside. Voltage I get on pin 6 = 15.06v is that correct? How should i go about, but power on the line see where it gets hot?"
