If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical.."

            "message": "I've done a few no backlights on Airs, but I have never done an older style Pro, so I wanna make sure I get on the right track. I tried a PRAM reset to begin with, but no go. There is no sign of liquid damage anywhere on the board it looks as clean as can be (too clean actually). Took the board out tried a known good 2012 LCD and got nothing, so I started measuring. <SIGNAL>PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL> in diode mode is 0.31 but fluctuates quite a bit. Is it something obvious like a feedback via, or LED driver for sure, or something obvious with that value? I just don't want to remove things like a moron but rather start on the right track and learn something. Any ideas?"
