Powers on fine, POSTs, even passes the ASD RAM tests. AHT failed once and Memtest68 fails with hundreds of errors by the time it's done.\n\nIs there a way to match the address memtest gives to a specific RAM chip? Something else I should be looking for? With (as far as I know) nothing to go on all I can do is come here and ask for help :)"

Back in the G4/G5 days there was Phoenix OS that would have tests like that but I have not seen that leaked for Intel machines. So yeah, probably need to pull and replace all RAM :( And after that it could still be an issue inside the board or the CPU. I wouldn't mess with it.\n\nLook up the RAMCFG1-4 straps and swap the resistors to pull them all high. I believe this will disable half the RAM so maybe you get lucky."
