Pin 27,28,29,30 are tied together to connect to L9000.\n\nIs there any easy way to mount the screen so i can measure this while everything is plugged in?\n\nIt is very hard to measure pins when the screen is mounted, but if i take out the panel, the measurement wont tell anything right?\n\nBut let me state the value when the panel is disconnected first anyway:\n<SIGNAL>VIDEO_ON</SIGNAL> = 0v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q9001</TRANSISTOR> pin 3 = 11.58v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q9000</TRANSISTOR> pin 4 = 11.81v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q9000</TRANSISTOR> pin 3 = 11.66v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q9000</TRANSISTOR> pin 1,2,5,6 = low.. 0.2v to sometimes 1.5v\n\nDoes the board communicate with the panel via pin 2,3 (i2c) before powering up the panel?
