            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-4924</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> came in not booting. SSD was the cause. Changed the SSD and it boots.\n\nHowever, now the fan runs on full speed. HWSensors shows Airport Proximity Thermal Sensor at 129°C, all others just fine (around 40°C)\nI don't have ASD for that machine, MRI Tool hangs and AHT shows no errors.\n\nAlready changed Airport Card, RIO Board, RIO Flex, no luck.\n\nLD indicators are missing, but board doesn't show any signs of LD. If it was cleaned, it was cleaned properly. No corroded parts or any other hint.\n\nDoes anybody know some usual suspects for this?\n\nBR!"
