            "message": "Hello. I am usually pretty good at fixing 5v issues on touchbar machines, but this one has got me stumped. This board had very minor liquid damage in some small areas around the board. It takes steady 5v on all 4 ports and the amp draw fluctuates between 40-60ma. <CHIP>U3100</CHIP> has some minor corrosion around it so I changed it but it did not make any difference. I do not find any shorts and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> is present at 3.4v on all 4 ports. I compared diode mode reading on all the LDO lines for the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> and they all match. All 4 chips produce their 1.1v LDO rail, so it does not seem to be an issue with the <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s. Despite this, I still replaced the other 3 <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s just in case but still have the same issue. I figured it must be an SMC issue, so I replaced the SMC from a donor board of the same model, but still same thing. All 4 ports still steady 5v and 40-60ma. <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>BUF_SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> are both preset at 3.3v and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is ~10mv and is not shorted, so I don't know what else could be wrong. Is there something else I should check?"

I removed <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> again and checked diode mode values on all the pads and compared them to a good board. I noticed pad 6 and 31 were higher than normal. I replaced <TRANSISTOR>Q7030</TRANSISTOR> and <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR>, and the diode mode values now match my good board, but still only get 5v on the charger. I connected the battery again and still have 20v 0 amp draw. Checked for a pulse at <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> again and this time it does go to 3.3v and stays like that. <SIGNAL>PM_RSMRST_L</SIGNAL> also goes high and I noticed the CPU was getting warm, as if the board was turning on, and CPUVCORE voltage was preset at .6v. I put the board back in the case and connected everything and when you open the lid, nothing happens, but if I hit the power button, it actually turns on and boots. Left fan is spinning at high speed, but right fan is normal. Diagnostic mode reports there may be an issue with the fan, but nothing else. If I connect the charger, it does not charge or recognize the charger on any port. I also noticed that USB devices are not recognized at all either when connected to any of the ports. The light on the USB does not even turn on."
