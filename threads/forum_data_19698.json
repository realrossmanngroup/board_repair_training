S3 (Suspend to RAM) is a state where the system saves its context to RAM, a faster but more power-consuming method than S4. The system shuts down most components except for RAM, which remains powered to retain the system state. PM_SLP_S4_L is required for this rail to be present. ."

Best is to watch all Louis's videos as 90% is explained right there.\nShort version is: PP3V42 -> green light -> PPVRTC -> <SIGNAL>3V3_S5</SIGNAL> -> <SIGNAL>5V_S3</SIGNAL> and all other S3 and S0 rails should follow. CPU Vcore will be the last one to come on before reset is released and CPU starts executing code."
