Was fixing an audio issue around <CHIP>U6400</CHIP> but cannot say whether or not that's when it started. I can confirm once upon a time the board worked fine though. Not sure if it was damaged from being in a pile or from me fixing audio.\n\nEdit:\n<SIGNAL>FAN_RT_PWM</SIGNAL> - 4.88v\n<SIGNAL>FAN_LT_PWM</SIGNAL> - 0v\n\nReplace <TRANSISTOR>Q6000</TRANSISTOR> or is it something else?"
