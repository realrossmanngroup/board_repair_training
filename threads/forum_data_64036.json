Was fixing an audio issue around U6400 but cannot say whether or not that's when it started. I can confirm once upon a time the board worked fine though. Not sure if it was damaged from being in a pile or from me fixing audio.\n\nEdit:\nFAN_RT_PWM - 4.88v\nFAN_LT_PWM - 0v\n\nReplace Q6000 or is it something else?"
