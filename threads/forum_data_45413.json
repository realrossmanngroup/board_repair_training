        "message":"I have a 13\" touchbar here, it came in with liquid damage, and a blown J4402. The liquid damage was only seemingly to the touchbar connector J4402.\n\nReplaced J4402, and patched up and ran a jumper wire to pin 22 of the connector due to a blown out trace.\nTried booting the laptop to High sierra or Mojave, and the macbook gets most the way through the apple logo and goes black, sometimes with crazy artefacts on the screen (patches of green.ect)\nPasses apple hardware test with no issues found.\n\nas it is a file vault encrypted SSD i am able to get to there logon screen and boot into guest user mode, Guest user mode seems to work, and with touchbar functionality.\nIt will boot into recovery without any issues and work in recovery just fine. It just wont make it into OSX, and looks allot like GPU failure."
