When I try to measure ALL_SYS_PWRGD the fan instantly stopps spinning and the multimeter shows 0V.\nWhen I disconnect the power cable and reconnect it, the fan spins again. But when I measure the resistors R8169, R8165 or  R8168 at their pin 1 the fan always stops spinning. But not when I measure R8164, that one shows 3.3V at pin 1.\n\nWhat could be the reason for the fan stopping when voltages are measured?"

I mean the Big Samsung chip that is soldered on the original Samsung SSD. The same chip gets hot on a 100% known good SSD. While the same SSD does not get hot in a working macbook.\n\nI have measured voltages on the pins of the SSD connector. I have only a working 2015 13\" MBP for comparison. Most voltages are not identical but similar. The only big difference that I have measured is:\non the working board I have 0V on pin 50 and 3.35V on pin 52,\nwhile on the faulty board I have 3,27V on pin 50 and 0V on pin 52.\n\nOn some pins that have only mV values there are more differences."
