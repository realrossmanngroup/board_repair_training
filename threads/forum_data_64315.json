The 2 diodes were: DZF600 currently has no voltage, and DZF687 fluctuates around 1.2v. \nOther parts replaced:\n<CHIP>U5500</CHIP> twice\n<CAPACITOR>C5660</CAPACITOR> \n<CAPACITOR>C5500</CAPACITOR>\n<CAPACITOR>C5508</CAPACITOR>\n<CAPACITOR>C5505</CAPACITOR>\n<TRANSISTOR>Q5216</TRANSISTOR> (Purchased from digikey, consulted with an engineer since an exact match was not found, they said this should work).\n\nAll the pads east of CF813 were completley missing, I ran traces/pads to connect them all, RD671 pin 1 has 11.97v along with the traces/pads I replaced.\n<CAPACITOR>C5223</CAPACITOR> Is getting 5.1v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V8_S2_CHGR</SIGNAL> is 1.79v\nI did have the Magsafe light blinking the other day after having reflowed <CHIP>U5500</CHIP>, but because it was blinking, this is why I ended up replacing <CHIP>U5500</CHIP> twice as I specified above.\nI also had to repair the pad West of UF360 <SIGNAL>SPI_UPC1_MISO</SIGNAL> by running a jumper to RF362 pin 2.\nI am losing my mind with this board.
