General disruption all over the board, most disturbance is inside the case where he fan normally is. Cleaned board and looked again, even after cleaning L5001 looks burnt out, but beeped and about 3 ohms. Replaced anyway, now beeps at 2ohms.\nWith board back in computer, get fan spin, just green light and occasionally the charge symbol comes up on screen. At this time, the green light fades away on charger and no more. Am I right in saying the smc tells the light to go red therefore it could be an smc problem?\nc5001 and c5020 look quite bad as well, \nChecking for other voltages they are there so could it be anything else other than the smc? I have not yet checked for shorts to ground anywhere\nThanks again"}

Don't have another cable to try, but will get some. The connector on the logic board looks effected, the contacts look like hey have been hit with the liquid so I will investigate the connector and tracks that lead from it. What does the connector carry, just information to USB ports?\nThanks again"}
