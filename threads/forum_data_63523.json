I checked D7105, in diode mode I have 2.85V in one way and 2.27V in the other, so I believe it is dead (values on a good one: 3V and 0.25V)\nOn U7000, resistance on pin 2 is 2 ohm (expected 80 ohm) so I believe this ISL is also dead.\n\nIs there anything else I should check before replacing these 2, to avoid them frying again immediately? I don't see shorts on Q7130, resistance between pins 27\/28 is 20.8\u03a9"}
