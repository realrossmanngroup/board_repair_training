Tested it with a functional screen and cable, screen works!\nThe LVDS cable in the water damaged mac actually looked clean, so I decided to risk it and try it in the case it came out of, and it works too.\nRam slots are working fine too, turns out it was a bad ram stick which worked 'sometimes'.\n\nThis is only my third logic board repair (I've only done 'windows' laptops before) so I'm stoked!\nThanks, Duke!"
