I know people say this issue is a rabbit hole and I should junk it.  I've heated up the GPU with the JB for 2.5 minutes with 160 degree and still the same white screen.  Junk it?"

I think I've heard many times that reflowing doesn't do squat to these big chips unless you have the proper equipment.  I'll just put it back together and see. It's a practice board so not a big deal."

            "message": "Oh so it's actually the GPU not the crappy solder like the 2011 GPU recall?.  Ok got it.     Funny thing. I went around the board and touched up a few caps and components that looked suspect.  Now it boots and I've been running you tube and music on it for the day.  Now I know that this could be because I heated up the GPU and it's only temporary.  The thing is that I somehow lost trackpad and keyboard.  The power button works but trackpad and keyboard do not.  I'd really like to experiment with this and learn something.  I don't expect to get this going although I have 3 of these boards sitting here and wondering if I can practice reballing GPU's. Also this is just for practice and learning.\n\nQuestion: Is there one component that would fail to make both keyboard and trackpad not work? This board has separate flex's for the keyboard and Trackpad I'm wondering if it's just a component that could break both inputs at once?  I'm just looking for direction on where to start for keyboard and trackpad. USB works for mouse and keyboard FYI.  I'll look at the schematics and do my best but any help appreciated."
