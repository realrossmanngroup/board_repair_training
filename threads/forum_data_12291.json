The computer powers on, but when we go to run the internet diagnostic, it won't let us launch Apple internet diagnostic, because it reports there is an issue detected with wifi. We tried a different WLAN card, and got same error. Where would be a good place to start to troubleshoot this? \n\nThis is how the area looked before \n[url]http://imgur.com/nOPQT1l[/url]\n\nThis is how that corroded area looks now \n[url]http://imgur.com/EMbT24R[/url]"

They brought it to us, we replaced the keyboard connector, cleaned up the corrosion, and replaced that missing filter for the wifi issues.
