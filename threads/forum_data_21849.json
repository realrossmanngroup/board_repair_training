If it dims the screen, then someone popped the magnet out and didn't put it back while replacing the screen.\n\nIf that doesn't do it, check SMC_LID on the board when you put the magnet there. If it lowers, then it's a board issue, if it does not lower, then it is a battery indicator\/sleep sensor issue."}
