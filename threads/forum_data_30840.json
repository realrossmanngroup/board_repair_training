This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

Also there is no light on charger. also Mac works only from charger.\n\nI/O  board is good, flex between audio board and main board is also good.\n\nI need advice, how to find the cause? what signal is responsible fo battery % control?"
