AHT confirms the no Wi-Fi but this machine is newer than what I typically work on so I'm not sure where to start. No liquid damage, no other damage. Machine works great except Wi-Fi. Any pointers? :)\n\nLooking at the schematic there is a lot more involved with the Wi-Fi than prior years/models. Figured the first thing I'm looking for is an enable or power line but having a hard time finding it."
