So I tried booting into Mojave through USB and still flashes as well but boots into Sierra via USB but the thing is, it also does not want to boot into Sierra via SSD directly (flashing folder). Was liquid damaged but was cleaned (ultrasonic). Tried working SSDs, even installed Sierra on the same model MacBook Air and swapped the SSDs around."}

Already formatted the SSD, deleted volume, created a new partition. Ran out of ideas on what to do. The only way that this MacBook is usable is to use a bootable USB drive. Tried Internet recovery and same problem."}
