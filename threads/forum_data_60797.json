The when attempting to boot the board, it shows 20v in all ports with normal amp draw almost reaching 2.5A. (seems like it is booting). I tested voltages on CPU lines and CPU power supplies and everything appears normal.\n\nT2 Revive completes without any issue but does not fix the no boot issue.\n\nThe interesting thing is that the U1200 PCH gets EXTREMELY hot. I replaced U1200 from a 820-01700 donor board and the same exact issue persists, U1200 gets extremely hot. T2 revive still completes without issue, but logic board still does not boot.\n\nThe cpu\/gpu heat up as well but not even close to as hot as the PCH U1200.\n\nAny idea why the PCH is getting so hot? Seems like it is likely related to the problem in some way. Is this possibly a bad CPU causing it to get super hot?\n\nAny ideas\/troubleshooting would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!"}
