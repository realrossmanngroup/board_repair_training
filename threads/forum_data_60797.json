            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> that has no visible or accidental damage.\n\nThe symptoms were that the MacBook got really hot, shut down and will not turn back on.\n\nI have inspected the board closely and have been unable to find any damage or short circuits. The when attempting to boot the board, it shows 20v in all ports with normal amp draw almost reaching 2.5A. (seems like it is booting). I tested voltages on CPU lines and CPU power supplies and everything appears normal.\n\nT2 Revive completes without any issue but does not fix the no boot issue.\n\nThe interesting thing is that the <CHIP>U1200</CHIP> PCH gets EXTREMELY hot. I replaced <CHIP>U1200</CHIP> from a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-01700</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> donor board and the same exact issue persists, <CHIP>U1200</CHIP> gets extremely hot. T2 revive still completes without issue, but logic board still does not boot.\n\nThe cpu/gpu heat up as well but not even close to as hot as the PCH <CHIP>U1200</CHIP>.\n\nAny idea why the PCH is getting so hot? Seems like it is likely related to the problem in some way. Is this possibly a bad CPU causing it to get super hot?\n\nAny ideas/troubleshooting would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!"
