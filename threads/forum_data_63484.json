            "message": "I have a 2021 16\" <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-02100</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that is liquid damaged. It only had some light corrosion around UD102 area and pin 32 on the keyboard connector, which was for <SIGNAL>PP3V3_AON_KBD_CONN</SIGNAL>. I cleaned the corrosion and replaced some resistors and caps. The mac turns on and makes the chime nosie and I can see the apple logo on the screen, but no backlight on the screen. Then the image goes away completely and it just stays like that, until I press the power button once. Then the screen turns on with image and backlight now, and shows the login screen, but keyboard and trackpad do not work. Also, the screen keeps flickering on and off randomly. I checked the board outside of the case with only the charger and trackpad connected and it appears I am missing <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_IPD</SIGNAL>. This comes from UT390, and I have 3.8v on <SIGNAL>PP3V8_IPDLDO_VIN</SIGNAL> and 1.75v on <SIGNAL>IPD_P3V3_PWR_EN_RC</SIGNAL>, so the chip is being powered and told to turn on, but no output. <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_IPD</SIGNAL> is .411 in diode mode, so no short. I replaced UT390, but still have 0v on <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_IPD</SIGNAL>, and I do not know why. Any ideas?\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V8_IPDLDO_VIN</SIGNAL> - 3.8v\n<SIGNAL>IPD_P3V3_PWR_EN_RC</SIGNAL> - 1.75v\n[COLOR=rgb(209, 72, 65)][B]<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S2_IPD</SIGNAL> - 0v[/B][/COLOR]\n<SIGNAL>PP1V85_S2_IPD</SIGNAL> - 1.85v\n<SIGNAL>PP1V2_S2</SIGNAL> - 1.2v\n<SIGNAL>IPD_LID_OPEN_1V8</SIGNAL> - 1.8v\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S2_TPAD_CONN</SIGNAL> - 5.0v"

The trackpad does not even click, so it seemed like its not getting power at all. I checked all the traces and they seemed fine, so I suspected the trackpad was bad. Got a new trackpad and tested it, but still had the same issue. It ended up being a faulty lid angle sensor on the screen that was causing all these issues. I replaced the lid angle sensor and everything is working fine now."
