            "message": "Working on an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3115</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board that had exactly 2 drops of liquid--one to clock/vrtc area, and one directly on probe point 502, next to <RESISTOR>R1894</RESISTOR>. The pad is 100% gone. No visible \"head\" of trace underneath either, just gone. I scraped a bit, but there's no hope. Was going to run a wire, but this signal only appears at this probe point and under the PCH. Damn.\n\nLooking at the schematics, this signal (<SIGNAL>PCH_CLK100M_SATA_N</SIGNAL>) is under a section called \"unused clock terminations for FCIM mode\". Does this mean this signal (and by proxy, this probe point) isn't necessary? I assume it is, and if it is, can I attach any other line (that comes up at the same time) to this resistor to accomplish the same function? It would be a shame to toss the board into the parts pile over this minor damage.\n\nAny advice? Thanks in advance, as always."

My concern is that the damage will manifest in some weird issues that aren't immediately noticeable in testing. If the unit will work fine without that one trace, then I'll just get it back out and see if it comes back."
