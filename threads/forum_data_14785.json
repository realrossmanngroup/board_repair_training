        "message":"Hello, on this 820-00165 PP3V42 is 1,394V. Resistance to GND is 0,309V. SMC_BC_ACOK is 1,38V and resistance to GND is 0,465. I checked U7000 area, because the two signals show up there together. R7101 has 5V on both sides, CHGR_ACIN is 4,3V, CHGR_DCIN is 16,6V so everything looks fine here for me. Pins 2 (PP3V42) and 4 of J6100 look a little burned (just a little black touch, but visible). Also U6100 Pin 1-4 look a little bad. (as if there is nearly no solder on them compared to Pins 5-8) but maybe thats just my eyes tricking me. The machine was used in a \"slightly wet\" environment (tropic climate), but no evidence of water. his is one of the cleanest machines\/ boards i\u00b4ve ever seen."

It should be in my \"820-2330 no green light\" post i also have open right now. I posted it there now. Meanwhile i could fix this one. I don\u00b4t know how i could miss this the first time. It was a dead U7090. 16V at Pin 6 and 8 and no output. So sorry again for wasting your time and thank you very much for the help!"
