        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U6100": "What is U6100? this is an SPI ROM chip that holds the BIOS which is necessary for the machine to POST or try and power on..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "CHGR_ACIN": "What is CHGR_ACIN? CHGR_ACIN is a signal that is created by a voltage divider between the charger and ground that goes into the ISL6258, ISL6259, ISL9239, or ISL9240 chip that creates PPBUS_G3H. It is necessary for SMC_BC_ACOK & CHGR_ACOK to be present so that the onewire circuit is told to turn on & allow the SMC to speak to the charger..",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",

Resistance to GND is 0,309V. <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> is 1,38V and resistance to GND is 0,465. I checked <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> area, because the two signals show up there together. <RESISTOR>R7101</RESISTOR> has 5V on both sides, <SIGNAL>CHGR_ACIN</SIGNAL> is 4,3V, <SIGNAL>CHGR_DCIN</SIGNAL> is 16,6V so everything looks fine here for me. Pins 2 (PP3V42) and 4 of J6100 look a little burned (just a little black touch, but visible). Also <CHIP>U6100</CHIP> Pin 1-4 look a little bad. (as if there is nearly no solder on them compared to Pins 5-8) but maybe thats just my eyes tricking me. The machine was used in a \"slightly wet\" environment (tropic climate), but no evidence of water. his is one of the cleanest machines/ boards i´ve ever seen."

It should be in my \"<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2330</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> no green light\" post i also have open right now. I posted it there now. Meanwhile i could fix this one. I don´t know how i could miss this the first time. It was a dead <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>. 16V at Pin 6 and 8 and no output. So sorry again for wasting your time and thank you very much for the help!"
