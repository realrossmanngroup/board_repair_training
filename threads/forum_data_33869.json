            "message": "hi, i have a macbook air early 2014 which was water damaged , i fixed it few days ago and it was working fine until yesterday, now sometimes its having 1/4 fan spin and sometimes nothing happens, the charger has orange ligjht. i was checking schematics and have few problems with it;\nthe schematic shows that <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL</SIGNAL> should have 18.5 volts but i am only getting 15 volts on it. On <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL>  i am getting 3.3 volts.\nThe water damage was around smc reset circuit and rtc circuit.\ncan any one tell me exact voltages that i should get on these rails under normal circumsatnces?\nif i leave charger connected for few minutes, <CHIP>U3900</CHIP> gets warm\nany help will be appreciated.\nthanks"

Also crap under SMC is common. It all depends on where the original corrosion was.\n\n15V on DCIN is fine and will not affect anything, schematic is lazy and states voltage for a 60W charger instead of 45W"
