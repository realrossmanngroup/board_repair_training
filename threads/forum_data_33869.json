On PPVRTC_G3H  i am getting 3.3 volts.\nThe water damage was around smc reset circuit and rtc circuit.\ncan any one tell me exact voltages that i should get on these rails under normal circumsatnces?\nif i leave charger connected for few minutes, u3900 gets warm\nany help will be appreciated.\nthanks"}

The usual suspects are U1900, U1950, U6100 area and the \"termination resistors\" and traces to them. Also crap under SMC is common. It all depends on where the original corrosion was.\n\n15V on DCIN is fine and will not affect anything, schematic is lazy and states voltage for a 60W charger instead of 45W"}
