Actually <SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> is not present (I read 0). \n\n<SIGNAL>PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H</SIGNAL> is present when the charger or the battery are connected (with the charger I read 16,48V).\n\nOn pin 8 and 2 of <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> I can read 3,86V (<SIGNAL>P3V42G3H_FB</SIGNAL>), but the output of <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> is 0.\n\nIf a use a multimeter in diode mode on the output (red on ground and black on pin) I read 0,001 so I think I have a shortcut somewhere.\n\nWhat is the best way to go on? Removing one by one the components on the line to find the one failing on injecting some power to find (I hope) the one heating?\n\nIs the time worth or the shortcut on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> could have destroyed the board?\n\nThanks"
