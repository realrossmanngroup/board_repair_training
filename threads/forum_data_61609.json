The only key combination that is working is SHIFT+CONTROL+OPTION to reset the SMC, but I think that it's working becuse the Macbook is off, as soon as I turn it on, nothing works.\n\nYes, I've already reset the NVRAM with the external keyboard, and re-seated the keyboard flex and trackpad ribbon and still nothing."
