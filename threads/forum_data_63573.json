        "A1989": "What is A1989? A1989 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years 2018, 2019 with EMC 3124, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00850..",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP5V_G3S": "What is PP5V_G3S? PP5V_G3S is a 5v power rail present when the system is in a G3S standby state.",
        "PP3V3_G3H_RTC": "What is PP3V3_G3H_RTC? PP3V3_G3H_RTC Is one of the first rails that has to come on in order for the USB-C mux chip to be powered in the T2 chip Macbook Pros..",

        "PP1V8_AWAKE": "What is PP1V8_AWAKE? The PP1V8_AWAKE signal in the MacBook schematic is indicative of a power rail that delivers 1.8 volts when the machine is in an \"awake\" state. This is not a traditional power state defined in the older Intel PCH documentation; it seems to be specific to newer MacBook architectures. The \"awake\" designation likely refers to a state where the MacBook is on and ready for user interaction, but it is not necessarily at full operational capacity (which would be denoted by an S0 state).",
        "PP1V1_SLPS2R": "What is PP1V1_SLPS2R? The PP1V1_SLPS2R power rail in the MacBook schematic provides a 1.1-volt supply in a specific low-power state indicated by the \"_SLPS2R\" suffix and is used for powering the T2 chip..",
