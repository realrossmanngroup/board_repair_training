        "Q9706": "What is Q9706? Q9706 takes PPBUS_G3H's vltage and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q9706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R9788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q9706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",

Here, “LCD_BKLT” which stands for “LCD screen backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",

            "message": "Replacing <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> makes no sense here. <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> takes <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>'s main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> is not opening, then you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. We can't blame <CHIP>U9701</CHIP> for not working and replace it when it isn't receiving the power required to turn on. This is like changing a lightbulb while the switch is set to off. Turn the switch on, [I]then[/I] see if the lightbulb works.\n\nSo why isnt <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> sending power to the backlight circuit? <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. <RESISTOR>R9788</RESISTOR> takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate ate identical.\n\nHow would we lover the voltage on <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR>'s gate at pin 3 so that it will turn on? Look at <RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR>. If we take <RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR> and put it to ground right after <RESISTOR>R9788</RESISTOR> now we have a voltage divider. Voltage dividers lower voltage! A hah. So why isn't it lowering? <RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR> needs a path to ground in order for <RESISTOR>R9788</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR> to [I]be [/I]a voltage divider. What gives <RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR> a path to ground? <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR>.\n\n<TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> is the opposite of <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR>. It's an N channel MOSFET. It will turn \"on\" when the power on the gate is equal to or higher than the source. <SIGNAL>BKLT_PLT_RST_L</SIGNAL>, once it is 3.3v, ,will be higher than the 0v(ground) on pin 1, which will open the first transistor. <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL>, when 3.3v, will be higher than the 0v on the source(ground pin 4) and open the second transistor. This will give <RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR> a path to ground, making <RESISTOR>R9788</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R9789</RESISTOR> a voltage divider, which will lower the voltage on pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR> to around 5v, which will allow it to open.\n\nBefore this occurs, there is no point in troubleshooting anything after <TRANSISTOR>Q9706</TRANSISTOR>. It just won't work.\n\n<SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> is missing in your case. This comes from <CHIP>U9600</CHIP>. What does <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> do? Look at the beginning of the schematic. This is responsible for taking the video signal from the integrated intel graphics & the AMD GPU and sending it off to either displayport external screen or internal LCD. <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> is going to be responsible for brightness control, as well as turning the screen on. So let's go over the cases under which <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> might not send out <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL>.\n\nAnytime you see an image and <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is high - meaning, the machine does not think the lid is closed, <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> should be high as well. Is <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> a solid 3.4v? If it is, and you are doing something with the machine like clicking the mouse or touching the keyboard, then <SIGNAL>LCD_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> should be present. If not, try resetting PRAM. This always fixes it for duke because he's luckier than I am - I always wind up having a fucked up mux. :( If it isn't a low <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> value, or a PRAM reset, then <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> is the next culprit.\n\nIf you want to \"cheat\" and see if the rest of the backlight circuit works, you can wire pin 5 of <TRANSISTOR>Q9707</TRANSISTOR> and pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R9704</RESISTOR>. If you get a backlight then it is most likely a <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> issue. This is obviously a cancerous thing to do because you will have full brightness all the time, but allows you to see that the rest of everything in front of <CHIP>U9600</CHIP> is working.\n\nMost likely replacing a <CHIP>U9600</CHIP>, which of course comes with firmware, which means salvaging one from a donor board and reballing it, which is a horrorshow. and then selling to the customer that you're not refunding them for the board repair when the GPU dies a month later. I don't envy you right now. ;)\n\nAs duke said, there has to be a logical reason to everything. If you don't get it, post, but replacing chips that aren't even getting power and hoping it turns on is the opposite of the logical reasoning required to fix this."

Also i will replace gpu for customer any way when i get delivery from china after chines new year with new machine zm-<RESISTOR>R6200C</RESISTOR>.
