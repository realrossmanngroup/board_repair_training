    "definitions": {
        "820-3437": "What is 820-3437? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_FET": "What is PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_FET? a SIGNAL.",
        "Q7706": "What is Q7706? Q7706 takes PPBUS_G3H's main 12.6v and sends it through to the backlight circuit. If Q9706 is not allowing PPBUS_G3H through, you will get no voltage on the backlight circuit. Q7706 is a P channel MOSFET, meaning power will flow through it when the voltage on the gate is lower than on the source. Look at pin 3. R7788 takes the 12.6v that is on the source and places it right on pin 3. This will set Q7706 to \"off\", and not allow it to pass power, as the voltage on the source and the gate are identical..",
        "Q7707": "What is Q7707? a TRANSISTOR.",
        "PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT": "What is PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT? PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the backlight on the LCD screen, this is necessary to get the screen to light up..",
        "PLT_RESET_L": "What is PLT_RESET_L? PLT_RESET_L is platform reset, this signal keeps the system from POSTing. _L means the signal is asserted when its voltage is low. .",
        "PP5V_S4RS3": "What is PP5V_S4RS3? PP5V_S4RS3 is a 5v power rail present when the machine is in an S4 suspend to disk state..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "3V3_S5": "What is 3V3_S5? 3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S5 are interchangeable, see definition for PP3V3_S5. .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "5V_S4": "What is 5V_S4? This is an abbreviation of “PP5V_S4” – when you see this, assume the person typing it meant to type “PP5V_S4”."

            "message": "Afterlight liquid spill, device powers on with green/orange light, and we get fan spin, but absolutely no image and no backlight visible. Took a few board measurements and tested that all power rails were present, until I noticed 0.001V present on <SIGNAL>PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_FET</SIGNAL>. So far, there is 8.6V present on pin 4 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7707</TRANSISTOR>, and also 8.6V present on pin 3 of <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>. I probably am misunderstanding this, but doesnt there have to be a negative voltage difference between gate and source to allow transistor to turn on and allow power to flow through <TRANSISTOR>Q7706</TRANSISTOR>? I can provide other measurements if you need, but am not sure what may be the problem or where else to test. Any help is greatly appreciated!!"

If I am not mistaken, this signal comes from the charging port, so I replaced with a known-good charging board but still same issue. Do not measure a short on that line. Not sure what to do from here, but not getting the same results as yesterday and am stuck again. Thanks again for the help."
