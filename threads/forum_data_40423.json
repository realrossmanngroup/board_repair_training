        "820-00163": "What is 820-00163? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PP5V_S5": "What is PP5V_S5? This is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 soft off state..",
        "D7105": "What is D7105? Diodes between PPDCIN_G3H charger voltage and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, when CHGR_DCIN Is low(less than charger voltage) and PPBUS_G3H is missing this is a critical point to troubleshoot.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PPV5_S5": "What is PPV5_S5? a SIGNAL.",
        "C5125": "What is C5125? a CAPACITOR.",
        "C7190": "What is C7190? a CAPACITOR.",
        "U7100": "What is U7100? U7100 refers to the ISL6259 or ISL9239 charging IC on Macbooks from 2013 to the present.",
        "CHGR_DCIN": "What is CHGR_DCIN? CHGR_DCIN comes directly from charger into ISL6258 or ISL6259, the resistor before it can be blown when there are surges. Should be checked when PPBUS_G3H is missing.",
        "R7105": "What is R7105? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running.."
