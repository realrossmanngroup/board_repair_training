        "A1707": "What is A1707? A1707 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3072, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00281, 820-00928..",
        "820-00281": "What is 820-00281? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "CD3215": "What is CD3215? This is a USB-C muxing chip responsible for USB-C communication with devices such as the laptop charger. The most common issue this chip is involved in is when a Macbook wonâ€™t charge or the charger is stuck at 5v instead of going to 20v..",
        "R4911": "What is R4911? a RESISTOR.",
        "ISL9239": "What is ISL9239? This is a charging chip for Macbook motherboards from 2016-2018 responsible for charging the battery and creating the power rail PPBUS_G3H.",
        "SMC_DCIN_ISENSE": "What is SMC_DCIN_ISENSE? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_BMON_ISENSE": "What is SMC_BMON_ISENSE? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",
        "R7061": "What is R7061? a RESISTOR.",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "CD3125": "What is CD3125? This is a common typo,  the person typing CD3125 was most likely referring to CD3215.",
        "PP3V3_G3H": "What is PP3V3_G3H? PP3V3_G3H is a 3.3v power line that is present when the machine is in a Global System Hardware Off state, and should come on before most other rails so that the USB-C circuitry can be powered for the charger.",
        "PP3V3_UPC_TA_LDO": "What is PP3V3_UPC_TA_LDO? PP3V3_UPC_TA_LDO is an LDO coming out of the CD3215 USB-C muxing chip. When this is missing, either a capacitor on the line has shorted, PP3V3_G3H is missing, or the CD3215 is bad.."

            "message": "<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00281</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> i fixed around 18 months ago for minor liquid damage has come back to me.\nI originally fixed the board by running pin 2 <RESISTOR>R4911</RESISTOR> to Debug power button, at the time of doing this no schematics were available and pin 1 of <RESISTOR>R4911</RESISTOR> was completely destroyed, so running to the debug power pads was the only option i had.\n\nIt has worked well since the above repair until now. Now it works however its not behaving like it should! When the charger is plugged in, sometimes DCIN pulses between 5V and 20V, this seems inconsistent, sometimes it will work for hours, sometimes it wont post.\n\nWhen running of the battery with a charger plugged in it behaves normally for a few hours and then goes into some sort of quarter fan spin pulse. Originally i suspected an issue with <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>'s however it seems to still be going into a quarter fan spin cycle with the charger unplugged. With the charger unplugged G3H remains constant and so does battery voltage, but everything S5 and beyond seems to pulse.\n\nI can recreate this fault without fail by trying to do a clean install on the device. \nDoes anyone know if when a <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> fails if the machine will run normally off the battery?\nOne thing ive noticed is that the battery cycles have not increase since the original repair around 18 months ago, suggesting it has been ran on its charger for almost its entire lifetime."

When this happens all power rails other than CPU-Vcore pulse. I belive it is caused by some USB C charging issue maybe.
