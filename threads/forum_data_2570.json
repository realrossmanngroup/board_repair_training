Now its in my hands trying to figure out what is causing the mouse and keyboard to freeze. It turns on fine but the screen will go white for 5 seconds then wheel spins, after that the desktop shows but mouse and keyboard stops working. My customer replaced the hard drive and same problem, i ran asd on efi and  test passed any ideas on what could cause this."}

But upon further testing the usb ports are completely down, i tested the keyboard controller chip U5701 for power at pins 22 and 49 for pp3v3. i get like 3.28 volts which is pretty close but upon further inspection of the board, l2 computer fucked with U3700 and a bunch of other components in that area i tested U3700 For power and it also has pp3v3 present. Is it possible one of these chips are faulty? i don't have a matching board to try it out."}

Is the mouse working in EFI mode?Is it getting stucked like in OSX?\nDid you run ASD OS? Do you have the same problem like in OS X\nDid you try replacing ram modules?Did you try with another HDD or SDD? When you get wheel spinning could be because of ram or hdd most of the times.\nDo you get any light from an external mouse when you plug in into the usb ports? Which ones are working?Which ones are not?"}
