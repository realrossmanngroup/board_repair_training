        "message":"Hey guys, \n\nRecently a customer brought in a 820-3330 board with a getting stuck periodically problem, after some cleaning around the ram slots and the ram themselves the machine worked properly for a couple of months and then was brought back with another issue. It had no image on the lcd. Works fine with an external monitor, charges, chimes etc.\n\nWhile doing some measurements around the lcd connector area, i found out that lcd_pwr_en is missing (?). I replaced u9000 still no change.\nU9600 is supposed to be the ic generating that voltage right?\nAm i just supposed to change that off a donor board or is there something else i should check first?\nAlready tried a different screen assembly."

The voltages were the ones i described even though it made absolutely no sense. Anyhow, we can count this one as solved and hopefully it will help someone with the same issue. That L8606 is right in the middle of the board and apparently if you are not the one disassembling the machine, things can get knocked off.\nThank you for all your help."
