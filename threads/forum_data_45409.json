It had no image on the lcd. Works fine with an external monitor, charges, chimes etc.\n\nWhile doing some measurements around the lcd connector area, i found out that <SIGNAL>LCD_PWR_EN</SIGNAL> is missing (?). I replaced <CHIP>U9000</CHIP> still no change.\n<CHIP>U9600</CHIP> is supposed to be the ic generating that voltage right?\nAm i just supposed to change that off a donor board or is there something else i should check first?\nAlready tried a different screen assembly."

The voltages were the ones i described even though it made absolutely no sense. Anyhow, we can count this one as solved and hopefully it will help someone with the same issue. That L8606 is right in the middle of the board and apparently if you are not the one disassembling the machine, things can get knocked off.\nThank you for all your help."
