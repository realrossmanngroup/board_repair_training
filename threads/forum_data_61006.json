        "message":"Hi.\n\nI have this laptop which the client said the screen was showing purple lines on screen when on 45' angle but since he got it here the laptop didn't show picture at all only backlight. I measured j8500 and on pin 6 with diode mode the value seems high 1.600 so i followed the line to R0557 which should be 100k but when measured on the board it's 47k. I removed it and it's 100k when not soldered and the value on board stays the same. R4830 it's measuring fine. Any ideas please? \n\nThanks :D"
