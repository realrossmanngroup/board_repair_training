I measured j8500 and on pin 6 with diode mode the value seems high 1.600 so i followed the line to <RESISTOR>R0557</RESISTOR> which should be 100k but when measured on the board it's 47k. I removed it and it's 100k when not soldered and the value on board stays the same. <RESISTOR>R4830</RESISTOR> it's measuring fine. Any ideas please? \n\nThanks :D"
