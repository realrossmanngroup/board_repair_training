        "message":"Hi all,\n\n\n\nThis is a liquid damaged board but tiny bit near the lcd connector. I check the LCD  with working board and LCD by itself is fine. I replaced the LCD flex cable still the same with damaged board.\n\nmacbook works fine with external monitor. but with the internal display not sure if this is only backlight or no display as really hard to see  the picture on this model LCD's.\n\nI checked backlight circuit. \n\nU8400 get current sensing power 12.66\/12.67v on pin 9\/10. But EDP_BKLT_EN signal is missing.  diod mode its 0.372v.\\\n\nBKLT_SD is 12.67v and q8400 not opeing the gate.\n\nCheck on J8500 LCD connector . There is 5v on PP5V_S0SW_LCD\non pin 45.\n\nAny clue?"
