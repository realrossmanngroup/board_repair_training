        "A1707": "What is A1707? A1707 is a model number for a 15 inch size MacBook Pro Retina from years Late 2016, Mid 2017 with EMC 3072, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00281, 820-00928..",

        "EDP_BKLT_EN": "What is EDP_BKLT_EN? This is an enable signal. Anytime you see “_EN”, it means when the voltage is high(3.3 volts), whatever it is going to is being turned on or enabled. Here, “EDP_BKLT” which stands for “embedded displayport backlight” is being enabled. This signal usually goes to an LED driver used for creating a power rail for the LCD screen backlight, to tell it to turn on & create this rail. .",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",

I replaced the LCD flex cable still the same with damaged board.\n\nmacbook works fine with external monitor. but with the internal display not sure if this is only backlight or no display as really hard to see  the picture on this model LCD's.\n\nI checked backlight circuit. \n\n<CHIP>U8400</CHIP> get current sensing power 12.66/12.67v on pin 9/10. But <SIGNAL>EDP_BKLT_EN</SIGNAL> signal is missing.  diod mode its 0.372v.\\\n\n<SIGNAL>BKLT_SD</SIGNAL> is 12.67v and <TRANSISTOR>Q8400</TRANSISTOR> not opeing the gate.\n\nCheck on J8500 LCD connector . There is 5v on <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0SW_LCD</SIGNAL>\non pin 45.\n\nAny clue?"
