I replaced all the components (resistors and capacitor).\n\nIt worked well for 2 days, but now it doesn't charge the battery (Mac recognizes the charger) and the ports on the left don't work with accessories (pendrive, HD).\n\nI checked everything near the U3500 and I don't have 5v on the L3500 with accessories connected.\n\nSome help?"}
