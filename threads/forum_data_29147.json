When the fan starts spinning the green light cycles from on and off every couple of seconds and then turns solid eventually the fan then spins at like maximum rpm (the chipset SLJBC gets really warm which I why I believe that might be)\nIn all cases (green light or no):\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is present.\nPP3V42 is present.\nNo display in LCD.\n\nThank you,\nSam"
