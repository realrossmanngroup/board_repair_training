        "message":"Appreciate any and all help, thanks!\n\nSo I've got a logic board where the board turns on (and green light is displayed) randomly meaning I have to plug in and out the charger before it suddenly turns on. When the fan starts spinning the green light cycles from on and off every couple of seconds and then turns solid eventually the fan then spins at like maximum rpm (the chipset SLJBC gets really warm which I why I believe that might be)\nIn all cases (green light or no):\nPPBUS_G3H is present.\nPP3V42 is present.\nNo display in LCD.\n\nThank you,\nSam"
