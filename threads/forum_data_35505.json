The charge port cable had a corroded pin, swapped that out. The Mac does not start. I know I need 20V on F4700 pin 1. What I get there is a voltage between 0-5v thats seems to turn on and off rapidly, unlike in the video from Louis where it showed a stable 5V. What could be the issue? It looks like no liquid has reached the logicboard, checked carefully with a microscope. The OAN line is also pulsing, between 0-2.9v."}

No short on F4700 and diode measurement gives me 0.546v on pin 1. Will got through all rails now to check for a short and report back."}
