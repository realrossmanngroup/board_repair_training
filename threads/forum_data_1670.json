To confirm that my process is not bullshit, I would go back and reball the chip I removed, put it back on, and now it went back to working the way it did before. It worked fucked up but at least it worked.. all those MCP79 I were buying had no video/chime, the MCP89 were just dead, the graphics chips were garbage. I'm done with that shit. If I am going to steal chips to put them on boards and waste a hour of time on it it'd better be chips I got for free, and stuff I can do in a few minutes or less. I find BGA rework to be a colossal waste of time. \n\nIf you're going to try soldering a GPU by hand you are going to fail really miserably. I am not saying that to encourage you to prove me wrong, I am saying that to keep you from wasting a fuckton of time on something that is fundamentally destined to fail. Even the people with years of experience who are highly capable would have issues doing that. If you don't have years of experience doing large chip BGA rework you will find it hard to do with the $9000 machine, much less a $100 aoyue.\n\nNext board!"
