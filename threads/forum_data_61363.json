I\u2019m wondering if anyone can help me with a knowledge gap I have that can either point me in the right direction or explain the following to me! \n\nThe device: A1706 820-00236 \nThe issue: short to ground on PPBUSG3H \nWhat caused the short: failed cap. Cap specs: 33uf 16v 20% \nMy questions I can only get my hands on 47uf caps in 10 packs from mobile sentrix. Is this the case, because one size fits all?\n\nI\u2019m a little lost why I can find multiple different spec and sizes caps for sale in bulk. Is harvesting a cap from the same spot on the same model device, same spec the only way to ensure you\u2019re using 100% the right one. On that same PPBUS line there is a cap that is 2.2uf 25v 20% totally different physical size as well. So far anytime I have a short on VCC main or PPBUS etc I just leave the caps off. I\u2019ve been doing this for years and have no issues with this though I want to understand why.\n\nThanks in advance! \n\nMax"}
