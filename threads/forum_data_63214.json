        "message":"Hey Guys, \n\nSevere Liquid damaged 820-01700-A. Came in with 5v on charger. \n\nCleaned corrosion and replaced U9580 as it was cracked. Now getting 20V 0.2A on charger. \n\npp2v5_NAND_SSD0 is shorted to ground. \n\nRemoved L9580 & L9581 to isolate short.\n\nRemoved U9580, still shorted. \n\nRemoved some suspicious looking caps on that line, no change. \n\nInjected 2.5V, the Nand get hot but nothing else. \n\nI'm pretty sure U9100 NAND is the problem but unsure how i can test further without removing it. \n\nPlease advise."
