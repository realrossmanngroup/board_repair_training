Came in with 5v on charger. \n\nCleaned corrosion and replaced <CHIP>U9580</CHIP> as it was cracked. Now getting 20V 0.2A on charger. \n\n<SIGNAL>PP2V5_NAND_SSD0</SIGNAL> is shorted to ground. \n\nRemoved L9580 & L9581 to isolate short.\n\nRemoved <CHIP>U9580</CHIP>, still shorted. \n\nRemoved some suspicious looking caps on that line, no change. \n\nInjected 2.5V, the Nand get hot but nothing else. \n\nI'm pretty sure <CHIP>U9100</CHIP> NAND is the problem but unsure how i can test further without removing it. \n\nPlease advise."
