Basically the Intel HD3000 isn't working properly. \n\nI replaced the GMUX suspecting that to be the cause, but nope, it didnt resolve anything. Im starting to think it could be a cold joint under the PCH or something. But its really messing with my head. \nAnyone seen this before?"}

I took a risk and reflowed the whole board in my reflow oven at a high temp. (dont do this ppl) I was out of options. Board worked !!  Its been gone for 7 weeks now."}

If it really got to the point of melting the solder the board would have been totally fucked. Also without flux it would be pointless."}

Youre a star, i would have been chasing that for a long time.\n\nIm still madly confused as to how it went bad, no liquid on this board.ect. overall pretty happy though! :)"}
