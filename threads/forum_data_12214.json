This resistor blows when C6990 has shorted to ground or U6990 has shorted to ground, and will result in PP3V42_G3H missing and the magsafe charger not having a light since PP3V42_G3H is necessary for the SMC to turn on and the onewire circuit to turn on..",

I have board <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2915</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-b and when i open it <DIODE>D6990</DIODE> and <RESISTOR>R6990</RESISTOR> was burned out. i replaced <CHIP>U6990</CHIP>, <RESISTOR>R6990</RESISTOR>, <DIODE>D6990</DIODE> but now when i connect charger smoke coming out from <RESISTOR>R6990</RESISTOR>. Also i have short on <CHIP>U6990</CHIP> pin 4 and pin 7. Anybody can help?"
