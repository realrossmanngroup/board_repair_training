It turns on, the fan spins normally first then starts spinning faster, it charge, there is mouse activity, but there is no video, no chime and I noticed that the  PCH gets hot when it is on, also I found a short to GND on PP3v3_s0, and since there are so many parts involved on that rail I don't know where to start with. there is no sign of liquid or any part burned. Thanks in advance.\n\nBR"}
