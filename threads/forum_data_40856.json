The fans started spinning fast after i assembled it back.\nran asd and it showed \nta0p\ntc0p\nth0p\ntm0p failed smc i/o.\n\ni have replaced <CHIP>U5511</CHIP> and checked all the resistors but everything looks fine, i even compared values of <TRANSISTOR>Q5520</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q5510</TRANSISTOR>,<TRANSISTOR>Q5515</TRANSISTOR> with working board and they all are same but fans are constantly spinning on high rpm.\nr"
