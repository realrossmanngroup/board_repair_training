The thermal sesnors are shown on page 48 of the schematics (use Google to find it).\nThere are two IC chips: U5850 and U5870. To these ICs many sensors are attached.\nU58050 is connected to \"GPU PROXIMITY\/GPU DIE\/LEFT FIN STACK\/RIGHT FIN STACK\". This is most probably what you're interested into, because even though the names are weird, GPU is mentioned and these left and right stack could be heat pipes incoming and outcoming air.\n\nPerform visual inspection around the chip and its resistors and lines. Then measure resistance and see if any resistor is in bad condition.\n\nEDIT: You can also check this out: [MEDIA=youtube]yuunAVCAd0g[\/MEDIA]"}

Now it works sometimes and Heatpipe Temp Values look good (GPU2 still at 130\u00b0C but system is not slow and fan spin goes down to 2k rpm with low Heatpipe values) most of the time but it still jumps sometimes from 30\u00b0C to 130\u00b0C... Already tried a known working trackpad with the same result. Maybe I should try another trackpad flex? Before I can do this I need to order one :)"}
