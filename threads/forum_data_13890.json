Could do with a helping hand!\n\nThese are my test results / notes:\n\n<SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> = 14.8v SCHEMATIC SAYS 18.5v ??\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> = 8.35v SCHEMATIC SAYS 8.4V\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> = 3.29v SCHEMATIC SAYS 3.42v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> = 3.2v SCHEMATIC SAYS 3.3v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S3</SIGNAL> = -- SCHEMATIC SAYS 3.3v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> = -- SCHEMATIC SAYS 5v\n\n<RESISTOR>R7910</RESISTOR> Pin1 = 3.26v Pin2 = 3.11v 47k ohm tested ok\n<CAPACITOR>C7911</CAPACITOR> Pin1 = 3.29v Pin2 = 3.17v\n<CAPACITOR>C7910</CAPACITOR> Pin1 = 3.1v Pin2 = 0v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7903</TRANSISTOR> Pin1 = 0v Pin2=G Pin3 = 3.25v\n<TRANSISTOR>Q7910</TRANSISTOR> Pin 4 = 3.29v Pin 3 = 3.11v Pin1,2,5,6 = 0v\n\nThere is no obvious water damage to the board and everything looks great and very clean.\n\nAm I right in thinking the next step is to replace <TRANSISTOR>Q7910</TRANSISTOR>?\n\nOf course, I could be mis-reading the schematic entirely and have the completely wrong end of the stick...\n\nCheers\n\nStewart"

I will have to wait to test it once I get the rest of the machine sorted, also waiting for some donor boards to replace a couple of caps.\n\nAm I right in thinking that my logic was nearly correct? The voltage at the gate was only slightly lower than the source but it was looking for 0v aka <SIGNAL>P3V3S3_EN_L</SIGNAL> so it could open? From my tests this seems the case.\n\nAlso is this expected / normal? <SIGNAL>PPDCIN_G3H</SIGNAL> = 14.8v SCHEMATIC SAYS 18.5v"
