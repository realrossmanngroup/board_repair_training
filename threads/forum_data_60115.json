        "message":"Hey guys! I have a 820-4924 with no backlight.\n\nSmall notes: LCD is good, tried it on another 2015 macbook pro and full image with backlight, so narrowing it down to the motherboard issue.\nShined a light behind it, can see the apple logo and then the users profile icon and name. Webcam is also working.\n\nJ8300:\nvoltage\/ohms PIN 1 - 0V \/ 300hms\nvoltage\/ohms PIN 2 - 0v \/ OL\nvoltage\/ohms PIN 3 - 4.6V \/ OL\nvoltage\/ohms PIN 4 - 4.6V \/ OL\n\nWhat else should I be checking for?"

        "message":"\"voltage\/ohms PIN 1 - 0V \/ 300hms\"\nCompare this reading with the working board; in same conditions!\n300 ohm seems to be low.\nAnd check in diode mode, not ohm scale; red probe connected to ground.\nOhm scale is ONLY used for low indications on diode mode; like CPU\/GPU coils."
