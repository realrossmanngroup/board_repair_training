        "message":"Hi,\nI have an 820-01041 that is really playing with my nerves.\nIt was liquid damaged on the edge where the air intakes are.\nInitially I was getting 5V only. The 1.1V LDO line was not coming on.\nIt had a shorted capacitor on the SSD rail. Replaced it and a few others that looked nasty and got it to turn on.\nI had to clean the CD3215 area as well and replaced a few tiny parts that looked off to play safe.\n\nThat was last night.\nI got the laptop to turn on with the user password prompt so I turned it off, put it for charge overnight and asked customer about his password to run some tests in the morning.\nMorning it wouldn't turn on.\n\nNow I am getting it to randomly go to 20V and turn on and sometimes, it stays at 5V with 0.05A, floating, this time the 1.1V LDO is present.\nWhen it starts, it will load the recovery mode (I guess) but it won't reach that and then fans will go full speed and laptop will shut off.\nI am getting about 100ohms to ground on the 0V9 SSD rail compared to about 200 ohms on a working board.\nThe 1.8V and 2.5V SSD rails compares fine with my known working board.\n\nDoes that sound like a dead SSD to you?\nWhat can cause the fans to ramp up like that with then the Mac shutting down? Sensor issue or short detected?"
