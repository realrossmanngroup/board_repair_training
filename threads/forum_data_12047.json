            "message": "Hi.\n\nThis is an iMac 21-inch (slim version). \n\nCame in with the 3 RAM beep issue. Replaced RAM still beeping three times. Checked DDR PWR 1.5V and 0.75V OK.\n\nThen i replaced the CPU. Now it starts but if I make PRAM reset the 3 beeps return. If I then take out power cord for a while and put it back again it starts normally but the 3 RAM beeps return after each time I PRAM reset.\n\nI then tried putting the original CPU back in. With this CPU it cannot even start. It is beeping three times from beginning.\n\n Any clues?"

The \"working\" CPU is from an exact same model where it is known to be working.\n\nBut the problem is with the board itself because I have now also tried to put the customers \"not working\" CPU and \"not working\" RAM into another board and here it is working.\n\nThe weird thing is that with customers CPU in customers board it will not even start once but with my CPU in customers board it starts and works until i make the PRAM reset."

The history for this machine is that is has been working without any issues for several years but after the customer gave it to his son and the son started to play games almost non-stop for a week or so and then it started to beep. Hmmm... Also it is running fine here all day long without any issues until i make the PRAM reset. I am stumped!"
