This is required to power the chip. If 8.4v is NOT on pin 23, blown internal board via/trace. Fix with wire.\n2) Is <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> receiving 3.3v on pin 12? This <SIGNAL>SMC_PM_G2_EN</SIGNAL> signal tells the chip after it has turned on, that it should enable the <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> rail. If not, then perhaps <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> is bad and pulling it down, OR SMC is not creating it. Bad SMC perhaps.\n\nIf answers are both yes, then it's time to figure out why <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> is low. You have ruled out a short to ground, which means bad chip. Replace <CHIP>U7501</CHIP>."

I finally took diode measurements of all the pins on the board where the <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> goes. I figured out the 3.3 lines were shorted to ground by <TRANSISTOR>Q7560</TRANSISTOR>. I replaced that and the short went away. Replaced the <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> one more time and fan spins and passes ASD and boots, etc... \n\nThanks again for all your help and your \"teaching\" moment. The forum is an awesome resource and I hope you and Duke and all the other contributors stick around for quite a while!\n\nOn a side note, if you read this post. Do you still offer the week of training/teaching in your NYC office? I'd still be interested in that...\n\nThanks!\n\nWill Bailey"
