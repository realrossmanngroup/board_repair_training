I get .56A at my PSU but no chime, image or POST. I have all the voltages present even PPVCC_S0_CPU but I get nothing... should I reprogram the BIOS? This is so weird, it was working just fine, and after I cleaned, it just won\u00b4t start...\nI have no USB activity and it is stuck at .56 A this board usually goes up to .80 a and then down to .40-50 but it usually doesn\u00b4t stops at a constant consumption, please help!"}
