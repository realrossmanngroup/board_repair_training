I have all the voltages present even <SIGNAL>PPVCC_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> but I get nothing... should I reprogram the BIOS? This is so weird, it was working just fine, and after I cleaned, it just won´t start...\nI have no USB activity and it is stuck at .56 A this board usually goes up to .80 a and then down to .40-50 but it usually doesn´t stops at a constant consumption, please help!"
