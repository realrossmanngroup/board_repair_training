I tried Clean ME, updating, upgrading, external OS. Also,  Image is there when waking just no LCD Backlight. I replaced <CHIP>U7701</CHIP> as I wasn't sure if there was any controls tied to it to wake. I did notice while loading MOnterey on it, if I waked it from sleep the backlight would come on as it should. I don't have a KNOWN good bios, but I could try one from donor. Do you have good one?"

I was having issues getting a small SSD update which maybe is related as I found some info regarding certain OWC sSd's that require latest Monterey update but usually those will fail the firmware update if not done first. I've tried a couple of different SSD's both Samsung just to see if any related reason. It is still studck on 428.40.10.0.0. \n\nIs there another way to tie the kb backlight signal to LCD backlight trigger?"

The only reason I replaced the SMC again was that seems to be common cause for higher fans when trackpad and battery are ruled out and otherwise unknown reason for high fans."
