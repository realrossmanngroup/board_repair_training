        "message":"Hello. \n\nMac A2141 doesn't turns on. 20v 0.05A with battery, 5v 0.05A without battery.\nFound short on PP3V3_G3H_SOCPMU (C7805), after i changed cap - short is gone. \nNow PPBUS - 12.3v, \n         PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X - 3.3v\n         PP3V3_G3H_T - 0.4v\nOther voltages are missing, so no DFU as well. With R5750 removed - PP3V3_G3H_T is 0v and PP3V3_G3H_SOCPMU is 1,5v\nPP3V3_G3H_T comes from U7650, but there are no enable signals for this chip, P5V_3V3G3H_EN comes from PMU_PVDDMAIN_EN, and it comes from U7800. Changed U7800, no changes. \n         Schematic shows there are 3 LDO_IN for U7800: PP1V1_SLPS2R (missing) PP1V8_SLPS2R (missing) and only PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X is present. So as i understand U7800 is not powered and not creating voltage for T2\n          Im not sure which chip is responsible for creating SLPS2R signals, is it U7800? Looks like im stuck here...\nThanks for help in advance!"
