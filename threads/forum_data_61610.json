With <RESISTOR>R5750</RESISTOR> removed - <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_T</SIGNAL> is 0v and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_SOCPMU</SIGNAL> is 1,5v\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_T</SIGNAL> comes from <CHIP>U7650</CHIP>, but there are no enable signals for this chip, <SIGNAL>P5V_3V3G3H_EN</SIGNAL> comes from <SIGNAL>PMU_PVDDMAIN_EN</SIGNAL>, and it comes from <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>. Changed <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>, no changes. \n         Schematic shows there are 3 <SIGNAL>LDO_IN</SIGNAL> for <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>: <SIGNAL>PP1V1_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> (missing) <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SLPS2R</SIGNAL> (missing) and only <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X</SIGNAL> is present. So as i understand <CHIP>U7800</CHIP> is not powered and not creating voltage for T2\n          Im not sure which chip is responsible for creating SLPS2R signals, is it <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>? Looks like im stuck here...\nThanks for help in advance!"
