No liquid or drop damage.\n\nTried revive option in apple configurator 2 no change. Data is important.\n\nDisconnected all attached devices except screen and another test with just external but no change.\n\nAlso when trying internet recovery as soon as progress bar finishes loading it will crash right after as well just like when OS starts to load.\n\nWhat should be checked next???"
