I have 820-00165-02 boards for doners, but a 820-00164-A came by with some water damage under the SMC. Are the 11\" and 13.3\" interchangeable?\n\nThanks!"}

If I need to order more diner boards, well obviously that is going to add a few weeks time as I love in a third world country and shipping really sucks to here.\ni ordered the 13.3\" versions because Louis recommend it at one time, being they have all the same stuff the 11\" have plus some more, but the BIOS is probably different if i had to guess. Now the SMC, I'm not too sure about. That's why I am asking if anyone has experience in this.\ni am hoping Duke or Louis could chime in on this one, or someone that has tried or knows for sure.\n\nOf course I could try and see, but therevisbother water damage around it, and I don't want to go down the rabbit hole, because the SMC I replaced also doesn't work with the board... If you get what I mean."}
