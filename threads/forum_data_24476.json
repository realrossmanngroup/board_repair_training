        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "SMC_PM_G2_EN": "What is SMC_PM_G2_EN? SMC_PM_G2_EN is a signal that comes from the SMC that is a prerequsite for all of the enable signals for the S5 rails to come on, such as P3V3S5_EN. S5 rails will not come on if SMC_PM_G2_EN is not coming..",
        "SMC_ONOF": "What is SMC_ONOF? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "R7021": "What is R7021? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",
        "R7052": "What is R7052? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",
        "R7022": "What is R7022? Current sense resistor between charger current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H around 4v, quarter fan spin, or battery not charging..",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. ."
