I can use it for a day without any issue but the next one it may shutdowns 3-4 times for no particular reasons.\n\nEverything other than the mainboard itself has been replaced, everything, so it has to be the mainboard.\n\nThe board had corrosion near <CHIP>U7501</CHIP> and on <RESISTOR>R5595</RESISTOR> near the SMC.\nThe board was working though at the time the customer brought the Mac and redoing the area didn't help apparently...\n\nI read Duke answers on <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3209</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> boards to replace the capacitors on <SIGNAL>PPVRTC_G3H</SIGNAL> line connected to the PCH but same.\n\nAny hint?"
