It had little corrosion around U8020, so I removed the IC, cleaned everything and replaced the IC. Still no power. I get a little low voltage on R8020. It should be 3.42V but I get only 2.9~3V. Replaced the IC a lot of times already and same result. If I inject 3.4V on R8020 pads the board starts, but obviously this isn't a solution. Already lifted all caps on the line but same result. Any ideas on where to look?"}

Remove U8020 and inspect closely in what state are the pins on the board. It is possible that pad for enable signal is damaged and that EN voltage is not really getting to the switch. Both Vin and Vout have double pads\/pins but EN is only one pad and very sensitive. It is possible that EN signal doesn't have a real contact to the witch ball, since it is BGA chip.\nIf pad on the board is even slightly damaged, then it is possible that there is no contact between EN ball on the TPS chip and actual pad on the motherboard.\n\nThere is also one more thing you can check. When measuring voltage, place red probe on the casing of the U8020 switch and check wheter there is voltage on the case to the ground."}

Removed U8020 and enable signal is steady 3.3V on the pad, so no problem there. I tried jumping 3.3V directly to R8020 and when doing this 3.3V line goes to 3V as when with U8020 in place. Something is dragging down the line and I cannot figure out what is."}
