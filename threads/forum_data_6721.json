I do have a schematic and board view for this logic board.\n\n-Looked over the board really well for liquid damage none was found.\n-Tried a new keyboard/power button still no fan spin.\n- I do get Green light on charger\n- Tried another charger\n\nAt this point I started measuring power rails started with the main 3 Louis talks about.\n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> -  8.4v  ( I thought this was suppose to 12v, the schematic says its suppose to be 6v. im a little confused on this)\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V42_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3.44v\n\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_S3</SIGNAL> - missing 0.0v\n\nIf you can point be toward the next step that would be great."
