So im catching on. But I still have a lot to learn. I do have a schematic and board view for this logic board.\n\n-Looked over the board really well for liquid damage none was found.\n-Tried a new keyboard\/power button still no fan spin.\n- I do get Green light on charger\n- Tried another charger\n\nAt this point I started measuring power rails started with the main 3 Louis talks about.\n\nppbus_G3H -  8.4v  ( I thought this was suppose to 12v, the schematic says its suppose to be 6v. im a little confused on this)\n\npp3v42_g3h - 3.44v\n\npp5v_s3 - missing 0.0v\n\nIf you can point be toward the next step that would be great."}

Thanks Duke. \nI just watched one of the videos from Louis last night that he did this is exact same process. Very helpful stuff."}
