Replaced I/O Board and cable, as well as TP cable. Fans still high. Ran Apple Diags and Im getting SMC error and Camera error. Fans high with or without camera connected. Any direction will be appreciated. \n\nThanks"

HWMonitor showed that the issue was with CPU Sensor. SMBUS _SMC_SDA was fluctuating. Followed that line to <CHIP>U5620</CHIP>, where there was a tiny bit of corrosion that I missed. Replaced <CHIP>U5620</CHIP> and all is good. \nThanks alot guys for your help!"
