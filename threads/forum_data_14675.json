I cleaned up corrosion around ISL6259 , LCDS connector, U5400 and Q5300, Q4262 was corroded and replaced from donor board,  a few misc caps and resistors replaced due to corrosion (mostly around U5400 and Q5300).\n\nPlugged back in and got Green light and Fan Spin, That means I am done right Louis?\n\nI put the logic board back into chassis and ran ASD which failed with \"SMC IO failed\" on test Th1H.\n\nI checked PPBUS_G3H and discovered its 12.2V. Reflowed the SMC and now PPBUS_G3H is 16V???\n\nI removed F7040 so I could take some measurements around ISL6259 and MOSFETS without the 16V causing damage, but with F7040 removed PPBUS_G3H is 12.50V\n\nAny thoughts anyone?\n\nThanks"}
