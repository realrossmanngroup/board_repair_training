I cleaned up corrosion around <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> , LCDS connector, <CHIP>U5400</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q5300</TRANSISTOR>, <TRANSISTOR>Q4262</TRANSISTOR> was corroded and replaced from donor board,  a few misc caps and resistors replaced due to corrosion (mostly around <CHIP>U5400</CHIP> and <TRANSISTOR>Q5300</TRANSISTOR>).\n\nPlugged back in and got Green light and Fan Spin, That means I am done right Louis?\n\nI put the logic board back into chassis and ran ASD which failed with \"SMC IO failed\" on test Th1H.\n\nI checked <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> and discovered its 12.2V. Reflowed the SMC and now <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 16V???\n\nI removed F7040 so I could take some measurements around <CHIP>ISL6259</CHIP> and MOSFETS without the 16V causing damage, but with F7040 removed <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.50V\n\nAny thoughts anyone?\n\nThanks"
