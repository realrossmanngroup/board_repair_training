It has no trackpad or keyboard, and is also missing Bluetooth (\"no information\" in system profiler). I checked all associated resistors, and they all check out fine. This isn't a liquid-damaged board. PP3v3_s4 is present at pin 22 of J5800 and pin 30 of J5713. SMC_LID is 3.36v.\n\nU2700 measurements:\n\npin 1: 0v\n2: 0v\n3: 3.3v\n4: 0v\n5: 3.3v\n6: 0v\n7: 3.125v\n8: .55v\n9: .375v\n\nSurrounding resistors all seem to measure fine. BIOS chip looks untouched. SMC area looks good as well.\n\nAny ideas?"}

I replaced it and no change, but will try another chip just to be sure.\n\nWill update once I try another one--will be tomorrow morning, about the head out. Thanks for the help so far, duke, really appreciate your insights. Will update tomorrow!"}

If you have the chip off you can bridge the incoming USB from the PCH to the keyboard chip to see if the PCH USB port is working."}

What are the odds? Never actually had that happen before (heard about it a few times though). Whew. I was beginning to think this may be an SMC\/PCH issue. Thanks, Duke! I appreciate it.\n\nMark this one \"solved\"!"}
