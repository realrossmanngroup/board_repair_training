Fans will spin fast but nothing happens no image on screen nothing on external either.\n\nany ideas?"}

Replaced the resistor because it was giving a low value compared to known good and that got it to fan spin.\n\nboard has no PPVCORE_S0_CPU rail."}

You can heat up the GPU and see if it lives again. If it still has an original GPU with date code 11\/12 this board is a waste of time anyway as it is a ticking time bomb."}

No Vcore also sucks in general. \n4.97 vs 5.00, do you really think that will matter? Do you really think your multimeter\/probes etc. will be accurate enough to worry about 0.03V?\n\nCould be bad BIOS\/bad CPU\/bad PCH\/knocked off resistor\/anything and next month a dead GPU. Save yourself the headache and forget about this one."}
