        "PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT": "What is PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT? PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is a power rail that powers the LED light in the screen of the device that allows you to see what is on the screen. When this is low or missing, the screen will be dim..",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SD": "What is BKLT_SD? BKLT_SD is a pin of the LED driver that goes to the voltage divider that feeds the gate of the transistor that sits between PPBUS_G3H and the backlight circuit. The LED driver will short this pin to ground when backlight circuit is ready to turn on. Prerequisites are 1) it is told to turn on via enable signal, the screen has communicated with the LED driver 2) current sensing circuit is working 3) does not detect an over-current situation such as the backlight power rail being shorted to ground.",

No corrosion around J8500 or the board to board cable. I've tried a known working display, but nothing.\n\nBacklight is not coming on, and there is no image visible when viewing with a flashlight.\n\nI compared J8500 pins to those on a working board in diode mode; they're the same.\n\nI suspected <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> as its somewhat close to <CHIP>U2890</CHIP> and replaced it, but no change.\n\nStuff measured: [TABLE=\"border: 0, cellspacing: 0\"]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]<SIGNAL>BUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: left\"]3,4V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]<SIGNAL>PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: left\"]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n[TABLE=\"border: 0, cellspacing: 0\"]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]<CHIP>U8400</CHIP> input check[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: right\"] [/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]<SIGNAL>BKLT_EN_R</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: right\"]3,3V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]<SIGNAL>PP5V_S0_BKLT_A</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: right\"]5,1V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]<SIGNAL>BKLT_SD</SIGNAL>[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: right\"]12,8V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\nAs I understand it, <SIGNAL>BKLT_SD</SIGNAL> needs to be lower than 12,8V for <CHIP>U8400</CHIP> to open up.
