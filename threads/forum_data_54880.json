        "message":"This one came in with liquid damage  that was repaired by someone else. U2890 and some components around it were replaced, flux was still on there.\n\nThis board powers up fine and shows an image on external display, but not on the built-in screen. No corrosion around J8500 or the board to board cable. I've tried a known working display, but nothing.\n\nBacklight is not coming on, and there is no image visible when viewing with a flashlight.\n\nI compared J8500 pins to those on a working board in diode mode; they're the same.\n\nI suspected U8400 as its somewhat close to U2890 and replaced it, but no change.\n\nStuff measured: [TABLE=\"border: 0, cellspacing: 0\"]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]BUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: left\"]3,4V[\/TD]\n \t\t[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: left\"]0V[\/TD]\n \t\t[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]\n[TABLE=\"border: 0, cellspacing: 0\"]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]U8400 input check[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: right\"] [\/TD]\n \t\t[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]BKLT_EN_R[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: right\"]3,3V[\/TD]\n \t\t[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]PP5V_S0_BKLT_A[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: right\"]5,1V[\/TD]\n \t\t[\/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"align: left\"]BKLT_SD[\/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"align: right\"]12,8V[\/TD]\n \t\t[\/TR]\n[\/TABLE]\n\nAs I understand it, BKLT_SD needs to be lower than 12,8V for U8400 to open up.
