In the case of liquid you want to look at the data lines on R5280 and R5281. If either measurement is short, then one of the data lines between the the SMC and the battery are no bueno because either the SMC is dead or has crap under it, the ISL you replaced is bad, or one of the caps attached to those data lines on the back of the board is shorted or bad which is really rare"}

Put the red probe on ground, black probe on pin 2 of R5281, and provide measurement in diode mode. Do the same with pin 2 of R5280.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is 12.23v instead of 12.56v because the SMC is not communicating with the ISL6259 as it is supposed to. The SMC uses this same data line to communicate with the battery, so if this does not work then it will not recognize the battery either.\n\nLook at C6952 and C6953 as well and tell me what they look like."}
