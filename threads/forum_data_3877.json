        "R7051": "What is R7051? Current sense resistor between battery current sense shunt resistor and ISL6259. When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution.

SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. .",

        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",

            "message": "if i pull out F7040/41 then i get only a short time green light. then i have to wait a little to connect again for a short green light.\n\nto be shure i replaced again <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> but no change\n\nthere is still something not ok in the 3.41 or one wire circuit i think....\n\nwithout F7040/41 should be minimum 3.41V stable\n\nafter plug in magsafe green light is coming up, 3.41V is coming up as well. it stays a few seconds and then no green light, no 3.41V\n\nof course, no 3.41V no green light. could it be that the same process only quicker is going on when inserted F7040/41 ? and thats the reason for the flickering somehow ?\n\n\n1. I replaced <CHIP>U6990</CHIP>, no change\n2. I removed L6995 and injected 3.41V on Pin 2 from L6995\n\n<SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC</SIGNAL> is stable\n\nbut result is still the same. WTF can that be. Should be easy....\n\nfound still that <SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5_ISNS_R</SIGNAL> is not stable but VREG 3(over <CAPACITOR>C7203</CAPACITOR>) are stable, VREG5 not (over <CAPACITOR>C7205</CAPACITOR>) is that important or not in this state?"
