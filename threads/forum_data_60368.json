            "message": "Hi,\nI have this board that have signs of liquid spill. It won't turn on.\n<CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> stuff works fine, I get 20V on the charger, so I have good <SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is present also.\n\nBut then I get no other rails, no S5, S4 and probably nothing else either. The enable signal for those rails all come from <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>, and it's not active.\nSo I've looked at <CHIP>U7800</CHIP>. It has good power input from <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL>. The 3V LDO gives me 3.2V.\n\n<SIGNAL>PP3V1_RTC</SIGNAL> however gives me 6mV. Measuring resistance to ground on it gives me 20 Ohms.\nI don't know if this is normal or not, don't have a good working board to compare it to.\nIf this is a short to ground, then I guess this is almost hopeless. Few caps to check for short, and if not, then bad PCH ?"
