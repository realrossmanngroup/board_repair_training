Theres no visible corrosion on the board. And i managed to turn it on once but no luck again. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPVCORE_S0_CPU</SIGNAL> is 0.78v\n\n<CHIP>U7400</CHIP> shows no sign of damage at all, and  <SIGNAL>CPUIMVP_VR_ON</SIGNAL> is 3.3v and <SIGNAL>PP5V_S0</SIGNAL> lines are 5v. \n\nWhat should i do next?. Could it be a bad CPU?"

I cant disable it anymore because i cant even boot in safe mode. The LCD shows no image at all. Shouldnt a macbook 2011 still at least try to boot with a bad GPU?\n\nThank you."
