        "message":"Hello, hope you guys are all right.\n\nSo i have an 820-2915-B with charger light, fan spin, but no chime and no video (no mouse light). Theres no visible corrosion on the board. And i managed to turn it on once but no luck again. \n\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU is 0.78v\n\nU7400 shows no sign of damage at all, and  CPUIMVP_VR_ON is 3.3v and PP5V_S0 lines are 5v. \n\nWhat should i do next?. Could it be a bad CPU?"

I cant disable it anymore because i cant even boot in safe mode. The LCD shows no image at all. Shouldnt a macbook 2011 still at least try to boot with a bad GPU?\n\nThank you."
