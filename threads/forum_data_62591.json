        "message":"Hi again.\nI have an 820-00928-A that does not detect the internal SSD.\nThis unit was apparently water damaged.\nAnother technician cleaned the board, unfortunately, so I cannot see where the liquid got onto the board.\nThere are no signs of corrosion anywhere.\n\nBooting from a Monterey boot disk, disk utility fails to see the SSD.\n\nI have cleaned and re-seated the metal plate on J9600, which appears absolutely clean.\nSSD_PGOOD_L is 1.76v\nI have tested all SSD voltages on page 84, all are exactly as they should be.\n\nEdit. I tried heating the SSD NANDs and controller, as per recommendations on another post here, without any change.\n\nAny other suggestions greatly appreciated."
