One capacitor was very corroded, after removing it the short circuit was gone. I would like to replace that capacitor, but I don't know its parameters. Are schematics for i/o boards available anywhere?"

Though, there is a group of components that looks identical, even though it is placed on the other side of the board . The capacitor that is missing on my board would correspond to <CAPACITOR>C9800</CAPACITOR>. But I guess there is no guarantee that it has the same parameters as the cap on the 2015 board, right?\nAs these i/o boards are very cheap, I guess it makes more sense to buy one and keep this one as a donor."
