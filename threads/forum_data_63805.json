There is no liquid or physical damage, no corrosion, no other repair attempts. Board switches to 20V but gets stuck at 0,04A. The <SIGNAL>PP1V8_SUS</SIGNAL> and <SIGNAL>PP3V3_SUS</SIGNAL> are missing, no shorts. Also <SIGNAL>PM_SLP_SUS_L</SIGNAL> is low with 0,003V. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> - 12,57V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_G3H</SIGNAL> - 3,41V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_S5</SIGNAL> - 3,30V\n\n<CHIP>U7800</CHIP> and the area around looks really good, but I have replaced it just on case with no result. \n\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_PMIC</SIGNAL> - 12,57V\n<SIGNAL>PP3V3_PMICLDO</SIGNAL> - 3,29V\n<SIGNAL>PP5V_PMICLDO</SIGNAL> - 5,00V\n\nOn thermal camera I can see, that PCH get slightly warmer in two areas amd my guess is PCH is dead. Maybe you have other suggestions?"
