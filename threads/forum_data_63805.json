        "message":"I'm working on 820-00281 board which is not turning on. Customer states, that it just died with no reason. There is no liquid or physical damage, no corrosion, no other repair attempts. Board switches to 20V but gets stuck at 0,04A. The PP1V8_SUS and PP3V3_SUS are missing, no shorts. Also PM_SLP_SUS_L is low with 0,003V. \n\nPPBUS_G3H - 12,57V\nPP3V3_G3H - 3,41V\nPP3V3_S5 - 3,30V\n\nU7800 and the area around looks really good, but I have replaced it just on case with no result. \n\nPPBUS_PMIC - 12,57V\nPP3V3_PMICLDO - 3,29V\nPP5V_PMICLDO - 5,00V\n\nOn thermal camera I can see, that PCH get slightly warmer in two areas amd my guess is PCH is dead. Maybe you have other suggestions?"

Board starts, CPU VCORE is present, all S0 voltages too but there is no video, no chime, just clicking trackpad. Board takes ~1A from charger. I have already tried new bios found on this forum, but it hasn't changed anything. Could you please share known 100% working bios with clean ME?"
