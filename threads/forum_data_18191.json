Still failing. Could it be some other issue on both of these boards or more likely a bad lot of chips?\nI've attached a picture of the screen after replacing the GPU."

Yes, they are rampant scammers...[\/QUOTE]\n\n\n\nYep and this is how they respond....\n\n[B]Message from L2[\/B]\n-----------------------\n\"Dear customer, After checking with our technician and shipping department about this chip-set, We had the suggestions and conclusions below:\n1. Please provide us how to prove this chip-set is defective without using it.\n2. If you had used it, we can not accept return.\n3. After checking with our shipping department and our stock, all our chip-sets are brand new. Which means, it is impossible thermal paste on it.\n4. Technical Suggest: Control the temperature, all the chip-set are good.\nTo be honest, we own repair store, we use this chip set to repair our customer logic board. All the chip-set are good, 0% defective rate right now. For the model A1286 2011 Apple laptop, there is a logic board design flaw, the technician need to set the repairing temperature very careful for repair. Or, it will be failure.\n5. Technical Suggestion: Damaged by the wrong operation. The opposite of this chip-set part of logic board, it is video ram. It may be damaged by when you repair the video issues.\n\nSo, our technician said if you can control the repair temperature very careful, it will be no problem for this repair. and the chip-set is good. Thanks\"\n---------------------\n\n[B]Reply[\/B]\n\n--------------------\nThey are bad chips and this is eCommerce and fortunately for me it does not matter a if I tested them, used them, or put them up my ass to see the taste comes out on my tongue.\n\nThey are not as described and you have no choice but to give me back my money.\n\nIf you do not know how to tell good chips from bad you should not be selling them... But you know, the thermal paste on some of these chips while untouched in the reel... Yeah... That kind of negated the need to view the balls under the microscope or even to open the reel.\n\nI really do admire your last message, it show that you are willing to put all of your brain power into trying to rip people off. Good for you little man!\n\nAll the best.\nMike\n-------------------\n\nWhat a bunch of C**t's\nStay away from L2"

If you look into NOT CHINA you will find good chips.\nJust because the places you have bought from so far are selling fake chips it does not mean there are no good ones anywhere.... You think Duke found a 360 spool of chips by just giving up and not looking? You think I got good chips by just giving up when Duke advised me to?\n\nIn short, there are good chips around. You just have to find them. If you keep sending your money in the same direction don't expect a different outcome."

        "message":"Anyone in this thread able to fix an 820-2915 video chip issue board for me? I don't ever mess with these boards, and normally just unload them when I get them but I have a customer that really wants to get his fixed. I'm in the US. Ideally I would like to have this done by someone who's been doing a lot of these successfully. I'm extremely hesitant to get in the middle of this and even touch this computer but he's a customer I have to take care of. Thanks. -Jay"
