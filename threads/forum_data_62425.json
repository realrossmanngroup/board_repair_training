Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

Removed <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR> to find that pad were burnt, but even with <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR> removed there still was short. Later tried removing these components to solve short problem: <TRANSISTOR>Q7065</TRANSISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7050</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7051</CAPACITOR>, <CHIP>U7000</CHIP>, <CAPACITOR>C7053</CAPACITOR>, <RESISTOR>R7060</RESISTOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7069</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7064</CAPACITOR>, <CAPACITOR>C7066</CAPACITOR>, but not luck finding short. Anything i'm missing or pads on <TRANSISTOR>Q7040</TRANSISTOR> busted? Thank you in advice for help üôè"
