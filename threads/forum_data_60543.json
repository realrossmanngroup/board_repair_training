        "820-01598": "What is 820-01598? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U8400": "What is U8400? a CHIP.",
        "PP5V_G3S": "What is PP5V_G3S? PP5V_G3S is a 5v power rail present when the system is in a G3S standby state.",
        "BKLT_EN_R": "What is BKLT_EN_R? This signal enables backlight. Anytime you see a signal ending with “_EN” , that means this signal being present/high enables what it is referring to. This signal says “BKL” before “_EN”. “BKL” sounds short for “BACKLIGHT”, so it is safe to assume this signal enables backlight when present. The “_R” suffix means that the signal is asserted when it is high, as in 3.3v, which is the opposite of the “_L”  suffix.",
        "BKLT_SCL": "What is BKLT_SCL? BKLT_SCL is an I2C signal clock line between the LED driver that creates the LCD backlight power rail that powers the backlight in the screen and the screen. The screen needs to speak to the LED driver on this line before backlight voltage will be created..",
        "PP5V_S0_BKLT_D": "What is PP5V_S0_BKLT_D? a SIGNAL.",
        "LCDBKLT_FB": "What is LCDBKLT_FB? LCDBKLT_FB is a feedback line between backlight output and the feedback pin on the LED driver. When this connection is broken, backlight output will be equal to PPBUS_G3H voltage of the system rather than boosting. Since this point is the highest voltage in the system, it is the fastest to corrode when liquid damaged, so it is a very common point to check when there is no backlight. .",
