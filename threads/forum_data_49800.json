    "definitions": {
        "820-00840": "What is 820-00840? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR": "What is PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR? This is the input that comes from the charger..",
        "PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H": "What is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H? This is the input from the USB-C charger or the battery that is the input voltage for the chip responsible for creating PP3V3_G3H. It can be missing when capacitors on this line are shorted to ground, or when the diode in front of it leading to the chip that creates PP3V3_G3H is blown. .",
        "PPVCCCPU_S0G": "What is PPVCCCPU_S0G? a SIGNAL.",
        "PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG": "What is PPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG? This is battery power that flows to the system AFTER it has gone through a current sense resistor, before it goes through a fuse to become PPBUS_G3H power rail. .",
        "SMC_RESET_R_L": "What is SMC_RESET_R_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "DCINVSENS_EN_L": "What is DCINVSENS_EN_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "SMC_CHGR_INT_L": "What is SMC_CHGR_INT_L? a SIGNAL.",
        "PD_SMC_CBC_ON": "What is PD_SMC_CBC_ON? a SIGNAL.",
        "C8400": "What is C8400? a CAPACITOR.",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "3V3_G3H": "What is 3V3_G3H? This is one of the first power rails that must turn on for Macbooks that use USB-C for charging. This power rail powers the CD3215 chip that controls the USB-C charger, speaks to the USB-C charger, and requests 20 volts up from the default 5 volts that the USB-C charger puts out when initially connected to an unknown device. .",
        "5V_S5": "What is 5V_S5? 5V_S5 is an abbreviation for “PP5V_S5” which is a 5v power rail that is present when the machine is in an S5 state. .",
        "XV_SUS": "What is XV_SUS? a SIGNAL.",
        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. ."
