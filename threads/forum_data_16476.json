        "message":"I am fixing my first macbook, and I found a few lines that have no power, but I do not really know what to do from there, I'm having trouble reading the schematics properly so I dont know where to backtrack to in order to hunt down the problem that is keeping these certain rails from getting power. the board does not get warm anywhere so I dont know of a short. One diode was burnt in half, but i replaced it already, and its not even on the the lines without voltage.  anyway, some one on one phone tutoring would be appreciated and if anyone can help (who knows what theyre doing) i am willing to pay $75 hr for phone tutoring."

[\/QUOTE]\n\nThe first problem is you said you can't tell where a signal is coming from, but you haven't told me a signal so I can show you where it is coming from. \n\nThe second problem is assuming there is a short circuit keeping the machine from turning on.A short circuit means voltage is going to ground when it isn't supposed to because a component on a line has failed in a manner that sends all power to ground. What if I remove a component in a line? What if a signal telling something to turn on is not present? \n\nto begin identifying the problem, go to the page in the schematic where the power rails are listed and measure them. G3H ones should always be present, S5 ones should always be present. After that, then S4, then S3, then S0. Start with the G3H rails and the S5 rails - are there any not present?"
