            "message": "Hi, this is my first board repair ever. This is my personal learning project to learn microsoldering and troubleshooting boards. I don't get paid for it. I'm trying my best not to be stupid.\n\nHaving a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00840</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>-A with liquid damage. Don't now the exact story behind this MacBook. The battery has corrosion on its board and was disconnected with kapton tape from the logicboard. Seems that someone worked on it already (maybe it was a Genius).\n\nThe board has some corrosion on the F4800 area and as well on <TRANSISTOR>Q7065</TRANSISTOR> and also next to <TRANSISTOR>Q8030</TRANSISTOR>. I think that most of the board had contact with water, because I can clearly see some calcification all over the board which may come from dried water (I highlighted this in one of my uploads). I can scrape the white stuff from the contacts or clean it with PCB cleaner. Never seen something like that on Louis videos before.\n\nNot so good looking caps are <CAPACITOR>C7650</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7470</CAPACITOR> but the corresponding rails are not shorted.\n\n* <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is there with 13.1V\n* <SIGNAL>P5VS4_VSW</SIGNAL> is 0V\n* <SIGNAL>PP5V_S5</SIGNAL> is 0.15V\n* There is a short to ground on <SIGNAL>P3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. I get 0.5 Ohm resistance to ground on that rail.\n\nMy first question: what should I do next?\n\nI started the investigation on <SIGNAL>P3V3_S5</SIGNAL>. I have learned from Louis Videos that I can inject voltage to a rail to find out what is shorted. When I set my Power Supply to 1V and limit the current to 2A it only uses 0.4V. Nothing gets warm. Should I increase the current? I don't want to roast anything there. Or should I check a different rail?"

But I'm trying my luck and I think that I'm still learning something with this project :)\n\nI've increased the current to 3.2A (0.5V). Unfortunately, I do not have a thermal camera and only feel a very slow increase in heat in the area right next to the CPU. It could be also on the other side of the board underneath the CPU, but I'm not sure. I tried the alcohol trick, but as I said, it's not really something really hot (except my bench power supply). \n\nIf the CPU has a short to ground, will the entire CPU become hot, or only a part of it?"
