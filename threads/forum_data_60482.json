I replaced this chip along with <CAPACITOR>C7622</CAPACITOR> and <CAPACITOR>C7624</CAPACITOR>. There is now a 70ma being drawn and no power.\n\nGreen light on charger/turns to orange. I have verified this will charge a battery. I went through every single power rail and all tested good. What might be causing this 70ma draw?\n\nS5/S4/S3/S0 all good both 3.3V and 5V\n<SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 8.59V\n<SIGNAL>PP342_G3H</SIGNAL> is 3.42V\nPPDCIN-G3H is 18.5V\n\nThanks is advance"
