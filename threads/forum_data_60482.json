I replaced this chip along with C7622 and C7624. There is now a 70ma being drawn and no power.\n\nGreen light on charger\/turns to orange. I have verified this will charge a battery. I went through every single power rail and all tested good. What might be causing this 70ma draw?\n\nS5\/S4\/S3\/S0 all good both 3.3V and 5V\nPPBUS_G3H is 8.59V\nPP342_G3h is 3.42V\nPPDCIN-G3H is 18.5V\n\nThanks is advance"}
