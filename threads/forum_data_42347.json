You were right! Thank you very much! There was a pinhole in TP between pin 27 and pin 2 of C7120. Sorry for the wild goose chase man, I honestly couldn't see it and my joints on the isl looked strong, so I assumed I had good connectivity. Didn't mean to waste your time, because I do appreciate it.  So, I do have ppbuss back but still not turning on. I don't trust this battery so I ordered a couple new ones. Will post back, have a good one."}
