            "message": "I have four of these machines gathering dust in the workshop. Now that I have cleared all the 2011 machines, its these suckers turn to find new homes.\n\nThere's just one problem, they all have fucked GPUs.\n\nThese all carry a chip I have never replaced before. the ATI 216-0769010.\n\nSo I ordered one \"new\" one from SEEIC, the BGA work went well. However now the imac, turns on, and just sits in a chime cycle. Bong, bong, bong. It would be funny if the chip wasn't +Â£30.00.\n\nSo the real question is, are there any new chips out there, or are they generally remarked junk. Anyone successfully change one recently, if so where did you get it ?\n\nthanks"
