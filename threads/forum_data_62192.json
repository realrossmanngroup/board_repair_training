Laptop worked but it would shutdown sometimes and data did not work on ports according to client.\n\n<CHIP>U3200</CHIP> pads 80 and 81 were burnt bad (<SIGNAL>USBC_XB_USB_TOP_P</SIGNAL> - <SIGNAL>USBC_XB_USB_BOT_P</SIGNAL>), one of them had to be bridged up since it was gone, after fixing that <CHIP>U3200</CHIP> was replaced and those voltages came back, but now one of the ports (not the one were the work was done) data doesnt work but only one side, if I turn the USB device data works fine and on the other port data works fine. Charging works on all 4 sides of the ports.\n\nAlready replaced the 2 <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP> and <CHIP>U2800</CHIP> but same thing as far as data on the lower port <CHIP>U3100</CHIP>\n\nWhen the port fails <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS_F</SIGNAL> is 1.2V (the other port I am using to power the board) if I turn the USB device around <SIGNAL>PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS_F</SIGNAL> is correct at 5V"
