        "R7020": "What is R7020? Current sense shunt resistor for the charger, the resistors between this and the ISL6259 should be proper rating or else machine will turn off the charger. Measuring pins 27/28 on ISL6259 should give you 20.02 ohms. .",
        "R7005": "What is R7005? resistor between charger and CHGR_DCIN pin of ISL6259, if CHGR_DCIN is low then this resistor is probably blown. When PPBUS_G3H is low or missing this is something to check if your model has CHGR_DCIN along R7005. .",

        "Q7010": "What is Q7010? Q7010 controls whether or not PPDCIN_G3H will be let through to the PP3V42_G3H power supply, often this circuit area is not working because D7010 has died or corroded. .",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

When these resistors fail the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being drawn from the charger, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing power from the charger as a safety precaution.

PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H is the input voltage to the PP3V42_G3H buck converter circuit, it can be either charger voltage or battery voltage depending on what the system power source is. This often shorts to ground when one of the input capacitors dies. ."

            "message": "Hey guys, I'm working on a customer unit (<LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00163</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>) with issue reported as \"no power, no light\". I quickly realized <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> (by 3787 schematics reference) were both toast. As I'm having to sort of work blind on this one and with limited parts boards for this model, I wanted to post a few quick questions to help myself out a bit:\n\n1. Since <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> were both blown, I'll assume <TRANSISTOR>Q7010</TRANSISTOR> is fucked and will be replacing it. Would it be wise for me to replace <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> as well, to be safe? Or can I suspect that <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> did their respective jobs and <CHIP>U7090</CHIP> is probably OK? I know Diodes are pretty robust, but what about <DIODE>D7005</DIODE>? With limited parts boards, I want to make sure I replace all damaged components first-go, but without schematics it's a bit tougher (no schematics = no part numbers to compare against other boards, so can't pull from different model boards easily).\n2. Based on <RESISTOR>R7005</RESISTOR>/<RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> being blown (with zero liquid indication anywhere on the board), can I assume anything about the customer's use of a faulty/generic charger? If so, I'd like to mention to them that as a possible cause (and so they won't use the same one again with a newly-repaired board, of course).\n3. Is the <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-00138</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> or 00163 schematic out yet? Just curious. Sort of tedious working without them, but that's the nature of the business I imagine.\n\nThanks again in advance; always get great help here."

I checked the other resistors mentioned (7121/7122, 7151/52)  and they're all still measuring fine. When I plugged the charger in, <RESISTOR>R7020</RESISTOR> blew immediately. When I removed it and checked diode readings on both pads and I get OL on pin 2 and 2.04 on pin 1. Would this mean <TRANSISTOR>Q7010</TRANSISTOR> is killing the resistor? Working blind on this thing sucks, so I appreciate the help. Thanks!"

I swear the secret to figuring something out is to post about it so your brain re-thinks it to type, then you can't help but to think about another variable.\n\nAnyway, I found that <SIGNAL>PPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H</SIGNAL> was shorted. Without proper schematics, I had to just look around and think. Checked all surrounding caps and <CHIP>U7090</CHIP>, but nothing looked shorted and short remained when I pulled everything there. Decided to flip the board over and see if any caps on opposite side (in same area, through-board) looked nasty. Sure enough, found 2 caps and one was brown and obviously broken-down/shorted. Pulled it, short gone, replaced and I get green light without smoke now. :)\n\nThanks, Duke! I'll confirm once board passes all diagnostics, etc."
