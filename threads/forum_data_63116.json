            "message": "System reportedly just quit on the user one day and wouldn't turn back on.  No signs of liquid exposure.\n\nThis board has been picked up and put down over the course of a few weeks now.  At this point I honestly am not sure what I did to it - there was <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> reflowing and touchups, etc involved. - but the last thing that I did was remove and reball the top (XB / master) <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>.  Before that the system was sitting at 5v / 0.24A from all ports.  This last reball was in response to the top port only receiving any power in one orientation, which was an issue I later realized may have only been due to a faulty \"new\" USB-C portset.  :|  \n\nAmateur hour over here like woah.  \n\nAnyway, right now where I'm at is that the system will power and boot all the way into the OS from the top port, but the bottom port is cycling.\n\nNothing else looks out of place, so... just replace the bottom <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> now too or is there some TBT ROM stuff I should be looking into?\n\nAlso what lines of communication are used for the slave <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP> to talk to the TBT ROM through the master <CHIP>CD3215</CHIP>?  I'd love to know.\n\nThank you!"
