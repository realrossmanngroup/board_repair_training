            "message": "thanks. thats a posibility. on the \"bad\" SSD is installed Mojave\n\nI cleaned the SSD and installed High Sierra, not working. Then i looked with the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER> but the intallation process has format the SSd again with APFS before installing High Sierra\n\nOk, so I cleaned again and cloned my working Disk (High sierra without APFS) on the \"bad\" disk. Now that is working in the <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1425</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>\n\nSo is there any posibility to change the BIOS for support APFS? I am now shure the client was trying to install or to update the system. In the beginning holding Alt while starting (\"bad\" SSD in <MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>A1398</MACBOOK MODEL NUMBER>) there was a bootable disk named installer to see."
