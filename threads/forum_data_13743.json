This one had no backlight issue (no bklt boosting because no PWM signal) because of <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> partially shorted to ground on SMC (only 1.24V).\n\nReplaced the SMC and now it works but <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is 9V!\n\nTried a reflow and made sure the smc \"dance trick\" but nothing change, still 9V, i am confident with soldering.\n\nBacklight now works because hell <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> is high now... did'nt tried yet if <SIGNAL>SMC_LID</SIGNAL> come back low when lid is closed...\n\nSMC seems alive, charging battery with orange light and ASD EFI report no errors.\nI must admit this particular SMC came from china...\n\nHave you had something similar? Any thoughts before i replace smc from a donour board.\n\nThanks"
