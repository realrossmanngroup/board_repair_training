        "message":"Water damaged near SMC. This one had no backlight issue (no bklt boosting because no PWM signal) because of SMC_LID partially shorted to ground on SMC (only 1.24V).\n\nReplaced the SMC and now it works but SMC_LID is 9V!\n\nTried a reflow and made sure the smc \"dance trick\" but nothing change, still 9V, i am confident with soldering.\n\nBacklight now works because hell SMC_LID is high now... did'nt tried yet if smc_lid come back low when lid is closed...\n\nSMC seems alive, charging battery with orange light and ASD EFI report no errors.\nI must admit this particular SMC came from china...\n\nHave you had something similar? Any thoughts before i replace smc from a donour board.\n\nThanks"

Seems to work normally but for how long :(\n\nUnfortunately I don't see any tracks at Q5701, R6961 and R5071 smc_lid goes right away through the board. It would be easy to recreate the circuit but the problem are the traces not accessible.\nI thought maybe using pin 112 on smc and isolate USB_DEBUGPRT_EN_L it is adjacent to pin 111 but don't think worth the try."
