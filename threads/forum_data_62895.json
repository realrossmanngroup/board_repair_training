            "message": "Hello,\n\nI have a MacBook Air that does not want to turn on. Plugging in a known good charger shows a blank amp meter screen when typically we see 5v or 20v. I replaced the type C charging ports and replaced the <CHIP>CD3217</CHIP>'s to quickly rule them out. I have a schematic, but I don't have a board view.\n\nThe fuse and the 3 caps near each type C chips have no voltage and from previous boards I've worked on these are supposed to be the 20V vbus and the 3.3v RTC and LDO for the two type C chips. The power seems to be missing very early on in the power sequence. Any advice and anyone with a link to a board view?"
