If replacing a keyboard doesnâ€™t fix an issue with keys not typing, check all traces between keyboard connector and this IC. This chip has programming so it must be replaced from a similar, ideally identical board. .",

After doing measurements i found a short to ground on pin 52 (<SIGNAL>PICKB_L</SIGNAL>) of <CHIP>U5701</CHIP>. \n\nI removed <CHIP>U5701</CHIP>, measured the trace, and it had no short to ground.\n\nAfter booting trackpad click was working again.\n\nAfter booting a second time now both the trackpad and the keyboard are no longer recognized.\n\nI'm assuming something fried the chip, but i have no idea what. \n\nSince i currently only have one more spare <CHIP>U5701</CHIP> i'm a bit wary of sticking that one on without further testing, but i have no idea what could have caused the malfunction."
