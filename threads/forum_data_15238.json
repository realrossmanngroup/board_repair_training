After doing measurements i found a short to ground on pin 52 (PICKB_L) of U5701. \n\nI removed U5701, measured the trace, and it had no short to ground.\n\nAfter booting trackpad click was working again.\n\nAfter booting a second time now both the trackpad and the keyboard are no longer recognized.\n\nI'm assuming something fried the chip, but i have no idea what. \n\nSince i currently only have one more spare u5701 i'm a bit wary of sticking that one on without further testing, but i have no idea what could have caused the malfunction."}

I also think the chip died, but i want to make certain the new one i'm going to put on does not die because i missed something else killing the chip."}
