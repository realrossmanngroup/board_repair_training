I'm excited to be a part of it, and hopefully become a better repairer as well :) \n\nThanks for your prompt reply as well. \n\nTo be clear, I've just timed it, I get fan spin for 10 seconds, and during this time is what I'm talking about when I say during boot, and then after. \n\nIn saying that I've just checked again, and SMC_PM_G2_EN is 3.4v during fan spin (10 seconds) then stay on after - I must have measured incorrectly \nPM_SLP_S4_L = 2.7v during boot then missing after the fan spin (10 seconds) \n\nYou're correct about my measurement on PP3V3_S4 - didn't realise my multi meter was changing mode on it's own :\/ how embarrassing LOL  \n\nPP3V3_S4 is 3.3v during fan spin, then 340.00mV after.\n\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.3v \nP3V3SUS_EN = 3.3v\nPM_BATLOW_L = 3.3v\nSMC_RESET_L = 3.3v (odd when I measured this just now it caused fan spin for the 10 seconds again) \nPM_DSW_PWRGD = 1v\nS5_PWRGD = 3.3v\n3V42_G3H = 3.4v \nPPBUS_G3H = 8.6v\n\nWith the RTC (real time clock) do you mean U1900 SLG3NB148CV. \n\nThanks again for your time, I clearly have a lot to learn. \n\nMax"}
