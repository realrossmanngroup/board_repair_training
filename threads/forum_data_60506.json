        "A1466": "What is A1466? A1466 is a model number for a 13 inch size MacBook Air from years Early 2015, 2017, Mid 2012, Mid 2013, Early 2014 with EMC 2925, that may contain one of these boards depending on the year & configuration: 820-00165, 820-3209, 820-3437..",

        "R1950": "What is R1950? a RESISTOR.",
        "C1950": "What is C1950? Capacitor between PP3V42_G3H & ground on pin 8 of U1950 on 2013-2015 Macbook Pros & Airs that often corrodes. When corroded, pin 8 on U1950 will be damaged, which will prevent machine from booting and cause PM_SLP_S4_L to pulse. .",

This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",

Is this approach the best approach?"

I don't have continuity between <RESISTOR>R8131</RESISTOR> and that trace under pad8. \nI tried to screech the trace before the cap, but i don't see that trace, and stopped before damage something, and waited for your reply.\n\nRegarding the <RESISTOR>R1950</RESISTOR>, both pads have exploded as shown in the picture. I cant replace the resistance, without first reconstruct the pads (i think) because i don't have where to solder the resistance? Am i wrong? If not, where is the best place to pull those signals?"
