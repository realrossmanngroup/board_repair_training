Often when the resistance across this capacitor is higher it is because one of the current sense resistors going to the ISL6259 chip has failed. When current sensing resistors between the shunt resistor and the ISL6259 power IC have failed the ISL6259 cannot gauge how much current is being sent to or drawn from the battery, which will cause the ISL6259 to stop drawing/sending power to the battery as a safety precaution. Symptoms are low voltage on PPBUS_G3H, quarter fan spin, boot looping, or battery not charging..",

When I do try to move my finger around on the trackpad the cursor does not move but I'm not sure if that is because the trackpad is not assembled into the machine.\n\nI also plugged in another keyboard and I still cannot turn the machine off with the power button or use the option key to boot.\n\nI checked voltages on the keyboard connector (J4813)\nPins 1/2/3 - 0v\nPin 4 - 3.42v\nPin 5 - 0v\nPin 6 - saw 1.3v and it goes down.\n\nOn the other side of the board I checked for continuity from Pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R4810</RESISTOR> to Probe #816 and there was no beep.\nThere is continuity though from Pin 5 of J4813 to the via above it. \n\nUpdate: I ran a wire from Pin 2 of <RESISTOR>R4810</RESISTOR> to Probe #816 and now the power button works to turn off the machine.\nI'm still not able to boot my usb stick with the option key pressed even though I see Pin 2 of J4813 jump to 3.4v when I press the left option key."
