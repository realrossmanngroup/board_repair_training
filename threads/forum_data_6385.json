            "message": "So I have a <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-3476</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board I bought off of eBay with no backlight and its been kinda throwing me for a loop for a little while now. The backlight circuit looks slightly different than previous models with the 1st transistor (at the bottom of the first voltage divider) being integrated with the <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>? At least thats what it looks like... Anyways, the area looked pretty messed up so I went ahead and replaced <CHIP>U7700</CHIP>, both <RESISTOR>R7731</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7732</RESISTOR> on the feedback trace, and the <DIODE>D7710</DIODE> diode (all visually looked like crap). Still no backlight. I do have 3.3v on the enable pin of <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> however <TRANSISTOR>Q7700</TRANSISTOR> isn't opening because there is 12.56v on pin 4, and also 12.46v on pin 3 (too much) which is why I'm assuming the backlight isn't kicking on. I've confirmed the resistance on both resistors for the first voltage divider and they're giving proper readings.. what am I overlooking?? I'm leaning towards my doner board had a bad <CHIP>U7700</CHIP> chip that I grabbed.. Ideas?"

Don't have another doner of this model board but I can probably find another resistor if needed.. Or would the chip be shorting it to ground?"
