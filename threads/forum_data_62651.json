        "message":"I\u2019m working on a 820-01700 that was liquid damaged. The LCD assembly was fine looking, but the connectors were completely corroded and burnt away. The connector on the logic board looks perfect. I installed a new flex cable between the new display assembly (tested and working by the way) and still had no image. I was able to get an image on an external display, but at login screen it just appears to hang after entering the password and it starts to load. I know it\u2019s actually running though as I was able to hear interface items as I was clicking around. I came up with the idea of using voice navigation to screen share and I was able to open the screen share on my iMac. What I see is a lower res. 4:3 image and it\u2019s useable to navigate, but this was no solution. What could be causing this issue?"
