        "PPVCORE_GPU": "What is PPVCORE_GPU? This is the main power rail for the GPU. This is required for the GPU to turn on so you can get image on the display. .",
        "PPVCORE_CPU": "What is PPVCORE_CPU? PPVCORE_CPU is an abbreviation of PPVCORE_S0_CPU. When you see someone type PPVCORE_CPU, assume they meant to type PPVCORE_S0_CPU..",
        "U6900": "What is U6900? a CHIP.",
        "PP3V3_S5": "What is PP3V3_S5? PP3V3_S5 is a 3.3v power rail when the system is in an S5 soft off power state.",
        "PP3V3_S0": "What is PP3V3_S0? The \"PP3V3_S0\" rail in a MacBook logic board is a power rail that supplies 3.3 volts to the system when it is fully awake (S0 state). .",

If this resistor is blown, the machine will turn on but not have any image, chime, or POST, because CPU vcore will be missing. This resistor is often the first to corrode because it is along a high voltage rail and it is right on the edge of the board, check this on 2011-2012 model Macbook Pros that turn on and do not chime. .",
        "U8900": "What is U8900? This chip creates the GPU power rails on the 820-3332 board to the 2012 and early 2013 15” Retina Macbook Pros. It becomes desoldered and is the cause of no video and kernel panics/crashes in that model most of the time..",
