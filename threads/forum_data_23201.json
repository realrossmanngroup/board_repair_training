        "820-2936": "What is 820-2936? a LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER.",
        "U7000": "What is U7000? U7000 refers to the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging IC on Macbooks from 2008-2012.",
        "U5110": "What is U5110? This chip is responsible for SMC_RESET_L in many Macbook models..",
        "PPBUS_G3H": "What is PPBUS_G3H? Main system power rail that charges the battery, or is power from the battery, that everything else is powered from. .",
        "SMC_RESET_L": "What is SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L puts the SMC into reset mode when it is low, _L means the signal is present when voltage is low. The SMC being in reset mode keeps it from running..",
        "SMC_BC_ACOK": "What is SMC_BC_ACOK? This is identical to CHGR_ACOK. This will come out of the ISL6258 or ISL6259 charging chip when CHGR_ACIN & CHGR_DCIN are present, and is necessary for the onewire circuit to begin working. On most Macbooks, CHGR_ACOK needs to be present in order for PP3V42_G3H to flow to the onewire circuit so that the circuitry that allows the charger to communicate with the SMC will turn on.  .",
        "3V42_G3H": "What is 3V42_G3H? This is shorthand for PP3V42_G3H which is one of the first power rails that must turn on in older Macbooks that use a magsafe charger in order for them to get a light on the charger. This power rail powers the onewire circuit and the SMC, which are necessary for the machine to communicate with the charger and get it to turn on, as well as begin the bootup sequence. .",
        "R4999": "What is R4999? a RESISTOR.",
        "SMC_RESET": "What is SMC_RESET? SMC_RESET is not a signal, it is an abbreviation for “SMC_RESET_L”, which is the signal someone is referring to when they type “SMC_RESET”  \"SMC_RESET_L is a signal that resets the SMC when it is low(this is what the “_L” prefix means), and lets the SMC out of reset mode when it is high. ."

            "message": "Got an <LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER>820-2936</LOGIC BOARD PART NUMBER> board in that had no green light and <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> measured out at 12.26v--\"great--the SMC\". I checked <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> and it's high, so I pulled the SMC. No liquid or corrosion or anything, so I figured it just died. Replaced the SMC and same behavior--no green light, <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> is 12.26v and no shorts detected. I checked <SIGNAL>SMC_RESET_L</SIGNAL> again to be sure, and it's still present/steady, so I replaced <CHIP>U5110</CHIP> to be safe. Still same behavior. I replaced <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> because I've seen some odd behavior related to it failing before as well, but no dice--same behavior. Thinking maybe I grabbed a bad SMC, I swapped it a 2nd time. Same issue. Out of frustration, I replaced the SMC a third time (totally different chip pulled from parts boards both times I replaced it), and still the same behavior. I can't figure out what would be pulling <SIGNAL>PPBUS_G3H</SIGNAL> down (no short) and preventing green light. \n\nAny ideas? I thought for sure this was a bad SMC, but after replacing it 3 times and it not resolving the issue, there's clearly something else going on here. <SIGNAL>SMC_BC_ACOK</SIGNAL> at <CHIP>U7000</CHIP> is 3.3v. No short on <SIGNAL>3V42_G3H</SIGNAL>, and it's present/steady at 3.43v. This board had no liquid.\n\nAll help/direction appreciated!"
