I am a rookie.\nI get green and orange light on charger, boots, chimes, no back light at all.\nComputer will not power on by charger alone it must have battery to power on.\nInspected back light circuit to discover R9703 missing completely. Replaced and still no back light. Do not have backlight en.\nAppears as if it may have been cleaned previously so very minor evidence of corrosion anywhere\nAny thoughts?"}

How does LCD connector look? LCD cable corroded on last 3 pins? Got voltage on L9701?"}

Lcd connector looks great, no corrosion. plugged in a known good screen and it came on. What could keep the old screen from working if the cable isn't damaged?\nStill can not figure out why it will not boot off of the charger alone"}

The no AC issue is probably around the ISL6259. Check the sense resistor circuits."}
