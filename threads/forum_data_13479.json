I've removed <RESISTOR>R7310</RESISTOR> and <RESISTOR>R7310</RESISTOR> to eliminate some variables. Nothing heats up when I send power through the circuit. I sent around 3amps at 1V for at least 5 minutes. Nothing was heating up. Heatsink was removed.\nI've run flux under the CPU and heated it up for an extensive amount of time. After that I did another ultrasonic cleaning. No change. Any ideas what this might be?"
