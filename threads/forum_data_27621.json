Think before you replace :)\n\nInject Amperage, more voltage will not help heat things up. Best to start at a low voltage like 1V and put the Amperage at 1A and start going up until you feel things starting heating up. Only increase the voltage if you can't inject more amps because the voltage limit is reached\nI can not recommend putting the voltage at something high (>1.7V) in case its leaking away into a circuit that requires a lower voltage so you don't blow it up though"

Not a lot of chips are going to like that.\nHow are your wires connected up?\n\n0.79 volt @ 1Amp is alright. Your supply is not malfunctioning given that either your voltage is set at 0.79 OR your current limit is set at 1Amp.\nIf nothing is heating up you can increase the current limit until something is."
