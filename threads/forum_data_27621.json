Front side of the board looks clean but back side has plenty of pubes, food, and nasty human junk, but I don't see any liquid damage. PP3V42 present, PPBUS_G3H present, but PPVRTC_G3H and PP3V3_S5 are going crazy. On pins 1 and 2 of U2600 I measure them and PPVRTC fluctuates between 3.3 volts and 3.47 volts and PP3V3_S5 jumps from 0 volts to 3.3 volts. Does this mean that U2600 has issues or could it be something else?"

Think before you replace :)\n\nInject Amperage, more voltage will not help heat things up. Best to start at a low voltage like 1V and put the Amperage at 1A and start going up until you feel things starting heating up. Only increase the voltage if you can't inject more amps because the voltage limit is reached\nI can not recommend putting the voltage at something high (>1.7V) in case its leaking away into a circuit that requires a lower voltage so you don't blow it up though"

I think I\u2019m gonna use this as a donor (for whatever is still good on it) just because I think you\u2019re right it\u2019s gonna be a nightmare at this point. I appreciate all your guys\u2019s help with this one learned a TON from this board as this is is the first I\u2019ve ever had with no power like that I\u2019ve only had sensor issue Macs, no backlight Macs and easy JTAG removal ones so this was definitely my first true challenge repair. Next time, I\u2019m just gonna have to be a little more careful with a problem like this, but I definitely think this one will help for the long term."
