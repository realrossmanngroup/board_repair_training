First of all; The logic board is in excellent condition. Absolutely clean and looks new. \nThe problem is that the machine works and runs perfectly normally when the battery is unplugged. When I have the original battery in it boots as it should, but quite quickly the backlight flashes and then goes out. It takes 20 v and charges the battery with 3.9-4.0 amp, but the backlight disappears. Without battery: normal power consumption\nI have tried three different batteries and it does the same thing.\nI think it might be <CHIP>U5000</CHIP> (SMC problem) and will look at <SIGNAL>TCON_BKLT_PWM</SIGNAL> line tomorrow at the office. If anyone has an obvious solution, I'd like to hear it :-)\n\nThank you all and especially 2informaticos who allways gives good vibes and advices.\n\nGood night:-)"

What is wrong with the topcase? I do not know but something interfear with the backlight. Take a look at the picture battery and screen alone works fine but when it comes into the topcase funny things happens. I will find a new topcase amd voila ‚Ä¶ should work. Sorry for all the ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù:) and Thank you again. All fine nowüôå"
