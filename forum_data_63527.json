        "message":"Haven't got too much experience with this board, so bear with me.\nThis board came in as no power after some liquid damage to the middle portion of the board (i don't see this often as liquid usually hits the 'wings' on these boards). No Corrosion on the CPU\/GPU Area luckily, but only on the backside of the board, concentrated mostly around UA600and U9801\n\nThere was a problem with RA602 being blown, which i think prevented the board from posting. After cleaning up corrosion in that area, reflowing U9801 mostly,  and replacing the resistor RA602, the board boots. \nHowever it's terribly slow. \nThere is no higher than normal fan-activity, and HWMonitor doesnt report anything strange i think. (it reports 129C on CPU Core 8, but thats weird because this machine is a 6-core cpu) see attached photo for all sensors.\n\nI think it is being throttled, I cannot really verify with Intel Power Gadget, because that won't run on this newer macos (can't activate it's kext)\n\nIf i measure around U4800 circuitry, i get SMC_PROCHOT_L signal (what i mean is: the signal is reading close to 0V)\nHowever i dont know what can cause this.\n\nI think the voltage divider for U4800 (R4800 and R4802) is working,\n\nppbus is 12.6V\n\nvoltages of U4801:\npin 1 is 1.99v\npin 3= 1.20v\npin 4 = 3.3V\n\nvoltages for U4800 are good, but pin 6 and 12 are low:\npin 1 = 3.3v\npin 2 = 3.3v\npin 4 = 3.3v\npin 6 = 0v\npin 9 = 3.3v\npin 10 = 1.2v\npin 12 = 0v\n\nDont know exactly how this circuitry should work, need a little help, thanks in advance!"

I managed to boot it into Internet Recovery with the help of an ethernet-cable (progress) but still extremely slow.\n\nAfter that i decided to take a look at the photos i made when i took it apart the first time, and noticed I never really paid attention to the tiny blue smudge on an area around U8250\nAfter measuring around, i noticed i don't have PP3V3_G3SSW_SNS coming out of U8250\nDecided to check under U8250 and sure enough,found that the pad #2 for PP3v3_G3H_T was burnt out!\nI rebuilt that using some wire and replaced U8250\nGot PP3V3_G3SSW_SNS back, as i understand it, it powers a lot Current Sense ICs which in turn talk to the PMU, so it makes sense that this thing was throttled i guess? What is strang is that the machine booted normally and the fans were spinning normally? Also no odd readings in HWMonitor?\n\nMaybe someone with more understanding can explain this better.\nAnyways, thanks for the help so far, and I'm glad i get to make money off of this thing, it's taken way too much of my time!"
