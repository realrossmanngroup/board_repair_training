        "message":"I have a 2011 820-2936-B board which had liquid damage.\n\nCleaned the board and I now receive green light (and amber when battery present) but no fan.\n\nThe heat sink gets hot.\n\nI've tested all rails. Only ones I am missing are the [FONT=Courier][SIZE=12px]PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT[\/SIZE] [SIZE=12px](Measures 0.005 V)[\/SIZE][\/FONT]\n\n\n\n[FONT=Courier]PP1V05_S0 (0.67V)[\/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Courier]The CPU is getting warm and I have the 5V S0 rail going to the fan.[\/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Courier]So if I am correct, the computer is turning on, but is missing some S0 rails??\n\nI checked the rest of the S0 rails and it is just those two I am missing. [\/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Courier]For the PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT I checked U7300 and I have the 5V S3 and 1.5V S3 going into the chip.\nI also have DDRREG_EN measuring about 3.3V, however I have 0V at MEMVTT_EN at pin 17 (which is noted as VTT_EN in small print next to PIN)\n\nWhen I jump over to what creates MEMVTT_EN I have PM_SLP_S3_L and it measures 3.27V and I have 4.97V at MEMVTT_EN_L and R3210 measure 9.97kohms.\n\n\n\nAm i running in circles here trying to figure out the PP0V75 or should I be trying to figure out 1.05V S0 instead? Or would fixing the PP0V75 help fix the 1.05 as 0.75V is higher up on the voltage rail list?\n\nThanks for any help!![\/FONT]"

If you stare at the fan, you will see it kind of barely \"wiggle\" constantly.\n\nIt does look like there is still a short to ground on PP1V05_S0 as both sides of the inductor in that circuit (at work can't remember if it actually labeled L7630) are showing a short to ground, diode measurement of 0.000 and 0.002. I plan on removing the inductor and seeing which side the short is on. At this point I would almost guess it will be on the computer side (not the side to the left of the inductor)\n\nIf I find that the short is on the right side, if I place 0.5v at the inductor pad, something should get warm, correct? I also wouldn't want to go higher than the 1.05v, correct, since I believe this goes to the CPU or GPU?\n\nThanks for any feedback!"
