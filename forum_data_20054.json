        "message":"Hello,\n\nThis board has no liquid damage. It had intermittent kernel panics and shutdowns until I addressed bad solder joints at U8900. \nIt is failing diagnostics with sensor error TW0P, which I think is airport proximity temp. Fans do not spin on high, however.\nI checked for 3.3V at U5523 and U5570. Replaced U5570 to test, no changes to behavior. Checked data lines SMBUS_SMC_1_S0_SDA and SCL, no oscilloscope available but fluctuations on those lines indicate that there is some kind of modulation (data?) on those lines. \nAny thoughts? Replacing U5523 will be a pain due to connectors in that area, would it be better to bottom heat?\nOr is it the SMC?\n\nThanks,\n\nStefan"

I looked at it under high magnification and the top looked a little funny.. almost like a chip was taken out of the top of it. \nPain in the neck to replace that particular component surrounded by the fan, IO board, and wifi connectors."
