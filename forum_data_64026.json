        "message":"No liquid damage found on the board. 3 ports were going at 5v 0.42A replaced UB300 as it had a short to ground on PP3V3_UPC_TA_LDO. That is now cleared and I get 3.3v on that line.\n\nThe board is missing PP3V3_S5 and PP5V_S5_LDO (not sure if they are supposed to be present at 5v)\n\nMy main concern is PP1v8_SLPS2R as this is showing in diode mode 0.008 ( 8.3ohms) should be 0.040 but when i apply usb power i get 1.8v on PP1v8_SLPS2R\n\nI hooked up my USB-C analyser and this gave me a fault to pin 33 on J3300 so i replaced U3000 and that's now cleared. No other faults reported with the USB-C analyser.\n\nI've tried DFU mode - failed\n\nSo i'm not sure if PP1v8_SLPS2R is correct and why the reading is low.\n\nAll 4 ports are giving the same reading and there is no boot loop.\n\nAny help is appreciated."
