        "message":"Hi,\nI'm not quite sure if this is a logic board issue, but since it may, I'm asking anyway. I got a 15-inch touchbar macbook pro with no keyboard and no touchpad.\nKnowing that keyboard goes into the touchpad, I immediately suspected the touchpad or its ribbon cable.\nThe cable got replaced but didn't help, so I ordered a replacement touchpad, and yes, it did fix the issue. Keyboard and touchpad started to work again.\nBut... When I click, I don't get the haptic feedback (but the click works).\n\nSo here's my question... Did I just get a bad (not as bad as the original one, but bad, still) touchpad ? Or is there something on the logic board that could cause the touchpad to work, but without haptic click ?"
