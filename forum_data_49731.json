        "message":"Have a late 2012 820-3302 imac come in for SSD upgrade. Original hard drive defective and needing replacement. During reassembly technician droped screen while unit had power which blew L9100. Replaced screen and  L9100 and have picture again but whenever the imac is turned off or in sleep mode the fan spins fast constantly. Everything works perfect including normal fan speed while its running. Checked and everything is plugged in properly.\n\nCould the fan be spinning fast while its turned off or sleep from the hard drive upgrade? Found this post stating that if pins 2 and 7 are shorted the issue should be solved.\n\n[url]https:\/\/forums.macrumors.com\/threads\/bypassing-the-hdd-fan-when-installing-an-ssd.1765854\/[\/url]\n\nShould we try this first or check something else?"
