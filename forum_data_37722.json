        "message":"Hi all,\n\nI have an 820-3476 that had no power missing pm_slp_s4_l.\n\nTraced that back to a corroded U8020.\n\nNow it spins and draws 0.14 amps. I have no vcore and cpu is cold.\n\nOn Q8150 i have all the inputs around 0.7v but All_sys_pwrgd is 0.2v (i think this should be 3.3v?)\n\nI replaced Q8150 just in case but no luck.\n\nOn U1950 i have SMC DELAYED, 3v42 and CPUVR_PGOOD_R.\n\nBut all sys is 0.2v and PM_S0_PGOOD, SYS_PWROK_R are both 0v\n\nany ideas?"
