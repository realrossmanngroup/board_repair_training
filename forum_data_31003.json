        "message":"Hi guys I have a macbook air that came in with liquid damage. Liquid at U6100 and I replaced C6100. Also liquid around SMC replaced: U3710, Q5158 & R5158 and did a SMC reflow for good measure. When connecting power the fan starts to spin (not 3 times though) and I get only a green light. After about 30-40 seconds the board switches off. CPU gets hot, I got SMC_PM_G2_EN on U7501 and when I connect a mouse i do get a red light so it seems the SMC is doing something. PPBUS is at 8.17v though which usually indicates faulty SMC? Any suggestions?"

        "message":"8.17V would at least indicate an issue with the SMC. The switching off after 30 seconds can be many things including the SMC. Also suspect are the traces and\/or termination resistors from U6100 to the SMC."
