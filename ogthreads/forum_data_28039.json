Did ASD and its showing th1H SMC IO failed.\n\nChecked U5550 and its good.\n\nResistance on R5550, R5551 and R5552 is also good. R5550 seems to bounce around a lot but compared with another board and it seems to match up can you confirm that?  \n\nany ideas? should i be looking into the smbus_smc line? \nWhen it powers on fan is normal and then at about a quarter way through the osx boot up fans slowly turn to full."
