The resistor is ok.\nSo, the other side of the resistor was missing TBT_X_SPI_MISO (3.29V) and this line is created by TBT Titan Ridge - Thunderbolt\u2122 3 Controllers (U2800).\n\nAfter replacing this big IC it started to get 20V and 2.2Amp, but cycling.\nIt was probably because I don't have the correct stencil to re-ball it and solder it properly. When removing it I heard a pop sound.\n\nI need the Stencil for this IC that I bought from China.\n\nI will come back later to post my findings."

            "message": "\"This line is created by TB ROM (U2890) this IC has its own firmware.\"\nError, this LDO comes from U3200.\nIn fact, only connects with C3204; for stability purpose.\nIs only used internally by U3200, for BMC communication with charger.\n\nBTW, 1V1 LDO_BMC must appear only on the CD3215 chip corresponding to the powered port.\nCorrupted TBT ROM (U2890) can impide CD3215 chips to boot correctly.\nThen none of them generates 1V1_LDO.\n\nTBT_X_SPI_MISO voltage comes from  PP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO, trough R2892 (pull-up resistor).\nIs a SPI data line and can't be diagnosed only be a DC voltage.\nIf no activity on that SPI bus, it should stay high to 3V.\nDamaged chip connected to it, can drop the voltage; U2800 in your case.\n\nMachine should boot without U2800, but may have problems with USB communication.\nTBT function will be lost, of course.\n\nYou've followed a good repair way, but try to avoid wrong assumptions..."
