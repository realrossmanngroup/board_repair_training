Also U4600 was blown but i removed it looks good now. I need to identify the chip exactly which one is it so i can replace it and get this imac working.  i know that it is SKYLAKE_PCH_FCBGA83 but just to make sure before ordering.\n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32853410821.html?spm=a2g0o.cart.0.0.72153c00Ve6pZp\u2213=1[/URL]\n\n[ATTACH]59535[/ATTACH][ATTACH]59534[/ATTACH]\n\nMany thanks"

If they match it's good.\n(also I'd be a bit more confident buying from see-ic but for Intel chipsets in general it's not too much of a problem buying from less reputable sellers)"
