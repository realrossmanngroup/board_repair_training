            "message": "Hi All,\n\nI have a board here which is pretty much want to smash into a million pieces, however the owner would not be happy if I went through with it.\n\nSo this board was originally liquid damage. This was repaired about 4 months ago. There where no issues after the repair.\n\nIt has been brought back in with it freezing at the login screen. This happens at the same exact moment, you can get the first letter of the password in.\n\nIts the same with known good OSX installation.  External keyboard and mouse is the same. The USB mouse lights up, so the board is alive.\n\nThe computer works fine in safe mode. \n\nAny hints. I have already put through ultrasonic cleaner, and performed component isolation. Can't see any corrosion on the board.\n\nCould this be BIOS related ?"
