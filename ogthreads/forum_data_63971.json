It would seem it needs to get hot before booting.\n\nDiagnostics show nothing, tried different SSDs, same thing, it wont do it on safe mode. \n\nAfter it boots it wont crash even if using the dedicated GPU in a stress test. \n\nThe error is as follows:\n\npanic(cpu 6 caller 0xffffff7fa7a13d8b): \"virtual bool IOAccelLegacyDisplayMachine::display_mode_did_change(uint32_t): Uninitialized NVIDIA GPU driver returns false\"@/System/Volumes/Data/SWE/macOS/BuildRoots/293eb31947/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/IOAcceleratorFamily_kexts/IOAcceleratorFamily-442.10/Kext2/IOAccelLegacyDisplayMachine.cpp:267"
