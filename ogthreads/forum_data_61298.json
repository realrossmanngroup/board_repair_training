            "message": "I've got a 2017 MBA which the customer brought in after installing Big Sur (I think they did an upgrade). They reported that after the install completed the MacBook wouldn't boot at all.\n\nIf I try and start the MacBook the fan will spin for about 4 seconds then stop and restart again. I've check the board and there's no liquid at all very clean. I also checked the power rails and they are all present all the way to CPUVCORE.\n\nI've tried to clean the ME (i'm not sure if it was done properly) and it's still the same. I've also tried about 6-10 different dumps that I have which I know have worked in the past and even tried one that I found on here '2017 - J1WK clean ME - working - 1.8Ghz_8GB' all of them are doing the same thing fan spin stop and then start again.\n\nNot sure what else to try and would really like some help.\n\nThanks in advance."
