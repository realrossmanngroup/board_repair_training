How ever I fixed it and now it has pp3v42 3.4 and diod mode 0.291. now the issue is some times it works fine then again stuck in apple logo at the very start. SMC reset works fine but after pram reset chime repeats. board is pretty clean and no sign on liquid damaged other side of the board. reflow the SMC but still the same. dont want to do anything else until I get a correct opinion.\n\nGreatly appreciate your support.\n\nThank you."
