I have an orange light, however, it does not charge. Checked all resistors around U7100 they are all OK, replace U7100, same issue. 2 pullups for the battery are 2K, seem fine too. Anything else I should check? SMC reflow maybe?"

If measure on D7050 Pin 1 and 2 both 0.726 (with it removed). With D7050 on the board (replaced for a new one) I get 0.522 and 0.518. Readings on R5381 and 5187 still the same. Might try an SMC reball? \n\nEdit there was some corrosion around D7050, could it possible also be a bad battery connector? I guess if I remove the SMC R5381 and 87 should read correct if the SMC causes the issue?"
