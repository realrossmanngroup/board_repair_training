However, when I plug the master USB port into another laptop to check if it is stuck at DFU, another port that I try to power the laptop starts drawing 20V, 0.0A. I am not sure if this is the sign of something.\n\nFurther investigation revealed a short on PP1V8_SSD0 as measured at C9132. Resistance to the ground is 1 ohm. Is it what I am afraid of ? (Dead NAND) ? Or could it be a short elsewhere ? Same capacitor on the other NAND is not shorted.\n\nI appreciate it if you let me know if there is anything else I can check."
