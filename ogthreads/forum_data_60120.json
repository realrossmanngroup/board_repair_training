            "message": "So I have an 820-00165 that I pulled out of my \"rabbit hole\" box. I'm pretty sure it just needed a new U7701 and some solder mask repair. So I put a new U7701 but not it draws a steady 450mA  but no chime amd no image. The only corrosion found was in the area of U7701. Now I am stuck with an LB that doesn't post. I checked the G3H rails which are present, PM_SLP_S4_L is there, RTC is 3.3V, PLT_RST_L is 3.3V. Not sure what to check next. I get a pulse on PIN 6 of U6100 when first turning on the LB but when I plug a USB stick into the USB port, It is just a solid light, no blinking."
