But now the screen goes off when we open the lid and it turns on and stays on when we close the lid.\nI have searched on internet and found too many articles and videos about flexgate off 2016 Macbooks but nothing about A1278.\nSo definetly need some help to find out where to look or check.\n\nThank You.\n\n-Emre"
