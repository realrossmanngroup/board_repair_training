            "message": "Got a 820-01041 in that does not appear to be liquid damaged , but it was worked on before. It has 5v 0.01a on all 4 ports. Found PPBUS_G3H was shorted to ground through U7220. Replaced that and the short was gone but still have the same issue with 5v 0.01a. PPBUS is 0v and PP1V8_SLPS2R is also 0v and not shorted to ground. Wondering if I should continue on this or is this a dead CPU due to shorted U7220?"
