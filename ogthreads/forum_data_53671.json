            "message": "This is by far the worst backlight I have ever fought!\nit came in for no backlight water damage. Very slight water damage around C7793 and WX7720. Neither appeared to require rework.\n\nFailure mode 1 Comes on then fades away after a 1 second. Voltage on Cathode of D7701 just slowly fades and screen is black. 22v, 17v, 16v after several seconds.\nFailure mode 2 Back light does not even come on. 8v on D7701 cathode.\nFailure mode 3 (works fine. Not a failure at all)\n\nTesting / repairs done so far.\nDiode test to D7701 cathode is .576 \"perfect\"\nFlex board test \"no change\"\nThermal board test (hot / cold) \"no change\"\n\nFeedback XW7720 was reworked. (and tested by soldering on to pad 5 on U7701 while it was removed and resistance testing while flexing board).\n\nU7701 ( 2 times) \"all resistors in this area were checked for proper values\"\nJ830 LVDS connector (R7717-R7722 values verified)\nC7796, C7797, C7799, C7712, C7713\nD7701\nQ7706\nQ7707\n\nRan jumper to VIA and it fixed nothing! Failure mode 1 persists.\nisolated VIA on both sides from D7701 & U7701. Worked perfect the first try then entered failure mode 1!\nRan jumper from U7701 LCDBKLT_BOOST to anode of D7701 failure mode 1."

            "message": "The Hell has ended.  It was a compound problem.  Bad board & bad DC-IN.   The board had a bad backlight.  I tested it on the bench with a test monitor and my DC-IN.  it was bad.  Not sure what fixed it.  U7701, or the VIA.   When I put it in the machine the DC-IN was bad on top of it so I was chasing my tail around.   Originally I had tested with my test DC-IN and the back light didn't work.  When It worked on the bench it failed in the unit.  When I threw in my test board it worked but I didn't hook up the ribbon.   I never put two and two together and was chasing my tail round and round.   It wasn't until I gave up on the machine and swapped the board,  changed it's SN and then discovered it was doing the same thing that I realized I was making assumptions about the DC-IN. \n\nWhat made this so hard to figure out was how intermittent the DC-IN failure was on top of it all!  Because it worked on the bench I was not surprised because it was very intermittent.  I never once thought the DC-IN.  I couldn't get it to fail long enough to measure!  \n\nI sure feel stupid!\n\nThanks John and 2informaticos for the guidance."
