Seems fine. \nFound a script online claiming the shut downs are caused by a lower power state bug in the CPU that causes failure when the CPU enters a lower power state. \nBefore running the script I was getting shut downs ever few mins. Been going for a few hours now with no issue. \nIs this legit? Or am I getting a placebo effect."

Is there proof in older firmware that they dont drop voltage that low?\n\nIs this literally a flaw in Intel Power States where the CPU is put at such a low voltage it crashes because of not having enough power to sustain the processes required? Like when you undervolt a PC intentionally to save battery or reduce heat? Or in the opposite spectrum not enough power when over clocking a chip and causing a crash in the same respects."

            "message": "Yeah just recently got on here. long time lurker. Yeah its basically like undervolting instability. It actually panics (im almost certain), but there is no time to log it anywhere before the thing dies. Im quite certain there was an efi update in 2016/2017 that helped battery life by a few percent by dipping into that low power state. Watch it in Intel Power Gadget without the tool running and you will see what i mean. If you can find one on original EFI it wont ever go that low. My speculation is that the CPU was not designed to handle that power state, and a decent portion of the 3662 and 3787 are affected. Not enough to warrant a recall or an efi rollback of course. That only took 3 year and every 2011 ever made ;) . This is in use on a few thousand MBPs right now with nothing but positive results. Patient zero is a local customer here about a year and half ago (if memory serves) and he is still up and running just fine.\n\n\nAlso, watch power gadget in windows, and voltages from a terminal in linux.  Never touches it, never crashes.  Absolutely OSX telling it to go low."

Getting the 6708 from Mouser is the safe option here, but I have gotten 6708 from China that were real new too."
