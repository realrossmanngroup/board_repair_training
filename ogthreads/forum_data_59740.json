Multiple corrosion points, mainly around charging ports.\n\nR2890 was fallen off, replaced now\nC3501 knocked off, left off as filter cap\n\nUsb charging voltage is up, but I'm missing output from U7000\n\n\nSMC_RST_L - 3.3V\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.3V\nHPWR_EN_L - 3.3V\nTBA_VDDA - 5V\nPPDCIN_G3H - 20V\nPPBUS_G3H - 0.3V\nPPVBAT_G3H_CHRGR_R - 0.3V\nPM_EN_P3V3_G3H - 5V\nSMC_BC_ACOK - 3.3V\n\nSeems like its failed U7000, what you guys think? Shall I replace and retest or is there something else to test before it?\nNo visible shorts or unexpected heat signatures\n\nThanks"
