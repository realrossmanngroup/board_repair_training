Board spins up and performs fine, just no power button \u2026. \n\nit did also have a bad camera.  I have not tested the replacement yet but I guess this could be a faulty SMC too?"

I will post back the conclusion tomorrow."

I've now tried two other trackpads in the device.  Both allow the ONOFF line to be pulled low but on both the trackpad chip behind the connector to the board gets instantly extremely hot.  They also stop the laptop booting (power resets continually, or the boot gets almost to the end and then shuts off, no chime.  Both these are from other chassis on my bench so it is possible that both are bust.  But before I order new ones, what's the view of people here? fan spin, chime, boot and no heat when the trackpad without the working power circuitry gets plugged in!  \n\nare there schematics and boardviews for the trackpads?  there is no evident corrosion on any of the trackpads, nor any signs of damage.  and although I have no reason to doubt you, 2informaticos, I cannot find any pins that have continuity between the flex connector to the board and the flex connector to the keyboard.  So what pins should be connected for the power button?   [/SIZE][/FONT][/COLOR][/LEFT]"
