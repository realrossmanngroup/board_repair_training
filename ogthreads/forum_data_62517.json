No Liquid damage found.\n\nWas getting 5v 0.3 amps from charger. \n\nPP3V3_G3H was at 2.7V\nNo short on PP3V3_G3H. \nAll other lines on U6903 were present and correct.\nSurrounding resistors were correct values\nReplaced u6903. \nPP3V3_G3H is now 0.7V\nReplaced u6903 again\nSame Results.\ninjected 3.3V to PP3V3_G3H\nUB400 Getting hot. \nPP3v3_UPC_TB_LDO was shorted to ground. \nRemoved UB400\nPP3V3_G3H is now at 0.3V\nCustomer decided he now just wants data. Tried Lifeboat connector. nothing shows up. \nRemoved L6900 to see if which side the voltage drop is occurring. \nWith L6900 Removed. P3V3G3H_LX is back to 3.3V.\nVery confused here. No shorts on PP3V3_G3H... why is it being pulled down still??\nIf i inject 3.3V to PP3v3_G3H the and plug in the charger.I get 20V 0A"
