            "message": "Got a board in that someone had ripped the battery connector off of (or poorly removed it). No damage to the board itself, and I replaced the battery connector and all seemed well. After a few minutes, the fan ramped up and trackpad movement slowed. Ran ASD, and the board failed all kinds of sensor readings tests:\n\n[B]- SMC: 0x0 SMC Critical Sensor Check [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- THSP Thunderbolt Proximity [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- TM0P MLB Top Side [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- TW0P Airport Proximity [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- Tm0P Memory Proximity [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor\n- Ts0P Trackpad Skin [FAILED] -- SMC is unable to read sensor[/B]\n\nNo liquid anywhere on the board, and none of those appear in the schematics, but the board is clean. Was testing board in my known-good test assembly, but tried it in my 2nd test assembly just in case, and it still fails the same tests. Known-good battery, known-good trackpad, known-good trackpad cable, known-good DC/IO board and known-good DC/IO cable.\n\nIs this a failed SMC? Issues persist even with battery removed, so I don't think it's related to the new battery connected I installed.\n\nAll help appreciated, duke."

            "message": "Got this one figured out. Removed U5810 to check for corrosion, and it was clean; same issues persisted; pulled SMC to check for any corrosion, it was clean, replaced with known-good, same issues. Touched up trackpad connector just in case it had some funky cracked/bad joint, same issues. Ended up replacing U5810 to be sure, since it was the simplest last-ditch effort, and problem seems to be resolved. Passes ASD.\n\nThanks again, duke. Another example of a chip that reads well, looks fine, no liquid, diode mode measurements good, but bad. Learned something new with regards to EFI/OS ASD and how information passes through U5810--will be helpful. Solved."

I knew it was related to the board itself, either the SMC or the U5810 like duke mentioned. U5810 tricked me because it had correct readings all the way through. :)"
