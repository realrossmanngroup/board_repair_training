So far I have changed:\n\ncaps relating to PP20V_XA, the USB-C controller chip and even as far along as U7000 where there was no liquid spilled. The problem I\u2019m getting is at F3000 I get 5.2V but it pulses from 5.2V down to 0v and very quickly recovers. If I measure at F3001 I get 5.2V that also pulses but only down to around 4.8V and then recovers. This would suggest to me that something is shorted but I cannot find it.\n\nPP3V3_G3H is present but pulsing.\nPPBUS_G3H is 0.2v and not shorted.\nU7000 is getting all voltages it needs but they are pulsing up and down.\n\nthe thing is, if I remove U7000 then measure at F3000 or F3001 then the pulsing stops and the voltages are 5.2V solid.\n\nam I missing something here?\n\nany help is greatly appreciated."

U3100 had no liquid near it, it was all on U3200 side. F3000 is also pulsing but only to 4.8v\n\nSMC_USBC_INT_L on R3038 is pulsing but from 0v-1.8-2v and back to 0v. I'm not sure if it's just trying to turn on, something shorts out and it dies again."

When I remove anything to do with PP3V3_G3H from the system such as U7000 then it stops pulsing. I tested this by removing R6923 which is a 0 Ohm resistor and the pulsing stopped but no PP3V3_G3H was present.\n\nDiode mode measurement on R6923 is 0.320 but if I remove that resistor then pin 1 goes up to around .480 and pin 2 which is the G3H side stays at .320"
