            "message": "Hello,\n\nCan I get a quick opinion here? A board with water damage mainly around C7002 area, was cleaned up, and resistors and capacitors were replaced.\nAll works fine, other than the power button. I can login, and do everything, every key works but if I shut down, no way to bring it back up other than removing the battery and then connecting it to the charger. When it is on, power button does nothing.\n\nNo obvious damage under the button, and it doesn't feel like a faulty button given that all others are working.\n\nSince the area I was working on seemed to be related to reset signals I am wondering how can I continue troubleshooting.\n\nThanks"
