            "message": "I have this board that was sent in for water damage. When I plugged it in the trackpad would click and the ammeter read 19.8v and 0.55A\nThe only components that looked like they had any kind of liquid damage were C8412 , C7660 and Q7660. I replaced C7660 and C8412 and put the board in the ultrasonic.\n\nNow the board is still doing the same thing except now the amps keep going up all the way until 2.49A but still nothing on the screen. \nL7670 is showing 5v\n\nI'm not sure exactly where to start troubleshooting since the trackpad still works and gets power to it and if I measured correctly I dont think there was any voltage on PPVCC_S0_CPU."
