            "message": "I have a 2019 MacBook Pro board 820-00850 that came in unresponsive. A DFU Restore seemed to fix the issue and the machine was up and running. Several days later, the machine suddenly was stuck at 5V USB-C and I found that two CD3215s were dead (U3200 & UB300). I replaced them and the machine was running again. Then, another week later the machine was returned to me unresponsive again and the same two CD3215s appear to have died. What could cause this repeated failure?"
