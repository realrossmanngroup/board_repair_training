All components in the area measure correct but I am not getting LCD_PSR_EN.\nCan someone tell me what the PCH needs to output that signal, or any information on how this circuit works would help.\n\nThanks,\n\nMike"

            "message": "Yeah sorry it is 2015. The problem is that there should be a short pulse on L8300. This enables the system to identify the LCD. If there is no LCD detected it will go low again. So you cannot just check these signals after you turned it on. Check for a pulse on PSR_EN, preferably with a scope as multimeter may be too slow to catch. Check soldering on U8330 again and check if 3V is on pin 8."
