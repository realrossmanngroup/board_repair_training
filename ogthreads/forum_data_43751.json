I am switching every site to separate hosts and vbulletin to vbulletin cloud w/ phone support, so now there will be a team of people ensuring that the site never goes down. There may be a little downtime/funkiness during the transition, but after this I am hoping to never have an issue with the forum again. Thanks for patience during this time!"
