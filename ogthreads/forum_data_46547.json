When start work's perfectly but when i turn it off and try to turn on again i can see the fan sniping 1 sec and off! \n\nIn my opinion this macbook, because shut down suddenly very times corrupted the bios! \n\ncan you check this original file if it was working properly?? \n\n[url]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GJytmcqtE4xzGEdv1hEAsNo9Jz8VLqlf/view?usp=sharing[/url]\n\nthanks"
