            "message": "Hi, have this Mac air, had a tiny drop of corrosion on C7137 but board looks very clean, replaced that capacitor. Mac starts spinning, turns off, then keeps spinning. I have all voltages going down to DDR 1.2v and CPU 1.05 and 1.8v, on display voltage only get 6v and then starts to drop, I have no PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_R and no EDP_PANEL_PWR but I do have 3.3v S5 on VIN at U8300. Mouse lights up. Ideas? I have tried another working LCD, same."
