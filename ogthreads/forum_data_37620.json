I'm assuming there should be a voltage going from pin 24 on U7400 to U2650 to tell it CPUIMVP is good.\n\nIt seems like I have voltages in where I should on U7400 so I'm not sure why it isn't outputting CPUIMVP. Unless Pin 22 (ALERT) tells it to turn off when a voltage is present on that pin. (currently 1.1v) \nI can't find a pdf for MAX15119GTM"
