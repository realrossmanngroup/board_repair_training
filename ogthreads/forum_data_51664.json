            "message": "This 820-3437 turns on but also off again after a few seconds. I tested the board outside the case and same thing. after it turned itshelf off i can turn it back on without any problems. Sometines it turns off during RTC-reset and sometimes it stays on for a few seconds. But it never made it to an OS. I cant see any obvious damage except some scratches between D7005 and R7005/06. I guess that somebody slipped while screwing in the AP screw (picture attched - also the antenna cables were not routed correctly). I checked everything in that area aswell as PPBUS and battery currens sensing but everything is fine... It came direct from apple ant they replacetdb the topcase and battery for some reason... That took forever and the customer wont wait any longer and also wont pay for more unnecessary fixes... Is there any hope fotr this one or is it just a waste of time?"
