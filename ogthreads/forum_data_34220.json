No obvious liquid damage anywhere.\n\npp3v42 0.2v\nppbus_g3h 0.585v\n\nshort to ground on pp3v42.\nremoved L7095 - short is on system side (pin2) 0v diode mode 0ohm\nspent some time removing caps on pp3v42(to oneside then checking for short then putting back) \nc5120,c7099, c7098, c7095,c9510, c3740, c7102, c4820, c4650\n\ntried injecting some voltage into pp3v42 (pin 2 l7095 with it removed) \ni'm concerned about putting to much power into this rail - the schematic says 300ma max - i hit that at 0.3v what is \"safe\" to put into pp3v42 ?, previously shorts here have been obvious for me.\n\nAny suggestions please ? - possibly shorted SMC ?"
