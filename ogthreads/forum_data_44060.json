I really don't have time to fix them and am looking for someone in the USA to fix them.  don't really trust anyone on ebay to do it.  there really isn't any rush to fix them so you can take your time.  Some have been worked on, some haven't.  looking to spend 150$-200 per board.  is anyone interested?"
