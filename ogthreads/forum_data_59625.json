            "message": "Hi all.\nI have3 a mid-2018 MBP A1989 (EMC3214), that makes a popping/crackling sound when the unit gets hot.\n\nI've removed the base cover and cleaned the fans - which were already spotless, and seem to spin fine with zero resistance.\n\nI thought that the microphone may have been picking up some sort of electromagnetic interference from the right hand fan, however I've muted the microphone, and also muted the speakers, and I can still hear the sound.\nI also disconnected the speakers, with no change.\nI also reset the PRAM/SMC.\nI tried installing SSDFanControl, but it doesn't correctly detect the fans on this model.\n\nThe noise seems to come from the right hand side to the machine, and if I manually stop the fan, the noise ceases immediately.\nSo it should be the fan, however I've never heard one that sounds like this one does!\nI've attached a recording of the sound, in case it helps.\n\nI'm assuming replacing the fan should fix it, but, any other suggestions or known issues anyone can think of?\nThanks for reading."
