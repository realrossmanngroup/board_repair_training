            "message": "Board has been liquid damaged, and it is powering up all the way to S0. I did have video on it about 1 month ago, it sat, now after having hooked it up, it has no video now. When I hook it up to an external monitor, the monitor [U]does [/U]detect a signal but never shows any video. \nD3452 was knocked off the board with traces ripped. I have stuck down new solder slugs and taken a diode from a donor board. When measuring D3452 on pin 2 I get pulsing 1.9-.800. But on pin 1 I get nothing.\nWhat should I be doing or looking for?"
