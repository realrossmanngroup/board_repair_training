We live in Florida so the customer thinks lightning. \nAt first I thought the power supply was the issue, so I replaced this, I could hear the capacitors making a constant but quiet whining noise.\nNew power supply came in, this did not fix the issue. \nNext, I found a short on C7845, so I replaced this and the short was gone. While looking for the short, I noticed when I put alcohol in the area, the top right of chip U7800 got extremley hot and would turn the alcohol to steam very quickly. \nSince I replaced the capacitor C7845, I do get the computer to power on, S0 is also present, I however get no video at all. \nThe diagnostic LEDS show 1, 2, are on, 3 is out, 4 is just barley lit, and 5 is off. See images."

I get to step 4/4 and it gets about 35% of the way there, then you hear the fan spin super fast (seems like it may be restarting?), then I get the exact error every single time shown in the photo below.\nSSD dead?\nDid not check out the voltages on the coils for U7800 yet. Gotta take it out of the iMac.\nOh, I also removed the CMOS battery on the back of the board because it was 2.8v. I wouldn't think this would make a difference would it? I got another battery coming in tomorrow."

I only get the 1 LED light presently (right before this I had no LED lights). This revive/restore is messing with the bootup sequence. I did also retry the restore, but it got stuck.
