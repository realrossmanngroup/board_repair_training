            "message": "I have this old Samsung SSD (MZ-JPV2560), originally from a 2015 MacBook Pro A1502, that is not recognized in Disk Utility and seems dead. In order to revive it, I'd like to try power cycling it, which can sometimes restore seemingly dead SSDs to factory settings. A tutorial is found here: [URL]https://dfarq.homeip.net/fix-dead-ssd/[/URL]\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"351px\"]60819[/ATTACH]\n\nThe recommendation is to unplug the SATA data cable from the SSD and let it sit for 30 minutes being only connected to power. Obviously I cannot unplug anything on this MacBook SSD, but I could cover up most pins with kapton tape before inserting. Which pins are essential for powering the SSD? Would you suggest leaving only a ground pin and PP3V3_S0 open? Or include the PP3V3_S0SW_SSD_FLT pins? Do I need SSD_PWR_EN?"
