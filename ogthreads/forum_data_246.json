I am a rookie.\nI get green and orange light on charger, boots, chimes, no back light at all.\nComputer will not power on by charger alone it must have battery to power on.\nInspected back light circuit to discover R9703 missing completely. Replaced and still no back light. Do not have backlight en.\nAppears as if it may have been cleaned previously so very minor evidence of corrosion anywhere\nAny thoughts?"
