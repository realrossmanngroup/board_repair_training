            "message": "Hello,\n\nI got my first dead MBA 2020 A2179 and I don't have schematics. \n\nMacBook looks perfect, no water, no drop, nothing bad on motherboard. Customer said he was working and then sudden death. Now, when pressing power button, nothing on the screen, no fans.. but the little LED near CPU on Fan side is on, it's a very tiny LED, you almost need to turn light off on the room to see that the LED is on... but it's on.\n\nI've connected USB-C current tester, I can see it goes to 0 when I press the power button long time,  after 1 seconds it takes again ~950 mA. I can't feel heat anywhere. So far, the board still in place, I didn't removed it. I tried removing battery connector, doesn't help.\n\n I want to be really carefull as device still under warranty, customer want DATA recovery.\n\nThanks\nSam"

Is this also a faulty CPU?\n\nThanks, Max"
