Need to know what component that is?[/PLAIN]\n\nSo ASD guide says that the TS0P is on the MLB and is a temp sensor.   The ASD test says proximity though.  So of the thermal/proximity sensors I have to to choose from on page 47 of the Schematics, how do I know which one to look for?"

I must have fixed this thing 10 times already and just thought I had it all wrong!!  Why oh why oh why did I not know that.  I kinda got the hint from you dukefawks but I guess I needed it in brail or something.  The great part is that I actually fixed two boards by replacing components and doing some detective work.  Bad side is what should have only taken an hour took 14 hours instead.  I feel accomplished and stupid all at the same time.  I learned that I really need to search this forum more before trying stuff out.  Why reinvent the wheel right?  Thank you"
