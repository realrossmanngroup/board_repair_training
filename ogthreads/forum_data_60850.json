            "message": "Can the screen be replaced on the 2016-2017 A1708 MacBook Pro with T2 Chip? WIll this chip see the new screen and prevent from booting?\n\nThe reason I am concerned is because I replaced the keyboard/topcase in a 2017 A1707 15\" MacBook Pro and it booted right into network recovery mode. When I swapped it back to old case/keyboard there were no issues.\n\nFrom macrumors.com:\n\n\"Due to advanced security features of the [URL='https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/14/imac-pro-has-t2-chip-with-secure-boot/']Apple T2 chip[/URL], iMac Pro and 2018 MacBook Pro models must pass Apple diagnostics for certain repairs to be completed, according to an internal document from Apple obtained by MacRumors. For the MacBook Pro, the diagnostic requirement applies to display, logic board, Touch ID, and any top case repairs, which include the keyboard, trackpad, speakers, and battery. For the iMac Pro, the software is needed if a logic board or flash storage repair is performed.\""

LCD assembly can be replaced without problem if you are able to find a good quality one, there's a lot of garbage on the market.\nActually it can also be replaced without issue on machines with T2, the problem is that it's extremely difficult to find good LCD assemblies for these, it's even worse than previous models. Better get it replaced at Apple."
