            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nThis one was LD and after UC it came back to life when U7000 was replaced (there was a hole in it). The LVDS connector pins were re-soldered and remaining board checked for shorts before powering on. All clear.\n\nNOTE: touchpad not working - left disconnected.\n\nNow it starts, it chimes, it starts booting but after 10 seconds the FAN goes to full speed and 30 seconds later - before finishing boot up - the screen fades to black. It stays there - powered on and the fan at full speed. I\n\nI also noticed that when you try to choose boot disk (pressing Option at chime) using keyboard arrows the change from one option to the other is REALLY slow. \n\nI checked U5515 and surrounding resistors  for corrosion and look good. \n\nShould I try a diagnostic (I think 3S138 is the right one)? Where should I look next?\n\nthank you dudes.\ngeorge"

            "message": "Ok guys, you were correct as usual. I had to remove the BIL connector to make SMC_LID go high and finish booting. The trackpad had also some crap on the flex side (not that visible) and after some cleaning, it worked as expected. All voltages are present and pull-ups measure correctly. \n\nI also re-balled the SMC incase the was some crap there, too. Probably unnecessary but it was a good experience (first time)! Photos are for viewing pleasure - maybe a video as well in the future.\n\nMany thanks!"
