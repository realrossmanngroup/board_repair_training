Every time it does this, the voltage is lower by 1v increments.\nIt ranges from roughly 3.8V down to below 2.5 and then loops back to 3.8V."

Thank you.\n\nIt was SPI_MLB_CS_L, athough not obvious because it was a corroded via quite close to R6101. The via / test pad does not show up net in boardView. Definately connected directly to CE pin on U6100.\nThis one (see attached).\nAnd bad R6116 & C6100.\n\nThanks again."
