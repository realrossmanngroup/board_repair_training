            "message": "Hello\n\nWorking on a 820-2915. Had two issues originally, first was GPU related, lines across screen, which has been repaired (rebelled GPU).\n\nSecond issue is it boots up to progress bar but never boots completely into OS. I've check and confirmed no corrosion present or sign of liquid spills.\n\nCould anyone please assist with cleaning up the EFI bios file that i've attached. I can't seem to find a clean ME region for this version.  \n\n[url]https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YKM4stXmFjoKO1h7VlU4WglAv5hoV1Sl[/url]\n\nThanks a lot."
