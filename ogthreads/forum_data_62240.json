Heres what the charger is doing:\n\n[URL='https://photos.app.goo.gl/YBo4waXNJRoAzo4e6']Google drive video[/URL]\n\nI have removed the board from the case and its pristine, not even any dust. The PMIC is covered by a giant metal shield on this board which is pretty intimidating. Apple is trying to make repairs more difficult\n\nWhen the unit first came in my shop I attempted to put it into DFU mode to restore the firmware but it would not recognize the keys being held down and would not enter DFU."
