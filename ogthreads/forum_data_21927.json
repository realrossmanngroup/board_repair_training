            "message": "Hi guys. \nWorking on a 820-00138 board with liquid damage. No green light on adapter. \nCleaned up and replaced U5110 and surrounding components.\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.26v\nPP3V42_G3H -  3.409v\nSMC_BC_ACOK_VCC - 3.409v\nSYS_ONEWIRE - 3.387v\n\nMade sure I am using original 85w Magsafe 2 however I only get 16.73v on f7005 both sides. shouldnt it be 20v ? I am also testing with a known good magsafe board. \n\nU7100 - Pin 17/18 - 2.9 Ohm\nU7100 - Pin 27/28 - 20.9 Ohm\n\nThanks."
