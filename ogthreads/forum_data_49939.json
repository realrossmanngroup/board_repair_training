            "message": "Hello all,\n\nI have this 810-00165-A board with no power or green light. I have verified the G3H voltage rails and have found PPVRTC_G3H rail to be missing. I traced it back to U1900 and found that itself is not getting any voltages except PP3V42_G3H on pin 13. The rest of the missing voltages are S5 voltages. Is S5 supposed to come on even when a light has not been produced at the charger tip? PP3V3_S5 and PP5V_S5 are both missing atm. Furthemore the one wire circuit is receiving SM_BC_ACOK and PP3V42_G3H and it is outputting voltage.\n\nHere are my voltage measurements of the G3Hot lines.\n\nPPBUS_G3H 8.1V\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS 8.1V\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS 8.1V\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL 16.5V\nPPDCIN_G3H 16.5V\nPP3V42_G3H 3.40V\nPPVRTC_G3H 0.33\n\nI found that U1900 is outputting on pin 1 a 32khz clock signal. Other than that it seems dormant.\n\nSMC_RESET_L is high and so is SMC_ONOFF_L\n\nCould use a good nudge in the right direction!  Mostly I am not sure if I should see S5 rails even when I have green light missing."
