            "message": "This has come from another shop who have said that they tested the screen and it works fine. \n\nNo image or backlight on the screen but works fine on external. I've tried SMC replacing the battery PRAM, all the usual but still no backlight or image.\n\nOn the diagnostic LED's they don't appear like the same as what we are used to... There is 5 in total and when you apply the main no2 lights up on it's own. When the power button is pressed light 2,3 and 5 light up with 1 being dimly lite. If I disconnect the screen I still shows 2,3,5 and dim 1. I think this is normal as it boots fine to an external screen. (no documentation can be found on the web with this conf)\n\nI can't fine the schematics or boardview for this model and would like to know if I could use something similar. This is a 2019 27\" 5K iMac.\n\nWhat i'm guessing I might be missing is the BKLT_BOOST but not sure as there is no image shown using a torch.\n\nUsing other schematics that use the LP8565A13RWC I can't see anything different expect FB8211 is between BKLT_BOOST  where as on this model one side goes to ground (don't think it's a filter on this model, the other sides is fine 0.35 using diode mode). I've tried inject voltage up to 1v 10A and nothing shows on the thermal camera.\n\nI've also checked for shorts around the board and nothing found. \n\n12v is present on PP12V_LCD\n\nNot sure what else to check. Any suggestions or a similar schematic?"
