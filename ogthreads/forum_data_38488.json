Opened to find the DC in unplugged and the display cable half way in, while over the clip. Also, the RAM shield was (overheated) removed and just placed on, and an antenna clip was ripped off the board. Owner then admitted that a shop attempted to repair...\n\nGet it all together properly - charges and boots fine but no key response at login screen or mouse movement.\nTrackpad clicks, keyboard backlight is on, power button will turn off and on, SMC can be reset at any point, PRAM reset works.\nUnable to option, verbose or safe boot through internal or external keyboard.\nSo, keys appear to mostly respond prior to loading the OS. \n\nNo indication of liquid exposure. Tested with known good cables and keyboard/tpad."

Wired keyboard must not work immediately with some adapters (insignia at least). \nReinstalled OS with similar results except now I\u2019m unable to PRAM reset and don\u2019t get keyboard backlight. Still able to use pwr button and SMC reset at any time. Not sure of previous OS version or if firmware affects this. Haven\u2019t even opened again prior to reinstall. \n\nAt login it prompts for keyboard/mouse. System report does not show any connected other than Bluetooth. \u2018Click\u2019 works. \n\nWill crack open open again and recheck the MLB connector. I\u2019ll include some pics shortly."
