This 4v9 rail hit PP1V8_AWAKE through C7790 next to it.  That runs to U7700 so I am sure that chip is gone.  It also runs to ROMs and a bunch of other stuff.    The only donor I have for this board I fixed so I don't want to start harvesting.   There could be 7 other chips plus U7700 affected.     I am just going to shelf this board for a rainy day when I have donors for it.\n\nThe liquid so so hard to find I missed it the first time around.  This board taught me allot about how these new boards function.  It was well worth the experience.\n\nI hope this information helps someone.\n\nCheers."
