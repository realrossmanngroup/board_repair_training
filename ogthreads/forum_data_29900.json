            "message": "I don't have high hopes for this one, as I don't see many TBT \"solved\" threads that align with this one, but hoping this one will be different:\n\nRepaired a liquid-damaged board; liquid was to R7186, C7121, U7100, U3310, C2952, C4691. \"Spot\" damage, and no runs or streaks; literally just these components with slight corrosion on one or more pins. Replaced all to be safe. Board fired up and works great, but Thunderbolt doesn't work. No signal or detection at all, and the standard \"No Hardware Found\" in system profiler. Checked area of board responsible for thunderbolt really well, but no dice. Very clean \"damage\", and I replaced everything that was even near the damage. I also replaced U3090, U2940, U2990, U3400. No dice. I realize I'm chasing my tail at this point, so wanted to post about it.\n\nWhat should be the very first thing I check when I notice no hardware is detected in system profiler, with regards to TBT? I wish the damn pins for each connector weren't so...plentiful, and jammed together underneath that shield. I can compare diode mode readings with a known-good board, but will wait for direction before proceeding with spending that time doing so. I *hate* troubleshooting TBT issues, and I normally wouldn't stress too much about it, but this is for a retail customer. Might just swap the board out, but would really like to learn and solve the issue.\n\nThanks in advance!"
