            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nso I have this macbook here and it have 3 problems. History not available, no water damage.\n\n1) Touch bar not working, changed with known functional touch bar\n2) Critical software update\n3) Graphic errors on display and external display, no errors when in safe mode\n\nAccording to the repair wiki I have unplugged all devices and started macbook with same errors. It is possible to install macos, but after booting there is still message with critical update. \n\nPP1V8_Sleep3_Buck3 = 1,8V\n\nIn my opinion the cpu/gpu is faulty, tried to reflow but same error. Before changing to new cpu, would like to hear some opinions about this. Someone attempted a repair in this area please look pictures. The coil is already replaced. Actually I'm stuck with this repair."
