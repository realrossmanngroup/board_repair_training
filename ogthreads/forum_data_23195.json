If you find to right agent they will be able to still get these chips. \nI am just saying that you cannot always just slap a 0005 on a 0084 board. I some cases it will work and in some cases you will need to change strapping resistors. In fact you should always change strapping resistors like R8613 etc. Compare boards and see how they differ."
