            "message": "Hello. I got this 820-00928 board in that was liquid damaged and has been worked on previously. UB300 and UB400 were replaced and there was still dried flux around them and UB300 was replaced with a CD3215B chip instead of a C00 version. I was getting 5v cycling on 2 ports, nothing on the port for UB300, and surprisingly I was getting 20v 1.5a from the port that corresponds to U3100. When it does take 20v, the fans start spinning on high immediately and the board does not seem to post. No USB activity or caps lock reaction. I found shorts on PP3V3_UPC_TA_LDO, PP5V_S4_T_USBC, and UPC_T_5V_EN. I removed both UB300 and UB400 and all those shorts were gone. Before replacing UB300 and 400, I connected the charger to U3100 again and it was still giving me 20v even with 2 CD3215's missing from the board, which I thought was impossible. I have since replaced UB300 and 400 with new chips but its still the same. Most of the time U3100 will still give me 20v and the other 3 ports will only go to 5v and then cycle on off. Sometimes I will get 5v steady on all 4 ports now also. Do you think I should try and replace U3100 or could this be a SMC issue?"

I tried flashing this chip with a known good BIOS from the same model with a clean me and still the same thing. I cannot find any knocked off components. Most of the visual damage to this board is around U4900, but I don't think anything in this area would be causing this issue."
