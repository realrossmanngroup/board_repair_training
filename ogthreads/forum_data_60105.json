            "message": "Let's say I have a board with some problem on a certain state Six (  G3h, S5, S3, or S0).\n\nSome of the power lines are ok, some have a voltage close to the value expected, but still out or range ( for example 30%-40% below the expected value) , some have a voltage in the mV range, some are 0V.\n\nHow would I choose the power rail to investigate first? Is there a criteria to follow in order to speed up troubleshooting?\n\nAlso, does the order in which the different power rails appear in the schematics have any relavence to troubleshoot ing order?\n\nAs an example, I have a 820-2530-A with problems on S3.\n\nPP5V_S3_REG=5V\nPPVTT_S3_DDR_BUFF=0.84V\nPP1V5_S3_REG=2.8V\nPP3V_S3_FET=15mV\nPP3V3_ENET_FET=0V\nPP1V2R1V05_ENET=0V\n\nOut of my gut, I would go with PP1V5_S3_REG, as I interpret the presence of a non zero voltage as and indication of something going which somehow get shut down.\n\nIs my assumption correct?"
