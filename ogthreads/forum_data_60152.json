It has following signal present:-\nPPBUS_G3H\nPP3V42_G3H\nPPVIN_HS_Computing_ISNS\nPP18V5DCIN_ISOL\nBut 5V rails are not present. when i traced the problem then found that on U7201 P5VS4_EN and P5VS5_EN are not present. But PP3V3S5_EN shows 2.9V.\nThen i found PM_SLP_S4_L is also missing. SMS_RESET_L and SMC_ON_OFF are present here. i also tried to have look on U1800 but could understand from where to start?\nwhat are the steps i missing?\nHow can i proceed to solve this and what else i have to check please provide suggestion and guidance.\nthanks"
