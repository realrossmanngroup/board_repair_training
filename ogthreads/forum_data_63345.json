            "message": "System running great.  Upgraded SSD and it boots but no video/screen.  Tested 5K Panel on another iMac and it works.   Tested with a known good 5K screen results same.  I also tested video cables screen to board and no help.  Is there a way to test the connector on the logic board to determine if it needs replaced?  If connector isn't the problem what smd is most likely?  I have novice soldering experience so I'm reaching out first just in case a smoking gun could be something else.  I did check the fuse.  Any help appreciated.  When panel was being removed it was done so without any snags or cable tugged or yanked out of the connector.  When I was done w/ SSD upgrade and did my plug in and test before adhesive strips I believe I saw a apple logo flicker but wasn't really watching for it and it was fast.  Trying to offer as much info can so that perhaps someone can tell this dumb\"blank\" to try??  Soldering skills limited but I've removed/installed 5K panels many times without issue."

            "message": "Sorry for slow response.  USB activity yes.  Connected an external via display port adapter and it works.  I tried a flashlight to see if video shows without backlight but can't see any video.  The 5k panel was installed on my other iMac and works.  The 5k panel on m other iMac also doens't work on this imac discussing 2015.  \nSo I am very confident in ruling out a screen issue or a cable issue because both work on my 2nd 5k 2015 imac and both don't work on imac i upgraded.\nDid that sound dumb.  Is it possible while removing the clip cable to have damaged a trace or connector pin? is it worth a try to run some heat with flux to reflow?  perhaps a solder joint broke while unclipping the cable?  \nThank you for responding."
