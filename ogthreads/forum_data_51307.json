            "message": "This board has no visible damage. It seemed like a straightforward issue, as I found PP5V_S5 to be shorted to GND. I traced it to C8270, which had shorted for unknown reasons. After removing it, the short was gone, but still no power on PP5V_S5. I replaced U7650 with a good looking one from a donor board. Machine turned on and I got an image on screen, but it shut down mid-boot and wont turn back on.\n\nMeasured: PP5V_S5 is 'jumping around'. It has a sawtooth pattern on my scope.\nI first suspected U7650 - may have been a bad chip or poor soldering. I took it off and replaced it with another one. No change.\n\nOther components on the PP5V_S5 rail look fine. No liquid or other damage found anywhere.\n\nMeasurements:\nPM_SLP_S5_L is mostly 0V but has little spikes up to ~1.5V\n\nP5VP3V3_VREF2, S5_PWR_EN, P3V3_S5_EN and S5_PWRGD are all showing a block pattern on scope.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is at 8.7V\n\nWhere to from here?"

It will pay for it's self the first week you own it. The software interface glitches and it is a pain in the ass at times but I would not part with it.  \n\nYou defiantly want a \"Pro\" the resolution is so important.  FLIR also overlays visual data with IR data so you can pinpoint the exact part.  I can literally identify a specific cap on a phone board and pluck it off. I use it on iPads all the time and MacBooks when trying to find which Tantalum is dead.  I have made thousands off the thing!"

Fed the rail 5V through my lab supply, no issues there.\n\nReplaced U7650 again to rule that out. Got 8.7V on 5V_S4. Q7660 burnt up again.\n\nFound that R7672, R7673, R7693 and R7692 are way off from what the schematic says they should be:\n\nR7672 was 25K, schematic says 10K\nR7673 was 2K, schem says 1K\n\nR7692 was 17K, schem says 15K\nR7693 was 2.7K, schem says 1K\n\nThis seems a little dubious to me, for all those resistors to be off like that, but I dont have a donor boards for this model to verify. Anyone know?\n\nReplaced Q7660, U7650, R7672, R7673, R7692, R7693, C7673 and C7693 all at once.\nHooked up adapter, heard a high pitched whine, notice amperage going up - whine stops, current draw back to 0.01 (voltage 20). Hooking it up again results in no whine and 0.01 Amps. So, it seems that U7650 is dying every time I replace it, but I'm out of ideas on what might be causing it."

PM_SLP_S5_L was mostly 0V but had spikes. P5VP3V3_VREF2, S5_PWR_EN, P3V3_S5_EN and S5_PWRGD all had block shaped waves on scope. I found out that Q7660 was causing a short to GND and replaced it. Short gone, block shapes gone on other rails and everything seemingly ok, but 0V on PP5V_S4.\n\n3. Replaced U7650 again and got 8.7V on PP5V_S4. I failed to notice a bridge between C7650 (PPBUS) and C7653 (P5VP3V3_REG3). Ouch. This is what caused PP5V_S5 to go to 8.7V and probably killed U7650 again. It probably did more than that.\n\nToday, I removed the bridge between C7650 and C7653, replaced U7650 and Q7660.\nMachine wont boot in SMC bypass.
