            "message": "Finally getting around to triaging some of the boards I have laying around that won't power up.\n\nI have a 820-00164 board that shows the green to orange on magsafe charger. Not really sure where to start with no power issues. I have the boardview up.\n\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.41\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.57\nPPVRTC_G3H - 3.32\nPP5V_S5 - 5v\nR7080 - 16.30 V\n\nAny insight on what to check next would be great. FYI this board saw liquid damage according to the previous owner. Would love to get it working since it's a 2.2 i7 8gb ram. Overall board looks clean.\n\n\nThanks"
