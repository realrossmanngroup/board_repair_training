I found on u1950 pad 8 missing also the c1950 didn't had a pad. I puled a wire from c1950 to pad 8.\nafter a closer look I found q1840 and q1842 problems and i replace those. After I fix it I plug it and the fan is spinning and I hear a dong this was without the screen. I connected the screen and when I tried to boot a second time it didn't work anymore. the fan is spinning for 3 seconds and it stops and it repeating and no dong this time. any thoughts?"
