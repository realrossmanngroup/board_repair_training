            "message": "G'day folks,\n\nRepaired a 3115 with liquid damage and got it working by cleaning up a few small spots of corrosion and replacing U6990. \nAs long as I leave the Wi-Fi and bluetooth disconnected (J3501) the machine runs great and passes all AHT and ASD tests, boots to a flash drive etc.\nWith the J3501 cable connected though, the machine shuts off at random points during the boot process. Sometimes when the apple shows on screen, sometimes at the end of the loading bar. The only time I can make it consistently shut down at the same point is when I hold down alt/option to select a boot drive.\n\nMy guess is that alt-boot immediately forces it to look for netboot servers on Wi-Fi so it shuts down.\n\nThe liquid damage was not near this part of the board, everything looks great and it has already been ultrasonically cleaned. This chassis works fine, Wi-Fi included, with other boards, just not this one. \n\nWith 34 pins on this connector and a lot of possibilities as to where this may be going wrong, I have no idea where to start looking. The machine does not stay on long enough for me to take measurements of any kind.\n\nAny pointers would be greatly appreciated! :)"
