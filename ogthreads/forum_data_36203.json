Anywho, PP3V42 on my bad board is 112kohms, sorry that was my fault for the bad info. .302v diode mode measurement and 112kohm resistance measurement. This is not too far off from the working board Duke is measuring on, and it is also even closer to a working board that I am measuring. PP3V42 does not seem to be short at all. Do you guys have any other advice?"
