But still no power.\n\nAnd I have checked all big coils on diode mode. Found short on PP3V42 but thats been sorted. But still have voltages written below after short gone. I saw green and orange light once then U5450 burned out. Changed it with another one from donor board. It was okay saw the green and orange light again for a second and again no more. Any ideas where to check?\n\nSMC_RESET_L = 0.V\nPPBUS_G3H = 0.7V on R7006\nPp3v42 = 1.6V on L7095\nPp5v_s5 = 0V on C7400\n3V3_S5 = 0.6V on C8180\nL7130 = Starts with 0.6V and goes down\nL7520 = 0V\nL7560 = 0V\nL7430 = 0V\nL7630 = 0V\n\nThank You"
