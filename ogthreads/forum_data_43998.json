            "message": "Hi all. I put up a post a few days back but it seems to not be showing. However, ASD did finally throw up 2 errors, ( was taking an age to complete). \nQuick recap. A1466 ( 820-3209-A) liquid ingress. Keyboard requires replacement. New one connected. System running very slow. \n\nRun ASD and 2 errors appeared, as can be seen in the pics. I have replaced the SSD with another and booted from an external drive. Still runs slow. I have replaced the thermal paste on the CPU with the same results. I still suspect a sensor. The logic board has no clear signs of corrosion under a scope. \n\nAny pointers? [USER=\"682\"]2informaticos[/USER] has suggested new BIOS with a clean ME but I do not have the equipment at this time to do this. \n\nthanks in advance.\nMarc"
