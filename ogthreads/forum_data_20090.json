Replaced it short gone, Got a green light w/o fan spin... PPBUS_G3H voltage was 3v. ISL had a hole burned through it so I replaced it.... No green light... Checked my soldering and even tried a new chip. I decided to measure PPBUS_G3H again and it was dead shorted AGAIN. Ran power, found the same mosfet getting hot... Removed it and short gone.... Stumped... What could keep causing the mosfet to burn out. Thank's Duke or Louis in advance."
