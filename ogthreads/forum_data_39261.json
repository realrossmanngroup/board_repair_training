Works perfectly with external display, does not detect eDP screen and Camera.\n\nPP5VR3V3 = 5v.\n\nI would instantly buy a new Display assembly if only ASD did not show that Camera is missing as well.\nCould someone explain if they are related to each other? I know that apple design is something you need to get used to, but meh.\n\n\nI am using 820-3787 boardview if anyone has idea where i can obtain a exact one, help appreciated."

            "message": "there's no image at all, it simply fills led matrix so it becomes opaque just from the start. i guess it happens when LCD receives its PP5VR power. \neDp is not detected at all, laptop boots to osX and Linux, it detects normal display port and HDMI if connected. I will try to check if Intel GFX is working, but i'm pretty sure it does since Linux does not load Nvidia/ATI drivers in live USB."
