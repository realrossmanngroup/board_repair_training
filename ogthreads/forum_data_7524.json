Soldered a new connector on, \nAs a persecution I also changed the back light fuse.\n\nPINS 21 and 22 for the lvds connector  have the solder pads missing.\nI bridged the pins together and ran a jumper to C9796.\n\nI also measured the resistance on R9715 and R9731 \nR9715 - 97k ohm\nR9731 - 194K ohm ( which is the 301k ohm) I have changed this resistor twice now and get the same measurement.\n\nFuse voltage on both sides - 10.9v\n\nI also tried a known good screen same thing, image but no backlight. Where should I go from here. \n\nI included a picture of the jumper wire i ran for the missing solder pags on pins 21 and 22 [ATTACH]7525._xfImport[/ATTACH] ."

When this is pulled to ground R9788 and R9789 create a voltage divider on LCDBKLT_EN_DIV. This gates Q9706 and allows voltage to pass. \n\nSo you need to check the gate signals of Q9707, and the voltage on LCDBKLT_EN_DIV.\n\nIIRC theres a via that can fail somewhere around here causing the issue but you should rule out R9788 and R9789 first."
