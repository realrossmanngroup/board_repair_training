Does not respond to SMC reset.\nIn measuring rails I got to PP5V_S5 which fluctuated between 3.8 and 5V.\nReplaced U7941 and U7200. Now a consistent 5V on PP5V_S5. Still no power though.\nMoving down the rails I got no PP5V_SUS.\nC1802 and C1803 3.3V\nADAPTER_EN at R5085 0V\n\nVery small patches of corrosion were found on a few probe points in the machine but no corrosion was spotted on any components.\n\nWhere should I go from here?"
