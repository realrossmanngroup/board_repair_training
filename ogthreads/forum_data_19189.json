Tested Q7035 & Q7030, got ~1v going to pin 4 of Q7030 but 0v going to pin 4 Q7035. Replaced U7000 and still no PPBUS_G3H (any higher). Resistance between U7000 pins 28 & 27 is ~20ohms, pins 17 & 18 ~2.2ohms. \n\nCHGR_CSI_P and CHGR_CSI_N are getting ~16.5v (should be enough right?)\n\nI'm thinking it's a fried SMC? The SMC looks to have two little bulges on the surface of it, is that indicative of damage?"

There was a short on U6990 which would drop voltage from pp18v5 to like 10v, replaced and voltage was steady pre-u6990 but 0v on pp3v42. Went ahead and replaced the SMC because fuck it why not right? And I got pp3v42 now. But I'm still not getting any g3h, and now u7000 isn't sending voltage to Q7030."
