I downloaded 820-01521 is not the same, but it is what  have at the moment.\nThis plate suffered a lot of oxidation, Q7040 and nearby components are well oxidized. The stresses I am not sure if I am measuring in the right place. L7816 and L7817 are with 34 Ohms in reference to the ground.\n\nVoltage: PPbus_g3h 1.2 V oscillating; PP3v3_g3h I don't know where to measure, follow the attached photo.[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59536[/ATTACH]"
