            "message": "Ok so this one came in most likely ultrasoniced before hand. Measured around and found all rails present up till PP5V_S4RS3\n\nPPBUS: 8.58\n3V42: 3.41\nVRTC_G3H: 3.3 and steady\n5V_S5: 5 volts\n3V3_S5: 3.3 volts\n\nThe only corrosion I found remaining on the board was on U7600. Replaced it because of corrosion, removed JTAG, also replaced U1950 because I got 3.42 volts on pin 8 and it looked good, but none of the rails coming from it were present. \n\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN: 3.4 volts\nSMC_PM_G2_EN: 3.4 volts\n\nPM_SLP_S4_L is missing.\n\nI checked the bios and clock area...clock chip looks good no issues around it the bios area had some corrosion very minor and the probe points all looked decent none were destroyed. I measured continuity throughout all of them to make sure there were no breaks in the line. \n\nPP3V3_SUS is missing as well and PP1V05_S0 is shorted to ground 0 ohms resistance to ground.\n\nIs this going to be a dead CPU/PCH or does this have hope and where would I look next if so?\n\nSMC area looks good too btw no discolored probe points at all."
