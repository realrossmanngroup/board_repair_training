            "message": "Hi Duke..\nSo I replaced the LCD today on the 2015 12in MacBook. Forgot to plug trackpad to motherboard in. Opened it and did it last however battery was still connected and I made smoke. Trackpad would then get really hot. And there was a burn mark on trackpad motherboard flex cable.\nTook working trackpad and cable from working 12in and still no keyboard or trackpad working. \n\nTesting voltages at connector and i have the following \nppbus g3h tpad flt - 8v\npp3v3 g3h kbd f - 3.3v\npp5v s0 kbd f - 5v\npp3v3 s4 tpad f - 3.3v\n\nAny pointers here please?"
