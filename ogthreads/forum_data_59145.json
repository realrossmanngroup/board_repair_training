            "message": "Hi,\nI have an A1502 here which came in with a backlight issue. Lots of corrosion all over the board edge near the hinges, which affected the display connector as well as the EFI ROM area.\nI got backlight issue sorted out and the laptop now works just fine, except for one thing.\nIt reports \"Unavailable\" for the serial number in About this mac, and ASD crashes and refuses to start at all.\n\nBlank Board Serializer also refuses to start.\n\nI have dumped the ROM, content is available here:\n[url]https://cloud.goudal.net/index.php/s/zLLK5WGjjNDdeYb[/url]\n\nSerial number on the back of this unit is C02LP13CFGYY but I can't find this sequence of bytes in the dump.\n\nAny idea what I should do here ?"
