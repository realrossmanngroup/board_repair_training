            "message": "Hello, back again with a funky one. I have an 820-01987 with no signs of liquid damage that sits at 20v 0.00a. When plugging the board into another MacBook it is instantly recognized as being in DFU mode every time it is connected. I have tried reviving and restoring multiple times and it always fails giving 1 of 2 error messages shown in the attached photos. Not sure how to proceed on this one.\n\nPPBUS_G3H: 12.35v\nPP5v_G3S: 0v (looks to be told to enable by T2 which isn't sending out that signal for some reason)\nPP2v5_NAND_SSD0: 0v (read other posts that you need this for DFU but the others have said they had a successful DFU and it restored this rail so I don't know.)\n\nThese T2 models are pretty annoying and seem to have many issues, unfortunately.\n\nThanks for any help you guys can provide!"

Looks like U9080 is bad based off thermals, there is also a small bump on the chip only visible at certain angles. I think this is the issue and I should have checked for a short first, don't know why I didn't before posting. Thanks for the help and sorry for wasting your time on this thread."

You are correct that it should not be 12v on one side and then short on the other, most reasonable explanation is I misread a reading or used the wrong pin. U9080 was shorted though and was taking 1.8a at 1.5v when injecting on  PPBUS_G3H_SSD0.\n\nDefinitely a weird short like you said, but it's gone after replacing U9080. I found a document I believe you posted on the forum showing the power sequence of the rails for T2 machines so I am going to just go through those rails and see what's missing for now. Thanks for the help so far, I will update the thread with any solutions I come across."
