They heated the PCH for no reason.\nThis is how the picture looks on the screen. Bad RAM or bad IGP in the CPU?\n\nThe screen is good. Tested with other logic board.\n\n[URL=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7287/26878123573_7891edd99d_b.jpg\"]https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7287/2...91edd99d_b.jpg[/URL]\n\n[URL=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7180/27386784012_8e832d2e56_b.jpg\"]https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7180/2...832d2e56_b.jpg[/URL]\n\nThank you."
