I have replaced touchpad cable and tested with known good keyboard also.\nI have tested J4800 in diode mode and all good. I have also tested all resistors on the smbus  smc page 40 of schematic and all red good also.\nI have tried reball smc and then replacing it but same issues.\nKeyboard works in High Sierra external boot.\nBut alt key boot select doent work from outside os and fan runs high.\nAny ideas appreciated."
