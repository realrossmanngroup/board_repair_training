(NO SHORT)\nPP5V_S0         as soon as probes touching it's 0.00 then quickly jumps up to 3.5V, 4.6V and back to 0.00 and so on...  (NO SHORT)\nPP3V3_S5       3.34V stable\nPP3V3_S4       as soon as probes touching it's 0.00 then quickly jumps up to 1.5V, 3.3V and back to 0.00 and so on...  (NO SHORT)\nPP3V3_S0       as soon as probes touching it's 0.00 then quickly jumps up to 1.2V, 3.4V and back to 0.00 and so on...  (NO SHORT)\n\nChecked rest of the rails and can't find any short\n\nJust poked probes around big coils and have stable 1V on L8060 as well..."

So technically there was no fix anyhow right? Or what steps would you take in that case? Sorry if I?m bothering you there, no rush anyway, it just good to take an example from somebody who knows more...\nI appreciate any help\nthanks very much"
