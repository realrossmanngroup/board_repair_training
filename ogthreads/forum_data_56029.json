            "message": "I got a 820-00239 that was pretty badly liquid damaged but was showing 20v 0.6a and the fans spin high but was not booting. When I opened the case, the back cover was covered in dried liquid and the black coating on the heat sink was completely burnt off by the CPU area, so it looks like this board seriously over heated at some point. The board itself was sticky but did not have much corrosion on it. There was some minor corrosion around the keyboard connector that I cleaned with alcohol. I also replaced the dried thermal paste on the CPU and put another heat sink on it. The board now boots to the OS but the fans still spin high and the battery is not being recognized or charged. Sometimes when I would plug it in, the fans would not spin high, but then it would come back if I rebooted. Sometimes only the left fan spins high while the right fan reacts normal, other times the right fan spins high and the left fan is normal. The battery is either not recognized at all, or sometimes it does see the battery and says that its charging, but it will not charge. I have left it for over an hour and the battery percentage stays the same and it also turns off if you unplug the charger. I tried putting the board in another top case that was working with another board I had, and this time it only shows 5v on the charger and keeps boot looping. It figured out it only does this when the battery data cable is plugged in. If i leave the battery tab screwed down and just un-plug the small data cable, it will boot with high fan spin still. I have tried new trackpad cables, replaced both fan controls (Q6000/50) and I also replaced the SMC with no change. I have ran HWmonitor and all temps are normal except airport proximity which is at 129 degrees but I think this is normal. Not sure what to look at next."

The connector itself looks perfect so I suspect D6950 is the issue. \n\nI'm not sure if the sensor for airport proximity is installed on these boards. The only thing I see in the schematic for this is X100 proximity (U5820), and none of those items on that circuit are populated on the board."

            "message": "I took another look at the keyboard connector and saw that the pins did not look very good so I touched them up with some new solder and this seems to have fixed the high fan spin, but I am still having issues with the battery. I have tried 2 cases and the board will show 5v and boot loop whenever the battery data cable is connected but boots fine with that cable un-plugged. I already tried replacing D6950 with no change.\n\nWhen the battery is connected and the board only shows 5v, SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA go up to 3.28v before it reboots. With the battery cable disconnected and the board showing 20v, both of those lines are steady 3.4v. Diode mode shows both lines are 0.366. Should I try and replace J6951 next or something else? Could this be an issue with U7000?"

            "message": "Yea it does appear to be a bad battery that was causing the issue. I got a new casing and put the board in it and it is charging and running off the battery. I'm not sure how, but this board definitely broke the batteries in my other 2 cases. One of the cases was a brand new replacement topcase I got from apple when I sent in a computer for a keyboard replacement. I do not currently have another one of these boards working to test with but does anyone know if there is a way to \"fix\" these batteries?"
