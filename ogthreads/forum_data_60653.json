Clean board otherwise. No ultrasonic yet. \n\nAny other suggestions for this?\n\nNo touchbar or keyboard backlight like usual. Boots in safe mode but stopped by update error otherwise. Only difference with this one from all others is that I can actually boot externally (still no TB). All others external boot is still stopped by update."
