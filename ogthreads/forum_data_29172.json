No liquid damage or other kind of damage.\nPP3V42_G3H is 3.4V at L7095\nPPBUS_G3H is 0V at several places I measured.\nChecked for a short to ground and get 0.001 - 0.000 which means there's a short right? (never dealt with a short to ground before).\nNow I don't have a power supply to inject voltage and see what gets hot so what would be the best way to go about tracking down the short?"

Will stick to voltages and amps as displayed on OEM Apple power brick depending on model but if Louis did a video on this that I just can't find or if there is a good writeup on how to use a power supply to find a short and how to wire it up, that'd be great. Also, got several magsafe plugs here I want to use with this external power supply, again need to know if I use + or -. I read mentions of + but prefer to take the word of someone here with experience over Wikipedia :)"

Heatsink is off of the CPU too. You mentioned something should heat up at 1-2amps so I am hesitant to go higher than that, can I go higher though? And how high can I go?"
