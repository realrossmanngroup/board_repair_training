External screen works fine.\n\nHistory is customer tried to replace cracked screen (which had image and backlight but with broken LCD). He somehow replaced the screen with the power applied and now no screens are working. Also not the original broken one. Tried two new known-good ones. The original with crack also works i another machine. So logic board issue here.\n\nIf something shorted because of connecting the screen while powered on what would be the first suspects ? I cannot see or smell anything burned...\n\nPP5V_S0SW_LCD = 0V\nPP3V3_S0SW_LCD = 0V\nEDP_PANEL_PWR_EN = 0V\nPANEL_P5V_EN = 0V\nPANEL_P3V3_EN = 0V"
