It came in with no power but occasionally gets a green light. When the light is on or off the PP3V42 is high (3.415 V), SMC_ACOK is 3.25V, I am investigating around U6990 and noticed that P3V42G3H_BOOST seems high to me as on one side of C6994 I have 6.8V and the other side close to the coil as 3.3V. What else should I check for?\nP.S. PPBUS_G3H is 1.2V"
