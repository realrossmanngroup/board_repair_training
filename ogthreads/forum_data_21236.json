            "message": "having a 820-3115 board, had liquid spilled on.\nU7000 was bad and replaced. then ppbus_g3h came out.\nit powered on but no back light, fixed that as well. then ran testings in OS.\n\nfound battery not being recognized. X mark,traced down to the SMC. and replaced it...\n\ndamn then the machine has no power on , green light is NOT there. check pp3v42 and ppbus g3h,which are fine.\n\nthen thought can be a bad SMC, replaced another two ... same story. then traced down and checked U6901.. pin 1 and 2 gets 2.8v.. pin 4 and pin5 are around 3.4-.3.4\n\ndoubting on pin 1 and pin2 . (2.8v), thinking should be around 3.3-3.4 as well.\n\nany suggestion?\n\nreally don't think the SMC is the issue at this moment now, since replaced 3 times already( do this often and it's not from donor boards, from solid supplier . preprogramed SMC for this model..i actually just used the first one we tried to replace ,reballed and used on another board, and fixed that one, so pretty sure it's not the SMC)\n\nthinking if anything around the SMC got heated up too much and got affected??\n\nany suggestion or experience on this?\n\nthank you"
