            "message": "Received this machine with no magsafe light and no power. G3Hot was present, SYS_ONEWIRE was all good.\nC6992 corroded but tested fine. Replaced and got a light but still no power. \nR5491 / R5492 corroded and resistance was 180-200k on pins 4&6 of Q5490. Power in, but not out pin 3. Replaced all and got power out pin 3. (Q5480/R5482/R5481 looked bad so they were replaced too). \nStill no power on the board. Followed pin 3 of Q5490 to R5499 & R5498. Both looked corroded, both were replaced. While replacing R5498, I noticed that a good amount of components in the area looked slightly corroded. Cleaned and reflowed the area - board powers on now. \nReassembled **with the correct battery screws** and all appears well. Run AST 1 and get a flag on the (A) DC in: 0.116A. Battery is not charging but is detected and in good condition. Computer runs fine, not bogged. In the OS it shows charging in the status bar, but in the system report is says \"not charging\".\n\nRechecked Q5490/Q5480 - Resistance between 4&6 of Q5480 is 250k. R5481 - 69k, R5482 - 190k. (they were both at 100k before powering on). \nFollowed PBUSVSENS_EN back to R7987, R7981, R7985, R7988, R7986, R7931, R7978. \nR7985 pin 1 = OL V to ground, pin 2 = 0.472v to G, 20kO resistance\nR7931 pin 2 = 0.337v to G, pin 1 = 0.554v to G, 100kO, Pin 2 = 3.40v \nAll others are between 0.4v and 0.6v to G. \n\nChecking around U7000 for short:\nC7025 measures 0.175v to G on pin 2, this follows all the way through F7040\n\nShould I be looking at Q7080, Q7030, U7000, Q7931, Q5480?  \n\nOther readings:\nR5491: Pin 1/2 to ground - OL, 100kO between 1&2\nR5492: Pin 1 - 2.416v, Pin 2 - OL to G- 100kO between 1&2 \nPin 2 of R5280 is 0.552\nPin 2 of R5281 is 0.555\n\nLet me know if other readings are needed. \n\nAlso, not as important, Bluetooth is not detected in AST 1..."
