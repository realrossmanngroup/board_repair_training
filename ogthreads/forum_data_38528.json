            "message": "Hi I have a Macbook 12 inch with no display external and internal also tried a good working display. The machine is turning on as all powerstates are there including S0 and cpu gets warm and has power. Display is missing backlight power as well as 5V, 3.3v is present. Q7706 has 8.6v on pin 3/4 and on the otherside once i got 8.6 and mostly 0.44v. For PP5V_S0SW_LCD, which is 0v, as well as U7701 the enable signals are 0v. Any idea how to troubleshoot this piece of junk :)?"

Had another couple of these that were crippled by the keyboard and tpad. \nif you get image, shut down and plug things in one at a time. See what prevents it from working.**make sure to disconnect the batt each time**. \n\nLet me know now what you find. Seeing a lot of this similar issue on these."
