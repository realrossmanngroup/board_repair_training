I tossed it in the ultrasonic to rule out any hidden corrosion.\n\nCharger is taking 29mA and not turning on.\n\nPP3V42_G3H=3.42V\nPPBUS_G3H= 8.56V\nPP3V3_SUS=3V\nPPVRTC_G3H=3V\nPP5V_S5=5V\nPP5V_S4RS3=0V\nPM_SLP_S4=0V\nPM_SLP_S5=0V\n\nI have not found any shorts on any of the main power rails. I replaced clock chip, reflowed SMC, then replaced SMC. No change.\n\nBad CPU? Where do I go from here?"
