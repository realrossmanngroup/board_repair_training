            "message": "Ok guys. My first problem to post and I hope you will be able to help with this.\n\nThis is a 2010 Macbook Pro 17\" that I purchased from a someone this week. Sold as 'not charging, tried 2 different chargers' and I took the chance on the basis they probably did not know you had to use an 85w magsafe. Anyway, got it, plugged in and green light straight away which is always nice. Battery is no good, so cannot tell about charging as such yet. Have checked both current sensing circuits for DC in and battery, both check out fine.\n\nOn removing rear cover I immediately honed in on two red flags. One, the fans were spotless. Two, flux around U7201. Someone has been telling uncle Jimmy porkies!!!!! Clean fans usually means someon has been in and doing something, albeit just cleaning someone has been in here first which I hate.\n\nSo, to the problem so far. Have ppbus_G3H at 8.4v. Have pp3v42 obviously and needless to say DC in etc. PP5v_S5 at C75205 was coming up at 0.7v.\n\nStraight to that U7201 for a closer look and although it seems to be the original (no tweeer marks) and seemed to soldered well, replaced it as a matter of course. Whilst it was removed I measured pin 1 of R7901 for EN signal and got a nice steady 3.3v as hoped. On fitting U7201 that dropped to 2.4v. Replaced U7201 again just to be sure chip wasn't bad and got exact same result.\n\nPin 1 of C7205 is showing 0.772v with both the new chips.\n\nA little bit baffled by this one. Racking my brains so ANY pointers will be gratefully received.\n\nThanks\nJimmy"

            "message": "Good morning everyone\n\nThis board actually got to me during the night. See if you can follow my line of thought here.\n\nThe mac had obviously been worked on by someone before as there was flux around U7201 and perhaps I should have walked away on seeing that. But like most of us I get a huge buzz if I can fix a board, especially those ones.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is the same (7.2v this morning) wherever I check it, which would not make any sense otherwise, so you are quite right to question the different figures that I hope I explained in my previous post. But what has got to me is the low voltage (near enough zero) on pin 22 of U7201. That connects to C7203. If that was shorted to ground, that would explain something so I removed it to check. Pin 2 of C7203 is supposed to be ground, pin 1 is not. But pin 1 solder point (with cap removed) is shorted to ground. Mmmmmm... Now I am on to something me thinks....\n\nPin 1 of C7203 goes to pin 1 of R7248. Pin 2 of r7248 goes to Pin 1 of r7249, which in turn pin 2 of R7249 goes to ground - a voltage divider if I am not mistaken. Problem is R7248 is shorted to ground on both pins, so is R7249. What the.......? No wonder Pin 22 of U7201 is showing next to nothing!\n\nNOW. Looking at the schematic and I think there is one of Apple's printing errors. Can anyone confirm if it is just me, but R7248 and R7249 are both listed as zero ohm? Effectively shorting straight to ground.\n\nI am just wondering if the previous person to attack this board replaced the originals with zero ohms because the schematic says so? Obviously the originals would have been correct. Two zero ohm resistors in sieries is not an voltage divider, but the techical term I believe is 'a wire'.\n\nAm I losing my mind, or have I found a bit of a problem?\n\nSo, if anyone can have a look at their schematic and tell me what R7248 and R7249 should actually be or an educated guess what be good so I can replace those two, eliminate the short on C7203 and hopefully we can restore life into this old mac after all?"
