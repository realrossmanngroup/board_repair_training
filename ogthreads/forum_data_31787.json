According to the customer, this one started slowly dying out on him about a year ago.\nEvery 15 minutes or so image disappears and sometimes the machine will restart and give a GPU panic error. Sometimes there is no image on boot at all. No image on external monitor.\nL9000 and PPVCORE_GPU are 0V when no image.\n\nPlease advice how to proceed.\n\nThanks!"
