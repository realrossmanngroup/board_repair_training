No keyboard or trackpad.  I can plug in usb, however that's it.  Power button works, but SMC reset, or options on bootup seem not to function.\n\n I do have PP3V42_G3H on pin 4 , but nothing on pin 30 PP3V3_S4\n\n How do I follow on the schematic where it's fed from. It shows the trace from keyboard connector , stops,  and a crap load of numbers ? What are these numbers next to it ?\n\n Page 38 shows a trace, and I don't understand where from ?\n\n Any help is much appreciated !"
