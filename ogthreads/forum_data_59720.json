            "message": "Hey guys\n\nSo I bought a liquid damaged MacBook Pro on eBay. Originally it had no 3V42 but after I fixed that I noticed that the display would flicker. \nThis Mac isn't intended for resale, I just need a Mac. Would the board work as expected if I were to remove the hall sensor with the exception of turning the screen off when you close the lid? I don't have any donor boards and I don't want to wait for Chinese shipping. The sensor looked pretty terrible so I have a feeling that's whats bad. Thanks!"
