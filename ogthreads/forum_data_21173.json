It was running fine before. \n\nI installed the top half of the MacBook on a known working bottom and it works fine, so we can rule out ribion cables, keyboard and everything else on the top half. \n\nIf I reconnect battery power and plug it into AC I see the white light on the logic board turn on but it won't turn on."
