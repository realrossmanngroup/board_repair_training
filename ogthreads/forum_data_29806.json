Cleaned it all up, restored pads and replaced several components:\nR1920\nQ1920\nR2023\nR1691\nU1900\nU1930\nU1950 and\nQ8150\n\nAll I get are the G3H rails and nothing after that, no S4 or up. No ALL_SYS_PWRGD which if I recall one of Louis' vids is a common issue with the 00165's\nProblem is, I can't figure out what creates ALL_SYS_PWRGD.\n\nIf I'm reading the schematic right it's Q8150 but this was replaced and I have continuity everywhere I should have it. I see no EN or ENTRIP pins so not looking for an enable signal. No short to ground either."
