Replaced all the corroded and suspected corroded components but still not getting power on s4. Here are the readings:\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.58v\nPP3V42- 3.4V\nPP5v_S5 - 5V\nPP3v3_S5 - 3.3V\nPPVRTC_G3H- 3.324v\nPP5V_S4RS3 - 0v\nPP3V3_S4 - 0V\nPP3V3_SUS - 3.3v\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN - 3.4v\nPM_BATLOW_L - 3.3v\nPM_RSMRST_L - 3.3v\n\ncycled SMC_ONOFF_L and went from 3.4v to 0.35v on PM_PWRBTN_L.\nPM_SLP_S4_L also pulses during the SMC_ONOFF_L cycle. \n\n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated. Thanks"
