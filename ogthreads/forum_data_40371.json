Yep I had the same issue a few weeks ago on exactly the same board.\n\nHowever, your resistance to ground on ppvrtc_g3h doesn't look like a short...\nOn my good bord I have 12kohms on the shorted one it's like 3ohms...\n\nLet us know about :\nPP3V3_SUS = 0V, Is it a short?\nDo you have P3V3_SUS on U8020?  You need both P3V3_SUS and PP3V3_S5 at U8020.\nAre you missing (most likely) PM_SLP_SUS_L?"
