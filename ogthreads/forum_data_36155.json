Now I have my g3hot back, but still no charge and no power.\npower consumption is stable at 0.07a, smc_onoff brings it up to 0.1 for a couple of seconds.\nno shorts found so far.\nis that an SMC and this board will never be great again?\nI have already invested too much replacing every single resistor around u7000 so i'm ready give up."
