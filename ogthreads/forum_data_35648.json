The keyboard back light even lights up, as though it was at the login screen.\n\nso far I have done all the usual SMC reset, NVRAM reset. No luck. Same issue when booting into safe mode and recovery, stuck on progress bar. Occurs with battery plugged and without. Also with everything on the logic board unplugged and with an external HDD."

The customers kid accidentally plugged a usb cable that was plugged into a power source into the USB port killing the the logic board. Took out the Audio codec chip, USB port power switch for the left usb, along with a couple diodes around those components. Also killed the SMC. I\u2019ve pulled all the blown components and replaced the SMC to restore power. Was waiting to confirm power fully restored before installing the codec chip. Didn\u2019t think the codec chip would prevent it from booting up. The right usb works after SMC replacement."
