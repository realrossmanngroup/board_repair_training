            "message": "820-00281 board was liquid damaged. Corrosion around U7650 and U6400. Would not power on. Replaced a few damaged components around U7650 fixed the power problem. Now no audio through speakers. Audio through headphone jack works. U6400 had corrosion underneath it. Replaced U6400, problem persists. Can change volume, switches from headphones to internal speakers when headphones unplugged. \n\nI have traced everything I can think of following schematic and all components around U6400 seem fine. \n\nDon't know where to go from here, any help is appreciated!"
