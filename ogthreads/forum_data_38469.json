            "message": "Hi guys, long term lurker, first time poster / subscriber here!\n\nI've got a Macbook 2013 Retina here (820-3462) that presents with a laggy trackpad and slow operation, kernel task up at 700% etc.\n\nBoard was very clean, [I]very small [/I]amount of liquid ingress (possibly coffee on one of the Poly caps underneath) but no corrosion and (seemingly) no damage done, or at least nothing obvious.\n\nRunning ASD gives me an IC0R error (I can get the error code if required but the L/B is on the shelf at the moment). Battery is charged to 100% and seems good.\n\nHave investigated the IC0R circuit, all traces look good and test fine, all components in the circuit test at their specified values.\n\nU5400 voltages:\n\nPin 1 / 2 - GND\nPin 3 - 3.3v\nPin 4 / 5 - 12.56v\nPin 6 - 3.3v\n\nI've replaced the U5400 as a matter of precaution because it originally was presenting at 0.2v which seemed low, however I'm not sure what voltage is supposed to be present at Pin 6? Have spent two weeks on Google but not found any information anywhere!\n\nAlso swapped R5400 with R5410 as a matter of testing to see if the fault 'moved' but no difference.\n\nBefore I throw this board at the wall, can anyone give me a clue as to what I'm looking for at Pin 6 to get the correct reference voltage for the SMC?\n\nConsidering 'white washing' the circuit to see whether that fixes the problem but given that each component tests OK individually with no signs of obvious damage I'm not sure it'll help...\n\nThanks guys!"

            "message": "Thank you for the reply 2informaticos \n\nYou've just answered my next question, I had been looking at those values on the schematic and wasn't quite sure how to interpret them! \n\nI'm fairly sure that the soldering isn't an issue, although I'm the first to admit that I'm not an expert, I'll check that tomorrow. I've also got some new U5400 ICs on order. \n\nSo if the voltage at pin 6 when it came in originally was around 0.2v (from memory it was something like 0.263v but I've slept since then!) it would have been closer to spec? If so, why would it be throwing the ASD error?\n\nThe only other concern that I have is that it may be an SMC issue, although logically the SMC is the output of the circuit so shouldn't be affecting the U5400 surely?\n\nDoes anyone have a working board they could take a reference voltage from so that I can have an idea of what sort of range I'm looking for? \n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nMany questions, I like to understand the bigger picture if possible, sorry!"
