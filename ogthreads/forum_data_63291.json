            "message": "I have a 820-00840 A that suffered water damage.  Was actually running, however after ultrasonic cleaning some caps literally lost the ends (Corrosion was making the contact).\n\n So, I have C8157 on a 820-00840 A. It calls for a 3.5PF 0201 25V.\n\n All I have in any of my sample books are 3.3PF 50V or 3.9PF  50V, skips right over 3.5PF.\n\n  Is it ok to use either ?  Is there a rule of thumb when you are so close to go higher or lower ?  Hate to wait 4-5 days for something so cheap.   I also checked and none of my donor boards seem to have a 3.5PF 0201 either. \n\n Thanks in advance !"
