            "message": "Hi,\n\nMy question was hard to search for because of all the backlight posts. I was wondering if anyone has had success in fixing a backlight issue on the actual LCD. I have a few A1466 MB AIR early 2014 LCD's laying around that the back light just went out. So many that I'm seeing a pattern here. I've just been replacing the whole assembly or getting just the lcd and replacing that so far but as this model gets older I'm finding the client is less likely to pay for the service even at a reasonable price compared to Apple. I seem to have so many of this year that I'm wondering if it was a known defect or if this particular LCD fails more often.\n\nJust trying to get my cost benefit ratio better for me and my customers and not send a bunch of shit into the recycling if it can last longer for them."

The 3 early 2014 that I have just had a backlight that went out on the actual display or LCD. Putting another LCD on them made them work. Unfortunately, for me and those 3 customers the cost to fix, even when I reduced my profit to half, was just not viable for them. So I was hoping there might be a \"known issue\" and a fix for the LCD. But trying to search that on google and any forum is like pulling teeth because all you get are vids of Rossmann :) showing how to fix it on the board. LOL\n\nI mean $50 bucks is $50 bucks but I don't think these 3 customers would have even done it if I made no money. Just how it is when devices get old and the price to repair them, even a reasonable price, doesn't seem worth it to the customer. It's not every customer but you know what I mean."
