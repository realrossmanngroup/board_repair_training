            "message": "So I have an 820-3437 board with no green/orange magsafe, but I have PP3V42, PPBUS_G3H is 8.18V and SMC_RESET_L is at 3.3V. There was corrosion on L5001 which resulted in loss of pads, had to run a wire to R5193, R5177 & R5178. Before I repaired traces I powered on board and got fan spin. After I get intermittent light but PPBUS is 8.18V. I checked SDA/SCL and they are at 3.3V. Is the next logical step to go after the SMC? I tried a gentle reflow but that didn't change anything. I'm wondering if I should just reball it."
