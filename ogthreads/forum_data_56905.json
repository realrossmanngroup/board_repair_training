            "message": "820-3482 A\n\nI got this machine after a client DIY disk swap attempt. The screen was damaged as well the lvds flat wich I allready replaced. Now the machine presents an issue that prevent the system to run quiet... Fan spins at full speed probably due to the sensors misrepresented temperature values which are as follows:\n\nAmbient 19?C\nAmbient 255?C\nLCD Proximity 128?C\nDisc 1 249?C\nDisc 2 129?C\n\nThose values reported from HWmonitor and could explain why the system sets the fan at high speed.\nConsider also that I replaced the SSD with the original HDD in order to exclude the disk variable from the equation...\n\nCould be a data line that involve those 4 sensors I don't know.\n\nAnybody knows where to look at for this sensors issue?"
