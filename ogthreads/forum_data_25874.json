That may have happened during removal, but I probably bumped the SMC too hard when trying to see if the solder had melted while placing it. The merged balls were: LPC_AD<0>, LPC_AD<2> and SMC_WAKE_SCI_L\n\nI grabbed another SMC from a donor board, reballed and placed that. Machine would now power on with quarter fan spin. Magsafe light slightly blinking. Every now and then it would go full fan spin, but no beep from speakers. Most of the time its just an endless loop of quarter fan spin.\n\nI first wanted to rule out having messed up the SMC again so decided to replace it yet again, just to see if the behaviour would be the same. This time there were no merged balls when lifting the SMC, and placing the next one went smooth. The board is acting the same as with the second SMC, so I'm assuming the problem is somewhere else. Might be because of the first SMC job, or because there is simply another issue with the board.\n\nSome measurements I took:\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.58V\nSMC_BCACOK = 3.27V\nSMC_RESET_L = 3.4V\nSMC_ONOFF_L = 3.45V\nSMC_LID = 3.4V\nL7510 = 0V\n\n[B]Resistance to ground because of the previously merged SMC balls:[/B]\nLPC_AD<0> to ground is about 230KOhm    \nLPC_AD<2> to ground is 7.18MOhm    \nSMC_WAKE_SCI_L to ground starts at 1k and goes up quickly"
