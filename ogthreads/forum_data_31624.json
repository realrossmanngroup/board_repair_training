Even though the three people I buy from are all sourcing from what I beleive is the same chinese guys, I think the extra cash is probably worth it for knowing they are good chips and not having to buy by the case which I cant afford. Middle man + PayPal keeps my peace of mind so I guess my pants are not being pulled down over the price really. In light of that, I've just ordered some 0001s.\n\nAs always, thank you for your reply Duke.\nAll the best."

Maybe VBIOS??\nChips are Samsung K4G20325FC-HC04 1GB\n\nI had to install R8610 to get the 005 to work at all.\n\nI can run FurMark and no issues. Use as normal without issues... ... Just, no problems at all.\nI have not bothered to find any sort of VRAM tester software. I don't think I really need to know too much, just stick a 0001 on there when they arrive.\nI only put the 005 on this one because it's my own machine."
