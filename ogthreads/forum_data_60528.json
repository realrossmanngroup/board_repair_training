            "message": "So I have an 820-2530 That is EFI Locked.  I tried to perform a PRAM reset but it will not do it. When I plug in an external KB it will respond to me hold option to see the EFI padlock, but any other key combos I get nothing. I hooked and External drive to it and can see usb activity, I also have a couple other 820-2530 boards that I put in to the case and the KB works. Would it be safe to assume U5701 is bad? I checked the pins up close on the KB connector and they appear solid. I just find it weird that even on an external KB it does not respond."
