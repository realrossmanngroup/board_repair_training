            "message": "Hi all,\n\nI need some assistance with a 820-01598-A. The board was left on the roof of the previous owners car and he drove off forgetting it was there and drove over it. I bought it off him and when I opened it up it was still running, no screen activity though probably because it was shattered and the keyboard desk is cracked on the sides. Tried to hold the power button but it would not respond so I had to disconnect the battery. I then plugged in my USB c meter and the board was drawing19.93V 0.0035a. I disconnected everything removed the board from the chassis and board by itself still pulling19.93V 0.0035a.\n\nI then Spoke to a friend of mine who asked me to check the following:\nUSB C meter: 14.779V 0.0143-173a. (Yes different to above.)\nPPBUS @ F7000 = 12.6V without battery.\nPPDCIN_G3H @ F3001 = 14.7 and steady not fluctuating. These were made with a 29w apple charger. I was then told to get a 98w apple charger and re measure which returned:\nUSB c meter: 20.568V @ 0.0372A. The protocol is listed as QC2.0 20V.\nPPBUS_G3H @ F7000 = 12.56V and steady.\nPPDCIN_G3H @ F3001 = 20.54V.\n\nI then went down the power sequence diagram and checked all the rails are present. Stupid me did not write them down but I think I got about half way down the list. I then left it for a while as I was going mad. I came back and prodded around the ISL. I sprayed some 99% IPA on it and the caps around it to see what gets hot and boom now I cannot get above 5V and ppbusg3h is now 300ma as is pp3v3_G3H_RTC. I\u2019ve checked those two rails and nothing seems shorted in the Kohm or Mohm range. I checked u6903 again no shorts in the Mohm range but 0v.I\u2019ve also noticed the USB c amp meter says Samsung protocol now not QC 2.0  like it use to. It\u2019s drawing 70-84ma at 5.168v but fluctuates. Lastly I hooked up the battery to see if that will change anything but still the same. It seems like the isl has crapped the bucket but wanted to get some advise before I go changing it. The fuses on both CD3217 show 5V. One thing I\u2019ve noticed now is whenever I put the USB c charger on the top port when the cpu side is facing upwards the USB c meter turns off so it seems like it\u2019s detecting a short and turning off. The second port it runs fine. This was not happening before.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the ISL though as it\u2019s not getting hot. The component on the flip side of the board in the same spot as the isl is slightly, very slightly. As are some of the large tants and u6390 but again only slightly it takes quite a few minutes for the ipa to evaporate so it\u2019s hard to tell if theres A short or if there just simply warming up because their on and working normally. Especially since whenever I try to measure something everything\u2019s in the Kohm or Mohm range.\n\nBTW: I have not tried DFU recovery. I do not have any working macs atm. I did try hook it up to a windows pc running iTunes but it did not detect anything not sure if it should. Also on the USB c meter I can occasionally get it to go up to 158ma so I do not think it\u2019s a dfu issue. This happens very rarely though, I have to reset the charger and 99% of the time when doing that it sits on 80 or so instead of 158. \n\nthanks for your assistance let me know if you need any further info."

            "message": "Doh sorry forgot that I should know better. Disconnected battery and the voltage on both sides for f7000 is 0.157. I\u2019ve been using the same charger since I bought the 98w. I did try the 29w when I first saw the 20v drop but it made no difference so I\u2019ve stuck with the 98w as I was told the a2159 won\u2019t turn on unless you use a 65w or greater.\n\nThere seems to be a short or open line I\u2019m more leaning to on the board or something because when I just went to measure both sides said 0. Had to go back and forth a few times than check the fuse next to the cd3217 which measured 5.16v to get the above reading. USB c meter never dropped sits on 5.16 and 70-87ma fluctuating so it\u2019s not a supply issue. \n\nWith the USB c meters for the protocol what should it say if the communication is working correctly? At first when I was getting the 20v it was saying QC2.0 but now it says Samsung.\n\nis it worth removing the T2 shield and doing a visual inspection? Considering this is crush damage it\u2019s likely a large bga has cracked solder balls which would explain the intermittent readings but no shorts showing. Only shield I\u2019ve removed so far is thunderbolt."

Don\u2019t want to do another charge case there 200 bucks here unless I find a used confirmed working one.\n\nif that does not solve it might have to mark this one no fix. When I poured ipa on the board at the start of this thread I noticed the board itself getting hot first, where there were no components so it looks like there may be a short internally. Though this was after applying power for a few minutes, normally internal board shorts run bloody hot this was more like luke warm at best."

Is that suppose to be a 0 ohm resistor or 2.7 ohm? The schematic on bad caps says 2.7 but the schematic from xin zhi zao says zero.\n\n I originally only had the one from xin zhi zao so when I measured it I saw 2.8k. Thought hmmm if that was blown it should be higher than that. Checked at other things couldn\u2019t find anything so I removed it. Now first boot was 5v 500ma than the USB meter reset and went to 20v 0.4744 amps and fluctuating slightly. If I use the second port towards the battery connector the meter turns off and stays off, so back to the earlier behaviour.\n\nPPBUS at F7000 is 12.53 volts so we\u2019re making progress finally! Looked around at a few other rails can\u2019t see any shorts anywhere. Which boards have replacements for R7191? According to my schematics the 8P, 6,XS, 3437 and 165 have zero of these on them which I find very hard to believe! And according to the schematic the 1598 has only r7191."

It fluctuates down slightly than back up to the above than after about 30 sec or so the amps drop to 0 and D+ drops down to 0.012 and dips down than back up. Protocol stays the same. D- dips to 0.01 and again the protocol stays the same. As mentioned above this is the exact behaviour I saw after replacing the 9240 but before removing r7191. Removing that finally gave me the 20v.
