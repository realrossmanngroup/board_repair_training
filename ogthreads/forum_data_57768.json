            "message": "Boot fine in safe mode but touchbar and backlight keyboard doesn't work (I assume it's normal bc of safe mode). With normal boot the macbook ask me for a critical uptade, tried with wifi, wired cable and I also tried what this guy say on a forum ([URL=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/309808/macbook-pro-2016-touch-bar-in-critical-update-loop\"]https://apple.stackexchange.com/ques...al-update-loop[/URL]). No liquid damage, I had some weird stuff around U4200 (picture attached), the rest of the board is nice, I cleaned this area but still have the problem. I tried with a known good Touchbar, a know good casing and keyboard, also with disconnected display, still have the problem of critical update. I tried to boot on an external SSD (same), I also tried clear ME Region.\n\nWith all this done, I think it's a board level problem and I have make some measurements on J4401 and J4402.\n\n[B]J4401[/B]\nPIN 10 DFR_DISP_INT = 0,05\nPIN 12 DFR_DISP_RESET_L = 0\nPIN 18 PP3v3_S0SW_DFR = 3,3V\n\n[B]J4402[/B]\nPIN 20 PP1V8_S0SW_DFR = 1,8\nPIN 19 DFR_TOUCH_ROM_WC = 0,04\nPIN 18 DFR_TOUCH_RESET_L = 1,8\nPIN 13 DFR_TOUCH_INT_L = 0,08\nPIN 9 DFR_TOUCH_SPI_CLK_R = 0,08\n\n[B]U4406[/B]\nPIN 4 DFR_DISP_SMC_RST_L = 3,42V\nPIN 2 DFR_DISP_RSDT_L = 0V\nPIN 6 PP1V8_S0 = 1,8V\nR4400 = 98K OK\nR4490 = 0,125MOhms NOK\n\nSo it's missing DFR_DISP_RESET_L and there is a strange value on R4490, it is a \"no stuff\" resistance and it should be 0ohms. Should I run a wire there ?"
