So the original broken has backlight and picture, then i replaced the new one, no BL no picture, put back the original, same no BL no picture, the same thing 3 times, and i think the last time what i did differently is the actually lift up the board to remove it from the battery, before i only pushed the battery disconnect button, im not sure if that fixed it but it seems like, what does that battery disconnect button do?"
