            "message": "[SIZE=12px]i have a 820-3332 that came in for no power, after diag realized its powering on fully just no internal display, checked smc_lid and realized it was 0, repaired and got screen for about 30 seconds, then black. figured out after a few seconds i lost [/SIZE]PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD_ISNS, so i jumped it from pin 2 to pin 5 of u9000 and no more loss of display after a few seconds, leading me to believe u9000 is bad, question is do i have to replace it, what harm will just jumping it do. i dont have a donor board for this board so if i have to replace it for some reason where can i get this chip?"
