It will not boot or charge.  Do I have bad I/O board?\nComing off the DC board I have 3.14v but when I connect it to the MB at J7000 I get a fluctuating voltage from 4v to 8v on pin 1.  Should I have more voltage coming from the I/O board.    I've tested every capacitor on the PPBUS_G3H for short but can't find one."

The low voltage means a short somewhere but just on the PP3V42?   I'll look at every cap and resistor on that line then or should I be focused on something else?"

Looks like it was on CHGR_SGATE_DIV and PPDCIN_G3H_INRUSH\n.  Well all I can say is that I was having an issue with PPBUS_G3H and that the computer would work on battery and not Charger so looks like I'll be looking into those two things above.  If anyone has some info to share please do."
