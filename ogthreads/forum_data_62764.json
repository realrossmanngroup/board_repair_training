            "message": "Hi,\n\ni have here a MacBook Pro 15\" 2009 with 820-2523-B that gets extremely hot. \n\nOf course I have already cleaned the vents and have replaced the thermal paste. With no improvement. I have also checked the heatsink with hot air and a thermal cam. It conducts heat normally.\n\nStill the MacBook gets burning hot. The App Macs Fan Control shows \"CPU Diode\" around 80 - 90\u00b0 C. The fans run at full speed at this temperature. The OS is a fresh install.\n\nWhat could be the reason?"

            "message": "I wanted to let it run to check how many minutes it takes to get hot. Unexpectedly it ran pretty normal for 30 minutes with CPU Diode around 70\u00b0C and fans at minimum.  After that I tried stressing the system with Unigine Valley, which uses both CPU and GPU. It did not get very hot during the benchmark, the fans ran only at 50% and after the benchmark was finished everything returned to normal quickly. I have no idea what happened, the problem seems gone. The day before it ran at more than 90\u00b0 and fans at full speed, even when performing basic tasks. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"
