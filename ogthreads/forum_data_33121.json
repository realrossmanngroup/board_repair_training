            "message": "820-4924-A. a Quarter of the display is white and No External Video(Tested with internal display connected and disconnected). Thunderbolt ports do nothing. HDMI port Causes the screen to flash on and off as if it is connecting and disconnecting from a display.\n\nNo Signs of Liquid Damage on board. Board was very dusty and looks like it had some sand on it. A tiny bit of what looks like a liquid residue on the top thunderbolt port. \n\nSame issues with good display. \n\nApple Hardware test passes no issues found. \n\nI'm lost on where to start with this. Any ideas?"
