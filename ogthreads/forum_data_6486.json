            "message": "Hi Guys\n\nI have this MacBook Pro 13-inch 2015 which came in with dead trackpad and dead keyboard. After switching trackpad cable the keyboard and trackpad came to life.\n\nBut the issue is now that it won't turn on by normal press on power button while on battery power. I need to keep the power button pushed for about 5-6 seconds to hear the chime. After this it starts and everything seems normal.\n\nIf the AC adapter is connected I can start by normal short press on the power button though.\n\nThe board has no liquid damage and customer says that keyboard and trackpad suddenly just stopped responding.\n\nAnyone have an idea to were to look?"
