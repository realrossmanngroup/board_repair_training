            "message": "hey there, I am not the greatest with USBC boards, and this issue in particular drives me nuts everytime.\nCurrently i have 2 boards showing this exact symptom:\nwhen charger is connected i get 5.17V (steady) on both ports, and 0Amps draw.\nPPBUS is missing (0V) and not shorted to ground, no shorted highside cpu mosfets.\nPP3V3_G3H is fine (3.34v) and reaches the pads under the CD3215s\nI get all LDO voltages on the CD3215s, except I don't get the PP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC rail.\n\nSo far on both boards i have tried reworking and replacing the U2890 and the USB redriver chip next to the ports as well as the ISL9239 (the latter more out of desperation)\nAlso replaced the CD3215s multiple times (always in pairs, and these boards need the C00 chips, so that's what i've used)\n\nIs a missing PP1V1 LDO caused by a bad CD3215, and am i just being extremely unlucky and keep putting bad CD3215s on the board?\nThere is only one cap on this LDO rail and that cap is fine (i.e. not shorted or no fucked pads)\n\nAm i missing something? I haven't posted a lot of measurements, i know, but i'm off work now till after the weekend, so can get back with more measurements.\n\nThanks in advance!"
