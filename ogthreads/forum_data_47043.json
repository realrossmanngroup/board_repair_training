            "message": "Client brought in device after device was liquid damaged. Noticed a build up of corrosion around U6903 which appears to be where PP3V3_G3H is created, and a blown Diode D6902.\n\nFirst thing I did was give device an ultrasonic cleaning to remove the corrosion to get a better look. After which, I replaced D6902 since it was severely blown. Images of before and after cleaning attached below. Device still would not boot, so I then applied alcohol around there area and injected 3V using a DCPS on to D6902 and discovered that C6906 was shorted. I have removed and replaced the shorted C6906, however device still does not boot.\n\nU7000 is sending 5V to PM_EN_P3V3_G3H to Pin 10 on U6903. (Is this voltage too high?)\nPin 2 on U6903 is being supplied 4.2V from D6902, however D6902 is being supplied 5.2V on PPDCIN_G3H.\nI believe U6903 is bad and is pulling down voltage.\nPin 9 on U6903 P3V3G3H_FB is outputting 0.66V,\nPin 3 on U6903 P3V3G3H_LX Is outputting 2.2V.\n\nUSB-C Ammeter reads 5.2V with .0A consumption. I applied some more alcohol around U6903 and injected 3V on PP3V3_G3H with a .05A Consumption. I am currently waiting for some replacement CD3215 to arrive, but until then, any suggestions on what else I should be looking for? If U6903 truly is bad, I found some replacements on DigiKey.com\n\nThank you in advance!"

However, if I remove R6923 at the end of this circuit, the circuit gets 3.4v on Pin 1 of R6923. My thought process is that there is something pulling down voltage on Pin 2 of R6923. I then injected 3.3v into Pin 2 of R6923 which pulled at .015Amps and measured with Multi meter around  all CD3215 which all received 3.3v.  I am now stumped and do not know where I should be looking."

My thoughts are something is definitely pulling down your 3v3 line like you said possibly a CD3215 chip OR seeing where your liquid was it could even be the ISL9239. Voltage present at pin 10 of U6903 with a good R6923 on the board?"
