            "message": "Hello,\n\nThe board originally came in for no power. It had a short in the PCB on PPBUS_G3h near J6430 caused by liquid damage. That was cleaned and the short in the PCB was cleared, now the Macbook turns on and boots but the fans run at full speed and runs slow. I ran HWmonitor and the only thing that stands out is the Airport temp sensor but that seems to be normal. All the other temps read fine, nothing stands out. I've tried another keyboard assembly with a known good track and also tried the board without the LCD plugged it as well as tried it with a known working LCD. \n\nAlthough the areas looked good I also changed U5850, U5860 and U5870 but there wasn't any change. All the chips are being power, the resistors in their circuits tested good, and nothing stands out with the caps or traces as well.\n\nAny suggestions or help would be appreciative. Thanks."
