            "message": "Welcome to my nightmare...\n\nGot an 820-3476-A that was liquid damaged. After cleaning ultrasonically I replaced the following by looking for any burnt pins/what looked bad to get a fan spin:\n\nReplaced U1950 (PM_PCH_PWROK was all over the place) and replaced C1950 which was burnt\nReplaced R7202 which was burnt then U7200 as a precaution.\nRemoved J6100 and cleaned up the pins, main one that was burnt was pin 30 (SMC_TMS)\nThere were also some red burn marks on the traces for LPC_CLK24M_SMC and SMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN but the traces are OK. Replaced SMC as a precaution.\n\nNow fan spins, I get all main power rails, I get a light on a USB mouse when plugged in but no video/POST. CPU gets warm after a while but not mega hot. Fan spins from normal then up to maximum.\n\nI get 0V on SPI_MLB_MOSI and SPL_MLB_CLK\nI get 3.3V on SPIROM_HOLD_L which comes from SPIROM_USE_MLB which I think means the BIOS is stuck in programming mode from reading about this issue?\n\nHave swapped over U6100 - no change.\n\nAny ideas what to check next? So annoying to be close to figuring this hellish board out.\n\nBoard readings as follows:\n\nPPBUS_G3H 12.61 V\nPP3V42_G3H 3.418 V\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.347 V\nPP5V_S5 5.15 V\nPP5V_S4 5.15 V\nPP5V_S0 5.14 V\nPP3V3_S5 3.349 V\nPP3V3_S4 3.347 V\nPP3V3_SUS 3.345 V\nPP3V3_S3 3.347 V\nPP3V3_S0 3.342 V\nPP5V_S0_FET 5.14 V\nPP3V3_S0_FET 3.343 V\nPP1V35_S3_CPUDDR 1.356 V\nPP1V35_S3 1.357 V\nPP0V675_S0_DDRVTT 0.674 V\nPPVTTDDR_S3 0.68 V\nPP1V05_SUS 1.045 V\nPP1V5_S0 1.515 V\nPP1V05_S0 1.041 V\nPP1V05_S0SW_PCH_HSIO 1.043 V\nPPVCC_S0_CPU 1.745 V\n\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN 3.384 V\nSMC_PM_G2_EN 3.414 V\nSMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN 0 V\nPM_SLP_S5_L 3.346 V\nPM_SLP_S4_L 3.344 V\nPM_SLP_S3_L 3.345 V\n\nSPI_MLB_CS_L 3.349 V\nSPI_MLB_MISO 3.341 V\nSPIROM_WP_L 3.347 V\nSPI_MLB_MOSI 0 V\nSPI_MLB_CLK 0 V\nSPIROM_HOLD_L 3.31 V\nSPIROM_USE_MLB 3.31 V\n\nLPC_CLK24M_SMC 1.704 V\n\n\nThanks,\n\nJon"

Thanks :)\n\nNo HDMI output on IO board but USB mouse lights up from there as well. Don't own a displayport-vga unfortunately tried a displayport-dvi but still nothing. When trying to boot from a drive that has only 3S162 EFI I get nothing and no power/activity lights on USB stick I'm trying to boot off. USB mouse lights up fine even after pulling out and plugging in again.\n\nSMC_TMS, TDO, TDI and TCK all high at 3.4V, although I don't really know what that means.\n\nI read somewhere on the advancedreworks forum that SPIROM_USE_MLB should be 0V or SPI reset is done - is that true or BS as I get 3.3V for that?\n\nShould I be more concerned about missing the following BIOS voltages?\n\nSPI_MLB_MOSI 0 V\nSPI_MLB_CLK 0 V\n\nThey're all present when BIOS removed and all resistors look good which would indicate to me bad U6100? Have a third replacement on its way just in case\n\nCurrent skill level = repair monkey. A far better and more accurate description than 'junior member'\n\nAny further ideas before I heatgun my own face out of frustration (gotta heatgun something right?)"
