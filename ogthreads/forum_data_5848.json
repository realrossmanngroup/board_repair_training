I have decided that my screen was just bad, and it was by chance that it burnt out as I was checking it out... works on a known good... fair enough.  My problem is the Track Pad does not work, Have plugged in a new one, doesnt work. External works fine, internal old and internal new dont.  I looked at as much of the circuit as I could, but everything seemed to check out. In fact 3.3 V is coming in at P1 and 5V on Pin 4 at J4800, anyone have any idea? I am so tired of this board.  Also, the TBT circuitry is non-op... Does this matter? All other functions except TPad work... Any Suggestions?"

My first hint should've been the semi-melted wifi/camera/lvds cable, plastic cover. \n\nI am getting voltage on those two pins, wouldn't that indicate continuity? Any idea what could cause the higher voltage drop on pins 3 & 5?\nChecking around u4801, would I just look for continuity with the connector pins?"
