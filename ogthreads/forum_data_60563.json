After inspecting board there was some corrosion near C6201 and Q7800. Looks like there was liquid around J6950.\n\nI tried injecting 3V at pin 2 of L7260 but given not full short nothing getting warm. I tried pulling J2550.\n\nAny suggestions on tracking this down? :-/"

Replacing that from known good 3209 (bad ram) board brought the board back to life and now starts but then stops. PPBUS_G3H is at 8.4V.\n\nSMC bypass keeps it running so I went through the VSense and ISense measurements. None of the VSense  measure over 1V. Not really getting anything to register anything notable on the iSense lines. PLT RESET L is 3.3V during smc bypass, it comes on momentarily with normal power on."

I can only assume that the board with what used to be intermittent RAM issue that I was using for reference has another issue. What are the chances of both having same bad reading...\n\nAnyway thanks for the help. I'll report back if I can't finish this one up."
