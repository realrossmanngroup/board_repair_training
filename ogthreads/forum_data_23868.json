We even tried connecting the Macbook Pro to an external screen and still we are getting a white screen.  Tried booting with an external hard drive. No Results.  Pressed CMD + R to see if it takes us to the recovery mode, but nothing.  All it gives is a White Screen.  Could you please advice any troubleshooting steps. Raj."
