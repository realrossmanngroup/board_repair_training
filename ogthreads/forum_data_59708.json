Upon removing the several wires that are involved in the bypass, I was able to reprogram the gMux using DosDude's firmware update but now the display is not showing a backlight.\n\nLooked at BKL_PWM fail and I've checked R9704 is 33ohms, R9693 is 100k ohms, C9704 is not shorted to ground.\n\nAlso checked Pin 2 on U9701 (LP8550) that enable is 3.3V\n\nBKL_PWM is only 8.8 mV, so I hard wired BKL_PWM to 3.3V and still no backlight\n\nAlso checked Output on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is only set to 12.5v,\n\nI've reballed U9701 hoping to resolve some poor connection on the pads but no difference, should I assume the Backlight IC is toast?"
