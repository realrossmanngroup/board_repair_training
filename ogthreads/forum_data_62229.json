            "message": "Hello guys,\n\nMy MacBook Pro died after cycling the battery using [URL='https://apphousekitchen.com/']Al dente[/URL]. I been using aldente for years to keep my battery at 80% with great success but after upgrading to the PRO version, I decided to try the Cycling feature. It suppose to discharge the battery to 15%, charge it up to 100%, repeat, etc... Whoever it passed  down the 15% mark, which I noticed around 3%, I tried to cancel it, so the charger will be enabled again and start charging but it didn't work. As expected the computer shut off, but because the battery is so dead (and old) and the SMC is commanded to disabled the charger to power it (and charge) it is stuck dead. I can't restart the SMC.. The computer was working 100% fine. \n\nSo I opened it up and I successfully recharge the battery externally, but when putting it back I accidently shorted batt+ with ground and I believe the bat management is dead (I know, it was stupid mistake, but I work with Lithium-ions so I know how to work with them as long as I don't short them). So I bought a new battery and I will try that as soon as it arrives, whoever, I just started to study the diagrams and schematics. There is a small possibility I might have damaged the board, but I don't think so, the short was from the battery + to the battery ground... \n\nRepairing unknown electronics is whole different story, but it seems pretty straight forward. I need some help so I can restore the SMC and check if something else is not damaged. All I need to do is recover some files no matter what, even If I need to destroy it. If successful I'm willing to donate it for parts.  \n\nSo far, the USB charger is stuck at 5V. I don't see I2C, which is bad. I believe the T2 is bricked. I been randomly checking voltages, but I didn't write them down, until the very end: \n\nPPDCIN_G3H = 5.1V\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.32V\n\nMore info: The motherboard looks very nice, no corrosion, no water spills, no water detectors triggered. Just a lot of dust. Not hot spots, the hottest part besides you guys is around the USB-C management chips at around 35C. The motherboard does nothing if I press the power button, button works I see is pulling the 3.3V line down. I'm waiting for the USB-C power meter to provide better details. \n\nQuestions:  \n\n1.- Seems like all the capacitors from the U7800 bucks are sorted, is that normal? It is a switched regulator, so it might be but is strange. PP3V3_G3H_SOCPMU has ~3.4V, so supply to the IC is good. \n2.- It would be wise to follow this voltages in order? But is from a different laptop, so not all names match: [URL='https://logi.wiki/images/8/86/820-01055_Power_Sequence.pdf']Here[/URL]\n3.-What power rails and regs should be alive when the laptop is at S5? \n\nI'm looking for suggestions to verify that the hardware is good, and try  to force/restore the T2, maybe via the DFU, and recover the files or whatever suggestions you have. Thanks!\n\n[You can skip this part]\nI'm an engineer, I do complex PCB designs, RF, I rework BGAs, reball them, manually solder 01005 components, etc... Is part of my daily job. I work in company that designs and assembles electronics, whoever I don't have experience repairing laptops. I have access to all the tools, even x-ray."
