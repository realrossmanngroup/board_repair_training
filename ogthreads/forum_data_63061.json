            "message": "This computer acts like the power button is being held down, but the power button is not held down at all. The power button actually does not even work. I hold it down to power the computer off, but it does nothing. I have tried disconnecting the power button to see if this does anything different and it does not. I have already tried formatting with disk utility, showing all devices too, formatting each. This still is not working. Big Sur (one of the default images) seems to install fine, but it just keeps boot looping after the install after it restarts. If I try to choose another boot disk (boot to the hard drive) I get the pictured error. I have even installed Monterey on a USB drive and the install went fine but again, it keeps boot looping in to recovery mode. I do not see any damage under the scope to the logic board. The customer that brought it in thought that there may have been some update being done and it never finished but she was not certain. I need some help with this one please."

Before I could have sworn that I was pulling 20v. Anyhow I placed the board back in the mac, hooked up the main things like screen, battery, trackpad, and I opened the computer, the computer actually booted up and went right back to the same screen. Maybe we are just not getting enough power for some reason. I have never seen a computer boot with only 5v. I guess I should look next at the CD3215 boot up sequence?"
