I did several screen replacement on older Macbooks, but never on one from 2020.\nMy question: on these models, are the screens \"paired\", and there is a need to update a software after the replacement, or is it enough to unscrew and unplug/plug, as in former Macbooks?\nWill a screen from Aliexpress do the trick?"
