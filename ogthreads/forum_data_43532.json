            "message": "came with a blown DCIN fuse which is already a joke to see. Also short circuit on mains on the MagSafe board. After Fuse/Charging board replacement i got a fan spin and full choo-choo with a new battery.\nOn my bench. After full assembly, i put it on outcome desk and plugged in an original known-good Magsafe 60w charger which is perfectly compatible with 2012 mid 13' A1278. No light, no charge, DCIN cycles on the charger (did not know board can do that, but okay though). Works with a 45w china crap-charger works with my bench cable which is probably also a crap cable.\n\n\nSOLUTION:\nthanks to 2informaticos: Q7080 reverse current protection circuit MosFeT: short-circuit between drain and gate. The original power brick is smart enough to cut down the power, bench PSU gives zero shits about reverse current."
