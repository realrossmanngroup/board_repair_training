Will not start in SMC bypass mode, or after SMC reset - I've never seen it running. I tried to flash the BIOS chip with known good one (with clean ME) for 820-3330, but nothing changed (so I flashed back the old one). There were no signs of spills, oxidation or previous repairs. It looks to me like dead CPU? I've got one CPU for 820-3330 on stock, so I can change it, but I'm not sure if it's really dead when it still beeps without RAM... Also why would it die? The chip itself looks OK, like everything else on the motherboard.\n\n\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU 1.11V\nPPVCORE_GPU 0.90V\nPPVCORE_S0_AXG 0V\n\nPP3V42_G3H\nPPBUS_G3H 12.53V\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.33V\n\nPP5V_S5 5.05V\nPP5V_S3 5.05V\nPP5V_S0 5.04V\nPP3V3_S5 3.33V\nPP3V3_S3 3.33V\nPP3V3_S0 3.33V\nPP1V5_S3 1.50V\nPP1V2_S0 1.20V\nPP1V05_S0 1.03V\nPP0V75_S0_DDRVTT 0.74V\n\nLCD_PWR_EN 0.00V\nDP_MUX_EN 1.00V\nCPU_PWRGD 1.02V\nSMC_RESET_L 3.10V\nALL_SYS_PWRGD 3.29V\nPM_SLP_S4_L 3.33V\nSMC_LID 3.09V\n\nSMC_CLK32K present\nSYSCLK_CLK32K_RTC present\n\nThank you"

After changing U7400 the CPU_VCORE came back, but that's all. \n\nIt beeps even with different BIOS, I tried one downloaded BIOS for 820-3330 and one from a known working 820-3330 board - still the same. Without RAM it's just one long beep that repeats after a few seconds. \n\nI tried all possible configurations of RAM and about 4 different tested working pairs with different frequencies (12800, 10600, L, non-L...), but it's always the same - with any RAM in any slot it's quiet, without RAM it beeps."
