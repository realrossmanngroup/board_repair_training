Was able to verify that all major power rails are pulsing but present at correct values and PLT_Reset)_L pulses also. \n\nResoldered U8900 just in case. Tried new BIOS and CLeanME with no change. Liquid indicator was triggered on battery connector but board looks good - a little noticeable residue near the keyboard connector. SMC bypass gets a bit of fan spin but no start.\n\nThinking maybe GPU bypass, Flux and heat CPU or USC the board... Other thoughts?"

Board now boots so should be good to go."
