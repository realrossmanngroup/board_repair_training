Medusa couldn't read chip so pulled J6100 - no change. Wasn't able to clean me yet being Medusa didn't work but I'm thinking this means possibility of spi trace broken... I havent seen that personally, but know not uncommon for this board. Do the traces usually break from one side to the other side? I was able to verify connections to nearby resistors on the U6100 side."
