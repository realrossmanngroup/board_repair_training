So no light on charger. After repairing u7090 the charger is very dim for a second only. \nSo I tested for shorts on ppbus g3h. Can't find any. \nHave traced it back to u7100, CHGR_CSO_P and CHGR_CSO_N are non existent.\n\nSo I have come to the conclusion that U7100 is dead. Have I missed any checks? Thanks."

Really really wish I was in the states and could go sit with Louis or Jessa for however bloody long it takes..\n\nAnyway can I ask this then. At L7095 or even C7095 I should be able to find me PP3V42. But I can't. I see 1.2v only.\n\nU7090 is getting 16v on pin 6 VIN.\nD7005 is showing 16v pin 2 and pin 3. Pin 1 is under 1v but that's because there is no battery??? (Praying I read that right)..\n\nso what im asking is could U7090 be the culprit then?\n\nThanks duke. Any other subtle pointers you have would be highly appreciated!\nThanks."
