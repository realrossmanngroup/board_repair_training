            "message": "This 820-3115 had waterdamage and wont start. I cleaned that and now it only starts if there is no monitor attached to it (internal and external). It i plug any monitor in fan just twitch once every time i press the power button. Without a screen it chimes but turns off after ~20 seconds. It beeps without ram and also stays on beeping forewer without ram (not turning off like it does with ram - i tested every combination of the two sticks in both slots and also one of mine - everytime with the same result.). If i \"trick\" it by starting it and instantly plugging in a external monitor after it chimed it shows a white screen but turns off same way as if there is no screen at all. I tested a known good LCD and it still wont start with the LCD connected. I measured all Pins of J9000 in diode mode and compared it betreen screen plugged in, screen unplugged and  a working board (with screen plugged in and also unplugged) and i cant find any differences. So i am stuck."

            "message": "As i want to disable thunderbold i want to check the voltage that U3890 prodces before i remove R3881 and after to make sure TBT is disabled. I measured without LCD and there are just 2,5 V at D3890 (both sides - diode mode measurement > 0,5 V at both sides - no short). That should be 12.6 V (if not boosting) or 0 V if i am right. Also i would expect it to be 0 V with R3881 removed. With R3881 back in place i get 12,6 V at the top of the voltage divider, 8,4 V at TBT_div_L and ~6 V at Pin 2 of R3881 (i expected that to be 0 V). So i came to Q3805 and the enable is 0 V. To be sure i am not out of mind here i removed Q3880 (as you suggested) and i still get 2,5 V at PPVIN_SW_T29BST and i cant understand where that voltage is coming from... But also with Q3881 removed board wont start with lcd plugged in...\nAlso i wrote down all parts that had corrosion on them as i got the board. Heres the list maybe that helps.\n\n\nU3890\nQ5480\nU4900\nR2570\nD9498\nU7542\nU4582\nU5701\nU7200\n\n\nU3890 is one of them. The corrosion was in the area of pins 1-10... R3889 and the traces to U3890 are fine."
