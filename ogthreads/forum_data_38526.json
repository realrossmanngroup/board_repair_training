I replaced a bunch of corroded components, repaired some traces, and I'm getting a fan spin, but no chime, no display, no boot.\n\nI have all rails present, including VCORE, but the CPU doesn't heat up at all.\n\nI assume I'm looking at a dead CPU here? Or is there something else I might have overlooked?\n\nThanks in advance,\nBruce"
