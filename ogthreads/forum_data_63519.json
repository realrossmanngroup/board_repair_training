            "message": "Dear community,\n\nI received an A2141 for no power. I found some issues while scanning through the microscope and also while measuring.\nCB300 was short\nUB300 was suspect\nUB400 was suspect\nL3500 was liquid damaged\nC9503 was ripped, including one of its pads.\n\nAfter both UB300 and UB400 were replaced the device turned on again, but didn't take a charge from the USB-C power adapter. I tried several power adapters with sufficient watts.\n\nAt [URL]https://repair.wiki/w/A2141_2019_16%22_MacBook_Pro[/URL] I looked at the \"No Power. No life on USB-C amp meter, or 5V ~ 0A.\" symptom and did find 3.3V on  PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X and 12V at C6961. I was not sure how to check enable signal. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I should've checked any of these, because I have no clue where the problem originates.\n\nI do have the schematics and the boardview so I can find what you point me at, though I must emphasise that I am absolutely a junior board repairder and might ask follow-up questions which might seem pretty novice. I can measure every pin of every component you might need more info from when I can find it on the boardview.\n\nI await your reply.\n\nRegards,\nJelle"

I used the original power adapter and a spare one which can deliver more.\n\nI measured UPC_I2C_INT_L on pin 7 of J3000 and it reads 5.5mV. I expect that to be low and 3.3V or 5V to be high?\n\nEdit: the above is measured with the battery disconnected and the original power adapter connected."
