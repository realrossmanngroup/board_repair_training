            "message": "Hello. Got this one from another store and who knows what have been done to it. U3200 was bad and so were C3508 and C3509 and board was obviously not negotiating 20V. When I plugged in charger it sucked 1.5Amps from charger and immediately shut down in loop. Replaced those components and now I get 20V on charger. PP5V_S5 is jumping up and down like hell and so is PP3V3_S5. I get little pulsing on L8000 like if the board is trying to turn on. I have no shorts that I could find on big coils. Tried replacing U7650 but no luck. Any hints?"

Gave a nice reflow on all CD3215 and board worked again. Working for 3 days now without a single issue. Will test it for some more time before giving it back to costumer."
