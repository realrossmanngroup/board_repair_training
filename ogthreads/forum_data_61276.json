            "message": "Hi guys. I have a 2017 Macbook Air 820-00165 that came in with very minor liquid damage around the backlight driver. I checked the rest of the board very carefully as a matter of routine anyway, Otherwise it worked from what I could tell- image was there, backlight was not. Replaced backlight driver (I have done many and yes, it is on the correct way around and yes, I used a new driver). Now board turns on,, fan spins, no chime, runs at around 350 to 500ma (varies), shuts off once, restarts then runs (still no chime), ends up around 550 to 600ma., no image or backlight. No activity at USB ports.\n\nChecked my work obviously, re-did it anyway just to be sure. No actual damage there anyway, just the backlight chip was dead.\n\nALL power rails are fine as in I get all the power rails. All-Sys_PWRGD is there also. Machine runs, fan spins, just no actual CPU activity. CPU gets warm/hot as in normal temp. \n\nANY pointers would be very appreciated."

PLT-Reset will be my first check. I know a bit about these boards, but am fairly new to Macs so bear with me if I don't get just how they should power on as in sequence. I will guess that PLT is to dor with the PCH, so makes sense to look into that.\n\nAgain, by SPI terminations, I presume you mean the resistors around the U6100? Or am I just guessing wrong there?  I did remove, clean and refit the U6100 already as I thought the erorr may be the bios, but again, I need guidance here and appreciate your help very much."

New day.\n\nI checked all SPI termination resisters and every one is correct.\n\nI checked the J6100 (apologies, I was tired yesterday) and it too is spotless and new looking/fine. I have not removed it as I want to program through it later and have not yet mastered the art of what temperature will remove one without melting the plastic. Maybe you could advise?\n\nYou were correct with PLT_RESET_L . It is 3.3v. This is where these things can play with your mind. Correct me if I am wrong, but the fact it is L means it should be 0v (as in grounded). It is currently not and thus 3.3v is incorrect?\n\nThe resister R2071 is 65ohm (in circuit) which should be 0ohm. I have replaced that with a new 0ohm resister and get the following at U2071:\nPin 1 = 3.3v\nPin 2 = 3.3v\nPin 3 = 0v\nPin 4 = 3.3v\nPin 5 = 3.3v\n\nYou have helped a lot so far. Any ideas from here? I guess  PLT_RESET_L  should be 0v, so my guess is I need to find out what SHOULD be sending that to ground. But please tell em if that is correct?"

But sometimes it is better to ask and then know. \n\nThe BIOS on this WAS good as in the machine did run - just the backlight that did not work and also the charger light. That light has come on, then not come on with this DC-in board and others, so needs a bit more looking at, but would not stop the machine running I would'nt have thought. It is currently coming on green then amber. If I have another identical BIOS  I will swap it, but I think the others I have are from 820-3437 boards.\n\nOne thing to ask as I cannot remember. I know that 3437 boards do the 3 starts. Unless I am wrong, 00165 just starts doesn't it? This one starts, runs a bit then shuts down and restarts but only the once. By that I mean it does that every time I apply power, but just the singe restart and not 2 restarts like a 3437.\n\nIs there a way to tell for certain if the PCH is running? The CPU (as in the heat sink) gets hot (normal hot, not hot-hot). It is as if the lights are on but nobody is home with this board."
