Tried known good DC in board and 85 watt no change. Q7080 has 18 volts on pins 1-3 and 4, so I assumed that might be the problem and replaced it. Still no change 18 volts on both gate and source. What do I check next? R7080 and R7081 measure correctly. This one I've been messing with for like 3 days so need help badly lol."
