I have backed up the data successfully, I am not able to boot to an external drive the screen just goes black, same thing for recovery or anything else other than holding down the option key or successfully booting very slowly to the internal drive normally.

I\u2019m not exactly sure what the T-CON board is I feel like this is it from what I gather. I tried a cracked display to see if it would change anything except the two cracked displays I have are insanely cracked so it\u2019s very hard to tell actually more like I see the Apple jumping around on the bottom for what appeared to be very very long, I\u2019m not confident that this is a good test so I would like to do what you\u2019re saying with disconnecting the webcam which I\u2019m having trouble figuring out exactly what it would be I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of the flexes right? Maybe? Unless I\u2019m wrong so I used the cracked screen as a test to make sure that I could remove the shields without damaging the flexes, if I have to remove the flex I certainly will. But I would like to know that I\u2019m properly doing what you suggest. I guess that\u2019s a long way of saying, What is the T-CON board and which is the webcam?[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60204[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60205[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60206[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60207[/ATTACH]"

Everything related to the keyboard and trackpad appear to work as expected.\nI realized I forgot to mention at the start of everything I did have to swap the headphone Jack board (820-01992-0) with the exact same board and corresponding flex; as the original had fried the connector on the board/flex on part of it, the whole thing looked kinda bad so I chose to replace it (not sure if this is helpful info).\nAlso I guess I did most of my work here with the battery disconnected and became so engulfed in the temp and slowness, I missed that the battery says \u201cservice battery\u201d and that it\u2019s not charging (it does recognize the battery and shows the lightning bolt)  idk if this maybe solely the battery or if it\u2019s related to the issue we\u2019ve been troubleshooting or it\u2019s own separate issue. I\u2019ll order a battery but don\u2019t know if this is necessary to continue troubleshooting the issue at hand."
