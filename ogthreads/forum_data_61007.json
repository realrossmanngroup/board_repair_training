On USB metter I get 19.4V and 0.59A without battery.\nIt seams to power on (I hear the \"little Chime\") but get no image. I have tried with two different LCD, but without success. Tried an external monitor, but same behavier.\n\nCan you help?"

The amperage drops to arround 0.35A after a few seconds, and vcore also drops a bit to around 0.6V (I thought that the inicial amperage / voltage were the most important, and didn't realize that you asked the final voltage of vcore.
