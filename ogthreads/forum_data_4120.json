            "message": "Hey guys, just diving in to board level laptop repairs here, I purchased a dead water damaged Macbook Air and also this Retina 13in to begin my learning quest. Macbook Air was repaired after hours and hours of watching Louis's videos which I'm absolutely stoked about! Thanks Louis! But now this 820-3476 board is giving me issues. So I'm here to get some pointers hopefully..\n\nFirstly the laptop would not power, no orange, no green lights. Dead in every aspect. Found some minor corrosion around C7050 and C7060. Replaced C7060 and cleaned the rest in the ultrasonic. Now I have orange and green lights and the fans spin so I reassembled into laptop.\n\nAlthough I get the orange light and fans come on I still get no chime and nothing on the screen. After a couple mins the fan starts going extreme.\n\nI then started measuring power rails, everything is present.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on where I should start looking now? I feel like I was making progress in my learning here but have hit a pretty big wall and am stumped basically.\n\nGoing to study the way the LCD works over lunch and see if that can give me some insight otherwise any pushes in the right direction would be lovely!\n\nThanks\nRob"

No there is no question mark folder (LCD doesn't seem to even show a backlight) and when I plug in a USB mouse it lights up for half a second.\n\nI have started from scratch again, testing the one wire circuit and power rails. Now please correct me if I'm wrong or if my thinking is way off track. I think my learning curve is just starting to rise now..\n\nU7090 Pin 6 vin should be 3.42v right? It gets it from D7005 which has 14.5v on pin 1, pin 2 and pin 3, the 3 resistors C7092 C7091 C7090 all make sure U7090 gets the correct 3.42v?\n\nMy VIN on PIN 6 of U7090 is still the 14.5v measured from D7005. So do I have a part that isn't pulling the voltage down to 3.42v? Is D7005 not doing its job?"
