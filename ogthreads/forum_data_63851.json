            "message": "Hi,\n\nMy wife's 2019 MBP died a couple of weeks ago and I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with it. I took it to Apple who diagnosed a logic board failure and quoted me around \u00a3700 to replace even though it's just a few months outside AppleCare warranty... I have an electronics background and equipment (microscope, hot air, soldering iron, oscilloscope etc) but never tried to diagnose a modern MBP before. I have the board view and schematics already and have been climbing the learning curve steadily! [IMG]https://www.badcaps.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif[/IMG]\n\nInitial fault was no power with USB ammeter showing 5.19V @ around 12 to 35ma. I won't go into all the initial debug I did because ultimately I found R7900 to be high resistance when it should have been a 0ohm link. I'm using a genuine 96w Apple charger and cable which works fine on other MacBook Pros. The logic board is fully extracted from the chassis with USB-C sockets attached.\n\nSo, going from the power sequence chart in the schematics I get:\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.29V\nPPBUS_HS_GPU = 12.29V\nPP3V3_G3H_SSD0_SNS = 3.38V\nPP3V3_G3H_T = 0.02V (this led to R7900 being diagnosed as o/c)\n\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC_X is also 3.38V which feeds the upstream side of R7900.\n\nI linked out R7900 with some wire wrap for now and that now causes the USB ammeter to power up and shut down continually and I can't get a reading. I measured PPBUS_G3H with my oscilloscope and the voltage is ramping up from 3.7v to 12.6v over the space of 170ms and then sustaining 12.6v for 70ms before dropping rapidly to 3.7v again.\n\nI tried removing the R7900 bridge and injecting voltage to the PP3V3_G3H_PMU_VINRTC_R line which R7900 feeds and it takes 3.65A at 3.3V. I only ran at this level for a second because the U7800 Power IC starts to warm up even at 2A current draw at 2.65V injected. When injecting power I didn't see any voltage on the U7800 outputs.\n\nI checked the T2 power rails as per logi.wiki and got the following. Took resistance measurement plus diode mode in brackets (red lead on ground):\n\nPPVDDCPU_AWAKE = 15.9ohm (0.021)\nPP0V82_SLPDDR = 34.5ohm (0.032)\nPPVDDCPUSRAM_AWAKE = 212ohm (0.637)\nPP1V1_SLPS2R = 7.8kohm (0.402)\nPP0V9_SLPDDR = 57.3ohm (0.054)\nPP1V8_SLPS2R = >20kohm (0.390)\n\nGeneral observations - no signs of liquid damage and no corrosion. U7800 has a somewhat \"mottled\" appearance under the microscope but no signs of burns. The PPGFX_S0_GPU line is very low resistance around 1.6ohm but not sure if this is normal. \n\nSo, my guess is that U7800 is faulty but I'd appreciate a second opinion. I have a Quick 861DQ hot air station and Hakko FX-888D solder station and have some experience at using hot air but would appreciate nozzle size, airflow and temperature guidance for removing U7800. I would also appreciate any help in finding a source of a new or used/reballed chip. It says it's a 338S00267-A0 (1939PHGU) but I don't know if these are generic or specific to each individual MBP model.\n\nLooks like the A1989 (820-00850) U7800 chip might be the same. From a quick check of the respective schematics, the BOM details are the same and the pin assignments seem to be the same from what I've checked so far (mostly the LDO section). Even the neighbouring passive components have the same designations and values. I also checked A2159 (820-01598) but it has a different U7800 chip with part number 338S00466 which has different pin assignments, and from checking a BGA stencil from see-ic on eBay, this chip has a different stencil to the 338S00267. The stencils are both 18x18 (324) pins but the pitch on the 466 is very slightly larger than the 267 it seems.\n\nI'd really appreciate any help you can offer.\n\nMany thanks,\nCraig."

            "message": "Hi, thanks for the welcome, and for the fast response.\n\nDiode mode readings for R7900 (I presume you meant that and not R9700) are 0.417 (red lead on ground) and 0.753 (black lead on ground). This is with my link wire still attached between R7900 pin 1 and 2. Do you want me to do the same readings with the link removed?\n\nThis reading seems okay to me but I don't have a good board to compare against. I wondered if it was an output from the PMU that was shorted but I tried checking all the inductors to ground in diode mode and couldn't find any obvious shorts. When I said the PMU was getting hot, I didn't let it get \"ouch!\" hot but it was certainly warming up once more than 1.5A was flowing into it. \n\nYou mention the PMU's internal firmware - is this coded on the PMU itself or does it come via an external ROM?\n\nI have ordered a BGA reball kit with a clamp, a selection of solder balls and universal stencils which should be here tomorrow. I've also bought an 820-01041 board from eBay as a potential donor. The board has already had NAND removed so was quite cheap and appears to still have the PMU installed so I'll give it a try. I can hopefully also salvage R7900 from it to replace it properly and any other passives.\n\nNo worries about the hot air advice, I understand. I'll practice on the donor board before attempting the PMU swap.\nThanks again."

I inspected the solder balls along one edge of U7800 and it was clearly not melted so I did a reflow at a higher temperature with more flux added.\n\nIt took a lot of heat and honestly I'm not 100% sure if I did it correctly without damaging the chip but after cooling I tested it again and I get the exact same symptoms I had before I replaced the chip. My ammeter is cycling and never gets to show a voltage or current, and my LDO outputs show no voltage except for LDO3 which briefly pulses up to 160mV or so on the multimeter each time the USB-C ammeter cycles. I still get 12.29V on PPBUS.\n\nAs I mentioned, I used the new PMU chip rather than the one from the donor board but I have extracted the one from the donor board and have manually reballed it with leaded solder balls and could try installing it. But before I do that, I wanted to update you and ask how likely it is to have the exact same symptoms after a PMU replacement? If I installed it badly or overheated the chip during installation, would it show the same symptoms as before?\n\nMany thanks,\nCraig."

The balls on the top edge now look like they have settled down and flowed and the chip is closer to the PCB surface. But I fear that repeated heating may have destroyed the chip. In particular, prolonged heating at temperatures just not quite hot enough to flow the lead-free solder. I didn't have this problem when I practiced on the donor board by installing the PMU from my good board because it was using leaded solder.\n\nI'll do some diagnosis of PPBUS_G3H to see if I can find out why it is cycling but unless you have any better ideas, I think I should probably remove the PMU again and try installing the one I recovered from the donor board, with leaded solder this time. Failing that I might just have to admit defeat and send the board off to someone in the UK who does board level repairs. Recommendations welcome.\n\nHave a nice weekend."

            "message": "Since I took the readings earlier, the diode mode to ground (red on ground) for PPBUS_G3H has changed slightly to 0.402. Maybe due to capacitors discharging while it was powered down for a couple of hours. \n\nAnyway, I used this 0.402 figure to search for a coil with similar diode mode value to ground (again red on ground) and found L7600. This coil works with U7600 dual MOSFET to turn PPBUS_HS_OTH5V (PPBUS_G3H via current sensor) into PP5V_G3S.\n\nI did some diode mode checks on U7600 Gate, Source and Drain in circuit and got these readings (first pin is red lead, second is black):\nD to G = ramps up quite quickly to beyond 1.999\nG to D = 1.354 stable\nD to S = ramps up quite quickly to beyond 1.999\nS to D = 0.476 stable\nG to S = 1.356 stable\nS to G = starts around 0.1xx and then slowly ramps up to 0.3xx before jumping to a solid 0.653 which is then stable\n\nThis doesn't jump out at me as being a faulty MOSFET but let me know if you disagree. I have one of these chips on my donor board so could swap it if you think that's worth a try.\n\nAnother coil, L7660 has a similar diode mode value of 0.374 but I checked the high and low side MOSFETs on that chip and there are no shorts either. \n\nCould it be U7650 that is faulty? Again I have one on my donor board but the part number is TPS51980B on the 01700 board and TPS519080A on the donor board. Not sure if that is significant or not."

            "message": "Update: I think I've found the source of the short.\n\nI found a short across C7829 which is also connected to L7810 (Line PPVDDCPUSRAM_AWAKE)\n\nThis line runs at 0.8V to 1.06V at 1A max so I set up 1V on my PSU and 1A current limit and injected voltage on this line using IPA alcohol to indicate the heat sink. \n\nWhat I found is that the PCB trace leading from R7811 to the PMU was getting hot which is the feedback (PVDDCPUSRAMAWAKE_FB) line for Buck1. This line should not be taking any significant current and if you look at the PMU pinout it is surrounded by ground pins on 6 of 8 sides. So my guess is that there is a solder ball short to ground under the PMU chip due to bad soldering.\n\nSo, next step is to remove U7800 again and either reball and replace that new chip or install the chip from the donor board. \n\nQuestion - the smallest solder balls I have are 0.25mm. Are these too large for the U7800 PMU or should they be okay? I think my mistake was not using enough heat initially for lead-free solder and then when I started to really ramp up the heat and got a bit desperate to see the chip float, I tapped it from above too hard and caused the solder balls to be ejected from the bottom edge. The shorted pin is 4 rows from the bottom edge so might have got a bridge at the same time.\n\nAre we having fun yet! \ud83d\ude02"

It looks quite similar to the 01700 board I'm repairing but if there is firmware on the chip then you could be right, it might be incompatible. I didn't think there was any firmware on the U7800 because it's not listed in the \"Programmable Parts\" section in the schematics (page 3) but it makes sense that there is firmware.\n\nI also bought a new chip from see-ic on eBay and it was described as:\n[QUOTE]power Supply  IC Chip  338S00267 reball 338S00267-A0 338S00267-AO BGA IC for repair MacBook PRO A19** Logic Board 338500267 BGA IC for repair for Macbook  pro A17** repair 820-01041  MacBook PRO A19** Logic Board Repair[/QUOTE]\n\nNote it mentions the 820-01041 so maybe it's a better bet if I just reball it with leaded solder this time. It came with lead free solder and I didn't use enough heat when trying to fit it first time.\n\nLet me know if you agree it's worth replacing U7800 with the one I bought from see-ic or if you think I'd be better off trying to find a donor 01700 board. As you know, the 01700 board is hard to get at a good price as a donor. But iff anyone can supply a U7800 chip from one to me here in the UK, ideally already reballed, then I'd be happy to buy it. Or maybe I just pay a high price for the donor board and then sell it on afterwards.\n\nThanks."

            "message": "Hi, I just wanted to provide a final update and to say that unfortunately I'm going to have to abandon the repair.\n\nI reballed the chip I bought from see-ic which is supposedly compatible with the 01041 board, and this time the reball was good. However, after installing it on the board I went back to the same pulsing PPBUS which I had last time this chip was fitted and a short from L7810 to ground. At that time I postulated that maybe I had a short between the BGA solder balls but this time the soldering went really well with leaded solder so I think maybe the chip itself is faulty. That could have been caused by my original attempt at installing it where I didn't use a high enough temperature to melt the lead-free solder but probably applied the heat for too long.\n\nAs a last ditch attempt, I decided to try to reball the PMU chip I recovered from the 01814 board but the solder mask was starting to break down due to repeated repair attempts and it was just bridging all over the place. There was no way I could apply solder balls again because the balls were just flowing into what should have been masked. I hate to give up on anything but sometimes you just have to call it a day! I've got too many other demands on my time to keep going. \n\nI've learned a lot and I want to thank you for your help and patience. I have no doubt that the fault was with U7800 which subsequently blew R7900, but I took too many attempts to gain the skill required to complete the repair successfully.\n\nPlan B is unfortunately to get Apple to replace the logic board and after that I'll probably sell the machine and buy a MacBook Air instead. I don't really want to continue to be the owner of a 01700 board now that I know how many issues they have!\n\nKind regards,\nCraig."
