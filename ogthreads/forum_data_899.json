            "message": "One of my coworkers has a Macbook air with liquid spill on Q7630 shorting PPBUS to PP1V05_S0.\nThe PPBUS line dropped from 8V to 2.9V since the shorted line pulled a lot of amperage.\nHe has managed to replace Q7630 Mosfet with an new one but now the board behaves as follows:\n\n- As soon he connects the charger, he gets a green light (then it turns orange) and he expects the fan turns on-off-on-off-on-off-on but after the fan turns for a sec nothing happens further.\nI would say it is a quarter fan spin but it stays on for too long.\nIn this one second he measured all the S0 Rails one by one and all of them are present.\nHe tried to boot with SMC bypass method but he get the same behavior expect the fan spun at 100%\n\nFurthermore the board managed to boot once completely and he could use the OS normally... but after reboot he had the same behavior as before!\n\nSo this is what I know at the moment. I will take a look on the board by myself after the weekend.\nI told him first to check the current sense lines ....\nHave you any other ideas where to look at?"
