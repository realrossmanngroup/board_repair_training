The fans run high after a while (without running Heaven), with low temperatures in iStats. ASD doesn't work, not sure why: 1) EFI version claims I'm using the wrong version (3S150) 2) Internet version produces a '...cannot load EFI/Drivers/TestSupport.efi' error.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated."

(tested without SSD) Google tells me more people have experienced this issue after a firmware update.\n\ngfxcardstatus won't let me change to integrated and stays on dedicated, no matter how many times I click. Sounds like a mux problem to me. I'll try if replacing the mux changes anything."
