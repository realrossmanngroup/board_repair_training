            "message": "Hi, I have an A1990 board 820-01041-A, no corrosion or liquid.\nThe NANDs on the left (immediately  are getting warm after 10 seconds or so, then get hot - no power. The trackpad was clicking, after trying DFU revive it doesn't click any longer.\n\nBoard is taking 20V and bouncing between 0.1A and 0.7A\nPPBUS_G3H is present bouncing between 10.6V and 12.5V\nPP2V5_NAND_SSD0 is shorted to ground\nPP1V8_SSD0 is present 1.8V\n\nI was reading on RepairWiki that what is important is that PPBUS_G3H doesn't go direct to the NAND - pardon my stupid question but how can one check this? Would the PP1V8_SSD0 and PP2V5_NAND_SSD0 lines be ~12V?\n\nI will check tomorrow under thermal camera once I am back in the shop, with my novice knowledge does this mean SSD is dead?"
