            "message": "Originally this board came in with what I believed to be U8900 issue but I think was malfunctioning GPU regardless as resoldering with lead solder U8900 multiple times. Something happened while working on board that caused PPBUS G3H to drop to 1.4V. I discovered that appeared to be a short but was issue with U8930 that mustve been shorting PPVIN s5_HS_GPU to GFXIMVP phase line.\n\nI tried bypassing the GPU thinking this would solve the board not booting but no change."
