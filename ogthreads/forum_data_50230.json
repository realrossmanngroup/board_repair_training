            "message": "Hell gents,\n\nHave a MacBook air logic board that first came in for no power. Found a couple issues:\n\n1. 10k resistor install on R5189 (schematic has this as omitted, so pulled it off)\n2, C5008, C5007, C7714, R5177, R5100 all corroded. Replaced.\n3. R5177 missing solder pad on pad 2, Jumpered to R5178 pad 2. \n\nOther than those components above, no other corrosion found. It appears the board was once cleaned, so i'm assuming it there was more corrosion originally. \n\nNow the board powers up (doesn't boot/chimes). The fan spins, the gradually ramps up to max speed, then the board shuts off. Repeats the same thing over and over. \n\nAny suggestions?"
