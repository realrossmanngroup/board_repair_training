This machine works fine, however when closing the lid in sleep mode, after 15 seconds when opening again, it shuts down and shows the message \"unexpected shutdown\". Reboots and then you can use it again. After every sleepmode, it will reboot. Did anyone see this issue before? No liquid spil on the board."
