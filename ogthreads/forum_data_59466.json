After which machine is dead - i'm thinking the USB 5V S3 Rail has been back fed with the power from the drive and killed something. \n\nI've checked PP5V_S3 for shorts and found none. I'm  not getting any S4 power rails but I am getting PP3V3_S5 and PP5V_S5. PPBUS_G3H is present, green light is on the charger which changes to orange as I would expect. \nPM_SLP_S4_L is missing however the prerequisites for it are there. PPVRTC_G3H, RTC_RESET_L, PP3V3_SUS etc. \n\nAnyone know the likely problem given the history?"
