            "message": "So, I have this 820-3332 machine I bought from eBay because I'm an idiot.\n\nAs soon as I got it I could see melted plastic and ripped up screwposts near the gpu. \nHowever the seller seems like a nice guy and said the laptop was like that when he bought it, but it's been working until recently. He also refunded me a good chunk of my money so I got an alright deal overall.\n\nQ8930 was shorted so I replaced it along with U8900 from a donor board. Now the laptop will start and chime, but I get no voltage at L8930/L8960, and therefore no image or backlight. This is because GPUVCORE_EN is low/zero, but U9100 area looks good. \n\nIn the past I've seen dead GPUs on these boards but usually it'll at least get VCORE and show an image with artifacts. Should I just give up and bypass the GPU or is something else keeping GPUVCORE_EN low (it's not shorted to ground, I checked)\n\nAny help is hugely appreciated, thanks"
