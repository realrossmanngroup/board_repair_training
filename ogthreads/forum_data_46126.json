Since I can't find the correct schematic and brd I'm using the 820-00239 one, seems to work ok with this board.\n\nThe board takes about 0.77A and CPU is getting hot, so seems to boot. I'm not getting All_SYS_PWRGD tho.\nSome measurements:\n\nPP3V0_G3H = 3V\nPPVCC_S0_CPU = 1.098V\nPP0V6_S0_DDRVTT = 0.6V\nPP1V8_S0 = 1.8V\nPP1V2_S0SW = 1.2V\nPP1V0_S0SW = 1V\nPP5V_S0_T139 = 5.12V\nPP5V_S0 = 5.12V\nPP3V3_S0 = 3.33V\nSMC_PM_G2_EN = 3.4V\nPM_PCH_PWROK = 3.31V\nPP3V3_PMICLDO = 3.29V\nPPBUS_PMIC = 13.03V\nCPU_VCCST_PWRGD = 0.999V\nS5_PWRGD = 3.25V\nSMC_DELAYED_PWRGD 3.4V\n\nThose rails look fine to me, still U7800 it not turning All_SYS_PWRGD on.\n\nNo visible liquid damage. I kind of suspect U7800, but the area around that chip looks just fine."

Can't test USB activity since this board doesn't have actual USB-B connection, and I don't have a USB-C>USB-A convertor\n\nI am noticing that if you leave power on for a while, and the CPU is getting really hot the fans start spinning. But no fan spin when you apply power to a cooled board\n\n[edit]\nI did find a USB-C->A convertor, but no USB activity it seems (tested with a USB drive with a flashing LED, no light at all on the USB drive)"

Is it possible there is a line break in the ALL_SYS_PWRGD line, so U7800 is actually outputting voltage on ALL_SYS_PWRGD to the CPU, but not to other parts of the system? Would not be easy to check I guess\n\n[edit]\nLet's say just for testing purposes I manually wire 3.3V to ALL_SYS_PWRGD on R7103 or R7805, can something go wrong? Can I break more than already is?"
