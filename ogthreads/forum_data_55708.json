No shit on lcd connector and FPC: \n\n\nI checked and see that EDP_BKLT_EN is 0V so it's not enabling backlight , right? \n\n\nThis signal is generated by U9800 checked and it's not generating 0V on R9827. \n\n\nThe problem is that it doesnt start even with external monitor. I dont know what this machines do when you connect external monitor and boot them. \n\n\nAlso it's strange that CPU is getting just warm and GPU stays cold. \n\n\nAny idea?"
