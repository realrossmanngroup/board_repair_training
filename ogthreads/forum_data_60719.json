Already replaced with a known good lcd, and ot doesn't power on.\n\nI has 19.5V on ampmeter, and consumes around 0.55 A to 0.86 A (only board. Full assembled and with battery it gets to around 2A).  CPU gets hot, but it seams to don't have CPU activity, because the caps lock doesn't turn on, and doesn't show any image on external monitor.\nCan't see any damage components on board.\n\nPPVCC_S0_CPU = 1V\nPPVCC_CPU PH1/2 = 1V\nPPDCPRTC_PCH= 1.6V\nPPVCCGT = 0V\n\nWhat should i check?\n\nCan you help?"
