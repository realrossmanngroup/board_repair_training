Board pulls 20V from charger but Im getting 11V on PPBUS, 14M resistance to ground when powered off.\n\nDiode red on ground = .391 (after 10 seconds)\n\nI get 20V, seems to pull .8 amps then reboot after a minute.  Any tips?  T2 gets warm, no fan spin."

Thinking I messed up the job I removed the chip, cleaned the pads again, confirmed no short now, and used a second chip.  2.5 switch is still 0 ohms to ground. I've never measured this to know if it's supposed to be open when off.\n\nDid I get bad chip order or am i smoothbraining something."
