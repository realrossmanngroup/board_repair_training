            "message": "Hi,\nI am practising with another 820-00840-A board that does not turn on.\nThere is no sign of liquid damage.\n\nMy charger gives 20V so I have PPBUS_G3H.\nPP3V3_G3H gives me 3.41V\n\nThen my S5 rails are all missing.\nI figured that PP3V3_S5 reads 7 Ohms to ground. I suppose this means a short to ground. I know 7 Ohms could be fine for some rails such as CPU VCore, but I think this is no good for that PP3V3_S5 rail, right ?\n\nIs there anything else I should check before I try to inject some voltage into that rail in order to find the short ?"

I could see it was drawing between 200mA and 300mA for some time, but while I was trying to feel heat on the board, I saw the power supply current went down to just a few milliamps.\nSo, looks like the short fused by itself. Now it is gone, and I have about 0.6KOhms to ground on PP3V3_S5 which looks quite better.\n\nHowever, I still do not have any S5 rails coming up. At the moment, I can only see PPBUS_G3H and PP3V3_G3H coming up."

I went on and checked the U7890 gate that controls PM_EN_PVXS5, it has power from PPBUS_G3H however its two inputs are low. One of them comes from the SSD connector, so it's probably normal as I do not have an SSD connected. The other one comes from the PMIC U7800.\nLooks like that chip has two power inputs, one that comes from PP3V3_S5, but it can't be that one, since that chip must turn on the S5 rails, so...\nThe other power input that I see is PP3V3_LDO3V, and on that one I only get 1.8V, so something is probably wrong there I guess ? It reads 27 Ohms to ground."

So all I am missing now, is essentially CPU Vcore.\n\nThe boards draws 240mA at 20 Volts for a little while, then down to 20mA for a few seconds, and then back to 240mA and stays there.\nThe CPU get just a little warm, not hot.\n\nPPVCCCPU_S0G measures 7 Ohms to ground\nPPVCCGT_S0G measures 4 Ohms to ground\n\nI do not have a reference board to compare this to, so I'm not sure if this is right or wrong."
