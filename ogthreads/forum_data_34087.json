Any chance you damaged them?\nMaybe someone else has any idea because I don't understand how these will \"burn\" (even when under full load they shouldn't be), these do not have a simple path to ground and also the charger would immediately cut out if it were to happen.\n\nResistance to ground (in Ohms) on PPDCIN_G3H_INRUSH? Using an original adapter or chinese copy?\n\nIf you're sure everything is soldered on correctly you might want to try and replace Q7080/85 and U7000 all at the same time."
