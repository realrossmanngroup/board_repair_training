I get steady 3.3V on L7220 and steady 12.54V on PPBUS_G3H. Get a sparkle of 5V on L7260 when quarter fan spin. Already verified all traces around ISL and all look good. There was no corrosion at all on this board! I'm lost, because this is the first quarter fan spin that is giving me so much trouble!"

I think this machine had been worked on before he bought it(he bought it used but working), but cannot be sure because it had no oxidation points nor solder marks on it... The board looked very clean!"
