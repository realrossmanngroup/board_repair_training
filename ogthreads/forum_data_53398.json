            "message": "My first post , Hi to all you nice people :)\nplease bare with me I am a total newbie at this . I tried to find similar posts to find a solution but couldnt .\nI have 4 boards with exactly the same problem , at least the symptoms are exactly the same .\nNo liquid damage and no corrosion whatsoever. They all start and come up to 1.5A and after 3 seconds drop down to 0v and that repeats all the time . I am guessing you all will say the cpu is dead but still maybe someone have some other idea ?  The boards are three 3787 and one 3662. They all have fanspin and green and orange light. They have no chime and with a usb mouse plugged in it briefly flashes and turnes off in the same pace as the boards go down to 0v. Please tell what measurements you need to make a diagnose or point me in the right direction . All if any help is highly apreciated . Thanks in advance . here are some measurements I made so far\nPPDCIN_G3H 16   -  18.12 V\nPPBUS_G3H  -    12.58 V\nPPVIN_S5_HS_OTHER5V_ISNS   -   12.57 V\nPPVIN_S5_HS_OTHER3V3_ISNS  -  12.56 V\nPPVIN_S5_HS_GPU_ISNS   -   12.57 V\nPPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS   -   12.57V\nPP5V_S5   -    5.64 V\nPP3V3_S5   -  3.33 V\nPP5V_S4 - 5.0 V\nPP3V3_S4 - 3.3V\nPP5V_S3 - 5.0V\nPP1V35_S3  - 1.34 V\nPP3V3_S3 - 3.33 V\nPPVTTDDR_S3  - 0.68 V\nPP1V05_S0  - 1.05V\nPPVCC_S0_CPU   -  1.79V\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.3V\nPP3V42_G3H 3.4V\nPP1V0_S0GPU_ISNS 0 V\nPP1V5R1V35_S0GPU  -  1.5 V\nPP3V3_S0GPU - 3.3 V"
