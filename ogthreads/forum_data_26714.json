The option to through this board in the thrush will not helps me understand more. To others the situation maybe it is not and I can fully understand.\n\nBack to my problem.\n\nAfter looking to the circuit around the U7400, I ve found the Q7403 was short to GND. I ve replaced this one and Q7402 and now the U7400 is not hating anymore. \n\nBut still no image on screen.\n\nAfter doing some measurement I ve found that no PPBUS_SW_BKL is appearing on the C9712. This leaded me to look for where this has stopped. PPBUS_SW_LCDBKLT_PWR must be generated by the Q9806 if PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_FUSED is present and the gate is low. After measuring PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_FUSED was present ~12V but the gate signal (LCDBKLT_EN_DIV) was high ~10V. This is supposed to be ~4V.\n\nLCDBKLT_EN_DIV to have that low value the FET Q9807 need be activated by the presence of a high value of the LCD_BKLT_EN. This signals is unfortunately coming from the MCP.\n\nAccording to my analyse above will this mean that this MCP has another problem then the original one?\nBecause before soldering it on the board I ve asured that the RTC cuircuit was not short to the GND by measuring.\n\nOr you guys you can see something else?"
