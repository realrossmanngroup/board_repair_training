Also had a lot of corrosion from water damage on the underside of the board and I had to make a couple of jumpers on PP3V42_G3H at C4903, C4908 and C4902.\n\nIt has been running fine for a few weeks apparently but now it won't turn on - the fan spins for a split second and then straight off. If I have the charger plugged in it will attempt to turn on every ~5 seconds.\n\nI'm getting green and orange lights.\n\nAny suggestions as to where to start would be greatly appreciated."
