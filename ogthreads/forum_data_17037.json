The power light comes on in that time and then goes off when the fan stops. When connecting to power, the fans starts to spin for 2 seconds, then stops and starts again. Still will not switch on. I tried a p tram reset just in case and nothing happens so it isn't switching on. When power is connected, the light on the connector lights up green then goes red. Has something gone wrong with the programming or am I diagnosing a power problem?\nThanks"
