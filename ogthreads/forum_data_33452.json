            "message": "Hi. I have this 2010 pro. Customer said he got gifted this machine without hdd. Asked me to install a ssd. Installation of the os stops abruptly after internet recovery with a white screen and fan at 100%/top cause hot.\n\ni suspected it was a GPU issue and I found the gpu and vram covered in crusty flux residue and shit. I asked the customer and he said the previous owner had the GPU replaced.\n\nnow i doubt there are any good chips left for this work plus that ram irks me. But the customer want \"to be 100%\" sure.. so what ASD do i have to use on this machine so i can show him it is the fucked GPU?"
