            "message": "If you're still having the issue that the MCP voltage isn't at the right range but around 0.2V - 0.8V make sure to replace C7771 with a NEW capacitor.\nAll these capacitors will die over time and getting them from a donor board probably doesn't make them much healthier. \n\nMeasure resistance from C7771 (MCP Rail) to ground, then desolder C7771 and do the same measurement to ground. (Make sure to wait until the resistance stabilises)\nYou will probably find that the resistance without C7771 goes up by almost half because this capacitor is leaking power away to ground combined with reduced capacity. \n\nIf you don't want to do the scratching just get a replacement capacitor from farnell (or whatever distributor you want to use), they have perfectly fitting tantalum capacitors. (However these caps will also most likely die again in a few years). Only cost a few bucks and you will use them in the future on other repairs of this exact same board!"

Why this 820-2330 A board was equiped with 50 Ohms resistors but in ALL the schematics\n\nThanks"
