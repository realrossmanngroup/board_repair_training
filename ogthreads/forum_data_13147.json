            "message": "Hi got a mega strange 820-2915. it was working fine and pop, C4696 blows out. I replace it and the same happens again, i replace the entire USB power circuit, same again. i just think- ill rmeove USB power completely and see what it does, after a little while some more smoke comes out, this time its blown a whole in u7300, a previusly working component, Its also destroyed the pp5vs3 trace on it.\n\nSeems to be blowing up anything random on the pp5vs3 rail at this point.\nAny ideas?"
