I marked these areas that had the liquid damage before cleaning and replacing components.\n\nd7050/c7050/c7060 area\nvias above kbd connector and other side\nr4856/r4857/r4858/r4810/c4810 ( These components were all replaced)\nisl6259 area c7150 (replaced C7116)\nU1900 and C1924 (C1924 was burned so I replaced it as well as U1900)\n\nThe machine turns on when I plug in the charger and it takes about 5 seconds before it boots to the apple logo.\nIt takes a few seconds and loads up to the page you can see in the pictures below. I see the trackpad cursor on the page but it won't move when I use the trackpad.\nWhen I try to turn the machine off with the power button it doesn't turn work. I have to unplug the charger and battery in order to shut it off.\n\n[url]https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vryoho2y7j04zsz/AABUniyEGPepOlIJWe4zjXJya?dl=0[/url]"

I also plugged in another tpad cable and still nothing changed.\nThe trackpad connector looks perfectly clean on both sides of the board.\n\nI also plugged in a new keyboard and that one didn't work either. I tried plugging in a usb with mac osx and hold option key but nothing happened. I also couldn't turn the machine off with the new keyboard.\n\nDo you know what exactly those images mean? I can't find any information on it"

            "message": "Okay so now I plugged in a new trackpad and cable together and this time when I booted it took me to the screen where it asks to choose the language for your computer so I think the trackpad may need replacing. When I do try to move my finger around on the trackpad the cursor does not move but I'm not sure if that is because the trackpad is not assembled into the machine.\n\nI also plugged in another keyboard and I still cannot turn the machine off with the power button or use the option key to boot.\n\nI checked voltages on the keyboard connector (J4813)\nPins 1/2/3 - 0v\nPin 4 - 3.42v\nPin 5 - 0v\nPin 6 - saw 1.3v and it goes down.\n\nOn the other side of the board I checked for continuity from Pin 2 of R4810 to Probe #816 and there was no beep.\nThere is continuity though from Pin 5 of J4813 to the via above it. \n\nUpdate: I ran a wire from Pin 2 of R4810 to Probe #816 and now the power button works to turn off the machine.\nI'm still not able to boot my usb stick with the option key pressed even though I see Pin 2 of J4813 jump to 3.4v when I press the left option key."
