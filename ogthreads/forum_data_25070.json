            "message": "I'm working on an 820-3332 that had some sort of power incident. Q7035 was blown in half with a minor hole in the board (just that top ground plane, easy to isolate and repair). I got the Q7030/Q7035/U7000/Q7080 issue all worked out. They were all taken out, and had to be replaced. Once replaced, I get green light (no light before) and fan spin. I noticed someone had fucked with the BIOS chip at some point, so I loaded up a clean dump (clean ME region, one that I've used 10+ times before), and still no chime, video/BL, etc., just continuous fan. Tried dump on another board to be sure, and it works well.\n\nBoard heats up as it should and my vcore is present (light on mouse present). I didn't find any other missing rails (3v3_s0, 5v_s0, ppbus, 3v42, vrtc, all present and steady). Any direction from here would be much appreciated.\n\nI'll go through all my pgood signals tomorrow, but am I correct in thinking that if vcore is present and fans spin, that my pgood signals (p1v8s0, 1v5s0, etc) are all present and not waste time there, or should I check elsewhere?"

            "message": "There is no need to go through PGOOD signals once Vcore is there. If the mouse lights up the board is at least doing something. But seeing that the BIOS was fucked with this board could have absolutely anything wrong with it. From knocked off component to more damage from a power surge. Common U8900 issue taken care off?"
