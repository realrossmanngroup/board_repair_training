Replaced those components and diode measurement was still at .300 on PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC. So I reflowed the SMC and diode measurement is now @ .475 on PP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC.  Green light is back and board turns on. Only thing is that it turns off while booting to ssd and may or may not turn back on right away. This occurs with AC or Battery power. The last time this occured I hit the board with some hot air and it turned on. This however could just be coincidence. Looks like I will be doing some more measuring in tha AM. Thanks for your help, its greatly appreciated guys."

I have found that this happens when ANYTHING is plugged into the KB/TP connector. I have tried new cables and trackpads and keyboards. The connector looks ok but I am going to change it anyway. If that does not resolve the issue then most likely issue with one of the _s4 lines? Thanks guys, have a good one."
