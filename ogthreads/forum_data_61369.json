Some info about board:\n\n- Stuck at 5v 0,45A\n- LDO's on CD3215 are not shorted\n- PPBUS_G3H is 0V, shorted to groud on system side (diode mode 0,000V)\n- PPBUS_HS_CPU 0V, shorted to ground  (diode mode 0,000V)\n- PPBUS_G3H and PPBUS_HS_CPU are shorted to each other (diode mode 0,000V, 0,000ohm resistance)\n- PP3V3_G3H is 0V, not shorted (diode mode 0,384V)\n\nIs there any sense do dig into this board? I guess CPU got 12V from PPBUS and got fried, right?"
