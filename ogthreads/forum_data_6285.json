I get 17.09 volts on pin one but 0 on pin 2, R7010 is giving the correct resistance at 30.1k ohms, but R7011 gives .5 ohms on the board and the correct 9.3k ohms off the board, I have no idea why Im getting the wrong value when on the board. While the resistor is off I get infinite resistance between 1 and 2 as expected."
