The Board looks very clean, no signs of liquid damage. \nThe MacBook turns on, I was able to install MacOS (even if it took about 4h), but it is running very low. \nI already did clean ME BIOS, replaced trackpad flex and tried another SSD, but without success. \n\n[ATTACH]60953[/ATTACH] [ATTACH]60954[/ATTACH]\nAm I missing something?\n\nBest regards and thank you very much!"
