No liquid damage on the board itself.\n\nReplaced both CD3217s board now has 20v but only using 0.06 amps. No fan spin now.\n\nU7210 and U7270 looked burnt, replaced them as well but no change.\n\nAll AWAKE and SLP2R voltages are present but cannot enter DFU mode.\n\nPP5V_G3S is shorted but nothing gets warm on thermal cam.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is 12.30V\n\nNot sure where to go from here."
