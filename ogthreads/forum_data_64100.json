            "message": "Hello, I have this mac that does not turn on. According to the customer, it was connected to the charger and did not turn on after a lightning strike. There is no sign of burned on the board, but I identified that it has already passed through another workshop. A CD3215 was replaced (U3100), CPU is without the side resins (looks good though), apparently the U7650 was replaced or at least removed once and the J5250 was destroyed. Those are the measurements so far: \n\nPPBUS_G3H: 13V\nPP3V3_G3H: 3.4V\nPP3V0_G3H: 3.0V\nPP3V3_S5: 3.3V\nPP5V_S5: 5.1V\nS5_PWRGD: 3.3V\nPP3V3_S4: 0V no short, no pulse\nPP5V_S4: 0V no short, no pulse\nPP3V3_SUS: 0V no short, no pulse\n\nPM_PWRBTN_L: 3.3V\nPM_BATLOW_L: 3.3V\nPM_DSW_PWRGD: 3.4V\nPM_RSMRST_L: 0V no short, no pulse\nPCH_INTRUDER_L: 2.8V\nPCH_SRTCRST_L: 3.0V\nRTC_RESET_L: 3.0V\nPM_SLP_S5_L: 0V no short, no pulse\nPM_SLP_SUS_L: 0V no short, no pulse\n\nThere is drop pulse at PM_PWRBTN_L when you press SMC_ONOFF_L\n\nI have already replaced a missing diode (D3302) in the USB-C area, replaced the J5250 and replaced the U5000 from an identical donor board just to try. Same behavior. Possible PCH failure? Thanks in advance."
