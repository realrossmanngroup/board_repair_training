My last problem (i hope so) is the touchbar - it only shows green vertical stripes (see picture attached).\n\nUnfortunately I don't have a known good touchbar. So i tested the board with three different touchbars (theoretically they could all be damaged).\nOne of them shows nothing - probably dead. The other two touchbars shows the same picture - only green stripes.\n\nHow could i go about troubleshooting here?\n\n\n[ATTACH]60279[/ATTACH]"
