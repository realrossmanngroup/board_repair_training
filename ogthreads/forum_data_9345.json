            "message": "Ive got a 820-3115 that worked perfect at one time until i put a (killer) battery. this battery killed 2 machines in the same way. so after plugging in the machine wouldn't recognize the battery or run on battery power. i chased this back to a problem with in the SMC. i had a doner board it thought i would try to reball and if that went well maybe install in this board. \n\nIt in fact worked and the machine sees the battery now and runs on battery power but now it does not charge the battery. \nIve checked the current sensing resistors and all check out just fine. Saw one of louis videos about this and decided to check for bc_acok. it appears i have a short to ground on pin 4 of u6901, but only when battery is plugged in. \n\nAny ideas on this?"
