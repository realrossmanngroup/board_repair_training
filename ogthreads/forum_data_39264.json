            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have been watching Louis' videos for some time now and finally got around to trying to troubleshoot what's wrong with my 2012 15\" Unibody Macbook Pro.\n\nI am new to this so I don't really know where to start diagnosing. I have some donor boards which I can take components off of.\n\nOne thing to note is plugging in the charger, even for 5 minutes, the board gets really hot which makes me believe I have a short somewhere.\n\nCan anyone please provide some tips as to where to start from so I can hopefully find the root of the problem?"
