I get 12.6v but it constantly fluctuates. I went back to the Q7085 and I get 16.5v for a couple of seconds, then it fluctuates down to about 3.4 and jumps back up to 16.5v and repeats.\nI get the same result at R7020\nAt R7021 it drops to 15.8v on pin 2, at R7022 it is at 16.5v all voltages fluctuate. The corresponding pins on C7020 are the same 15.8v and 16.5v, So unless i am mistaken this is working correctly. Of course i am not really sure if it is supposed to fluctuate and the computer still has green and no orange with battery and will not boot.\nCharger A Gate is 17v\n\nAny ideas"
