            "message": "This board had no liquid damage and no other visible damage. So it was starting off with intermittent blackscreens, which I thought I traced to the dedicated graphics not getting power on gpuvcore as it seemed to black out when it was switching, and now when I try and plug it in, I get the orange light, but the fan will rarely spin, and I hear clicking noises coming from the circuitry, and yes it does seem to be the electronics, because it will click even with the fan unplugged. I thought this might be a coil or mosfet as I have heard of them making strange noises like clicking, but I'm a bit lost here, especially since it will turn on randomly after plugging it in many times.\n\nEdit: and I am using an 85W charger"
