            "message": "Got a macbook that had nasty corrosion and build up all over, not knowing better I threw it in the ultrasonic and now I am able to see the damage. My first questions are:\n1: am I supposed to have U7190  as a chip or just soldered pads on the board? (I know this might be a dumb question but I have been researching this board and all the pics I have found have the area where that component goes looking like a ghost town, with only solder pads and no components (chips, resistors nor capacitors) )\n\n2: I am missing some of the gold check points on the board (not sure what these would be called) that as per boardview, these appear to be related to a power grid, what are the do's and dont's when running jumping wires? Since these are pads on the board itself and form part of a circuit of about 5 components. I will provide more details once I am back in my garage.\nthx in advance!"

As for the test points, these are gone from corrosion, not missing, didnt explain my self there. They are more so dark deep spots and I am thinking I need jump wires but not sure."

I will post some pics once Im home.... the \"holes\" where the test points were are not in line with any component nor on any path that I can see, just at the sides of a diode (will post which one) that is part of PP3V42, per the schematic, these test points should measure 3.42V. Again, I will post hi res pics once I get back home. \nThx so much!!"

Overall the board looks fine, didnt find any traces messed up nor anything, with the exception of these test point that I thought were needed to complete the circuit but, as I am posting this, I am realizing they are called TEST POINTS only so, not really needed for functionality correct? Of course like you stated, unless they were on a trace line or on top of a via. One of these ALMOST ate a via away.
