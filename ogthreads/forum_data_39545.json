            "message": "[FONT=arial][SIZE=12px][COLOR=#000000]Hi everyone,[/COLOR]\n\n[COLOR=#000000]I would like to know from your experiences when do you change the battery of a MacBook. Apple recommends to change it after 1000 cycles, but personally I wait until the battery completely stop working normally (shut down the MacBook immediately after unplug, or at 30-50 %). Do you know if I take a risk by doing this (for the DC-in board, the logic board, battery swelling, or even set the MacBook in fire) ?[/COLOR]\n\n\n[COLOR=#000000]This is important for me, because when a client ask me for battery replacement because he MacBook tell him \"replace now\" the battery, I recommend him to go to Apple orI offer to change it for a second hand battery, because as you now It's hard to find new original battery. But I would like to know if I can recommend him to keep his battery until it stop working normally.\n\n\nOn chinese \"new\" batterys : [/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/36691-a1398-2012-shutdown-at-40-battery-discharged"
