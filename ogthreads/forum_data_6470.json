Now i get the following components very hot when i put 3 volts on them :\n\nC2901\nC3101\n\nC2300\n\nas well as the RAM blocks.\n\nAny suggestions? PP3V42 ist present and stable, i have green light as well. F7040 is shorted on PIN2, that where i put 3V on the board."

Source from scrap board...Any board that has a TPS51116 on it, you can then also take the FETs if they are the same size. Exact part numbers are not critical on the FETs.\nActually measure resistance to GND on the 3V42_G3H bus, anything under 17K will also be a dead MCP89 and also make it instant death."
