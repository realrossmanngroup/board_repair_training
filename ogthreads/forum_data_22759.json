            "message": "Came in with a significant coffee spill around U6990.\n\nGave it an ultrasonic clean as it was still sticky.\n\nR6920 and R6905 were burnt out. Replaced them, got green light but n fan spin. A few minutes later R6920 burnt out. Replaced it again and looked around for a short on the G3H lines but couldn't find anything.\n\nNow I get no green light but R6920 and R6905 measure correct. But the voltage on R6905 is somewhere around 0.7v and always moving. Diode mode on R6905 is about 0.130.\n\n\nppbus_g3h     = 8.20 - 8.50.\npp3v42_g3h   = 2.66 - moving\n\n\nEdit: Any idea why the battery interface was designed the way it was for this model? Seems overly complicated for almost zero benefit."
