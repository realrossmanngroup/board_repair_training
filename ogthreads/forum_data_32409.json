            "message": "Hi,\n\nGot this board in for GPU replacement. Basic video card failure symptoms. Was getting stuck loading video card drivers. Reflowed the chip to diagnose the problem. Confirmed. \nAlso experienced some side problems: sometimes machine would not recognise my external boot drive on first try and PRAM reset would not work. (decided to check if the problem would still be present after GPU replacement).\nI did not have 0084 chip in stock so decided to risk it and replace it with 0005.\nAfter gpu replacement, no image, no chime, fan half spin.\nTook a close look at the board. Found C8403 missing with broken pad on pin 1. Threw a jumper to C8452. Same problem.\nOrdered a new 0084 chip. Replaced. Now gets stuck on chime loop on boot, no image, fan spin normal. Chime loop is when it keeps giving chime every 1.5 seconds.\nTime to hit panic button.\n\nPlease advise how to proceed.\n\nThanks!"
