Customer says it used to work with a PRAM reset but now it doesn't.\nAlthough the chime is present when turn on, most times in System preferences it says that No Output Devices found. If it works, when youtube for example is playing something the sound dies and the volume bar is gone when pressing the buttons and the Mac becomes laggy.\nIn Diagnostics it gave me once : There may be an issue with the audio hardware. Reference code : VFF001"
