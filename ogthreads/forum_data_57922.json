No liquid damage but brain dead with 1.7V on PPVCC_S0_CPU\n\nAfter measuring for PP3V3R3V0_AON on C4650 getting 3.2V both machines suddenly now boot up  normally with 1.5V on PPVCC_S0_CPU\n\nShould U4700 still be replaced even though they are working now after just measuring the power rail?\n\nFirst time I have run into this particular situation."

Yes I know they are famous for dead CPUs but that still does not answer my question about returning it to customer with original U4700 or replace it even though its working now after only measuring it?\n\nTrying to understand why/how only measuring PP3V3R3V0_AON with the multi meter brought both machines back to life\n\nYes still running fine if board is flexed a bit"
