GOt arange and green light, fan spins for a few seconds and stops. CPU gets warm. Below all readings. The rest of the board all looks OK, also near U1950 and SMC.

So it looks like the 3 x spin before boot, but it keeps doing that it does not turn off and doesnt boot either. As mentioned CPU gets hot so that seems to work.\n\nPS sorry for the slow reply im working a number of other boards at the same time and this one is a no rush job :)."
