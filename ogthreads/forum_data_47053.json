            "message": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to fix a 820.4924 board for no other reason than to learn something new and save a macbook from the bin - i have never done anything like this in my life so it has been quite a curve !\n\nThe symptoms are that the mag safe orange light never goes green and the screen was showing a low battery picture but would never progress no matter how long left on charge.\n\nSo i removed the board from the machine - i only have a macbook air magsense 2 charger in the house which i understand should work to power up the board.\n\nThe board shows no signs of any damage so i followed the videos online and used boardview and the schematics to find that\n\n1. PP3V3_S5_SMC = 3.42\n2. SMC_BC_ACOK = 0.V\n\nWhich i think narrows the problem down to R5187 - again looks with no visible signs of damage\n\nAm I correct in my thinking ? is there anything else i should be doing as regards tests here ?\n\nMark"

            "message": "Well - the 45W charger does not start the machine and as the battery was dead ( i didnt know this) it could not charge the battery. Therefore it looked like the board was faulty. As soon as i got the right charger the machine works but tells me that the battery is needing replaced. So for this board a 60w charger is needed before doing anything else. A lesson for me right there ! I have learned a lot though poking about so nothing lost :)"
