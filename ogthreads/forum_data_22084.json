U7000 is new, all components around it check out fine.  20.25v off the io board.  no blown fuses (of course). chrgr_dcin at u7000 is 20.25 pin 3 of u7000 is reading somewhere around 4.5v.  Then suddenly, the charger only goes green, and shorts out and shuts off (to where I have to unplug it to reset it.)... any thoughts?"

[url]http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/ohms-law-calculator[/url] Try it out. \n\nChips that use LOTS of wattage at low voltage will have a low resistance to ground, it is just natural. Same thing with a speaker. If you look at receivers where it says 100w into 8 ohm load, 175w into 4 ohm load. It is able to deliver more power/current at the same voltage if the resistance is lower. A 3 ohm speaker is essentially a 3 ohm \"short\" but that does not mean it is \"broken.\""
