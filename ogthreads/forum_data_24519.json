            "message": "had some liquid damage, cleaned and replaced trackpad cable\nlower ram slot had one spec of corrosion and now seems to work fine\nI was considering replacing C7525-C7529, on computing HS\n\nturns on and everything works but after being on for like 10 minutes and warming up it shorts out and restarts\nsometimes it doesn'tt reboot and the screen goes all crazy like color check board\nthen it gives  the bad ram three beeps\nand when i try the top ram slot at this point it also does three beeps\n\nnot sure whether I should bother with those computing HS caps, or if its a ram slot problem, or graphic MUX\nany suggestions appreciated"
