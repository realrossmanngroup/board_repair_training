            "message": "Hello all! I have yet another MacBook that is sad.  ?  It is an A1708 that does not have a backlight (and possibly no image) going to the display. The laptop was brought to me because water was split on the laptop.\n\n[LIST]\n[*]The first thing I checked was to see if the MacBook would take 20V and it does reach 20V through both chargers. It typically takes about 500mA at first then settles between 150-300mA.\n[*]After opening, immediately noticeable was some corrosion near a few PPBUS _G3H caps, the area near U3890, and a couple other places. However, I did not find any shorts near those areas.\n[*]I checked for warm spots on the board and I noticed the area near the display connector was getting hot. I thought this was just the CPU at first, but the heat seemed too focused. I then removed the display flex cable and saw more corrosion near J8500. The worst of it was near the 5V camera line (PP5V_S0_ALSCAM). L4010 was burnt and the line was reading somewhere between 0.3V-0.5V. I replaced. the burnt filter and C4013 for good measure. This resolved the short on that line and 5V was returned to that line.\n[*]I checked the resistance on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT and I recall it being lower than expected (somewhere around 500-2K ohms). I removed J8500 along with a couple of capacitors near the connected. The connector looked corroded/carbonized near PP5V_S0_ALSCAM &PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT so it needed replaced anyway. Once this was done and the pins were cleaned up with fresh solder, the resistance on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT was restored to about 0.5M\u03a9.\n[/LIST]\nThe computer does turn on and boot to an external USB drive. I saw the activity light and I was able to remote into my copy of macOS while booted to this laptop. I also checked the continuity between the end of the display flex cable and some of the lines on the logic board to check the connections. All of the ones I tested seemed to work just fine. There is no corrosion near the area of U8400. I guess I'm just a little stuck on what to check next as everything else seems to be working.  ?\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nVoltage Table:\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPBUS_G3H[/TD]\n[TD]13.05V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S0[/TD]\n[TD]5.10V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT[/TD]\n[TD]0.01V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT[/TD]\n[TD]0.08V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]BKLT_EN_R[/TD]\n[TD]0.0V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_F @ F8400[/TD]\n[TD]13.04V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_R @ Q8400[/TD]\n[TD]13.05V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]LCDBKLT_EN_L @ Q8400[/TD]\n[TD]12.93V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT @ Q8400[/TD]\n[TD]0.10V (Resistance: 0.45 M\u03a9)[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S0_BKLT[/TD]\n[TD]5.10V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nThanks in advance for reading this! ?"
