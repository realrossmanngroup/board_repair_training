            "message": "[PLAIN][SOLVED] 820-2936 works only from battery, also not charging - \"nice\" 40sec video included.[/PLAIN]\n\nHi guys (again),\n\nThis one has been giving me hard time for a while now. It would only run from battery and after some testing with the charger connected it went kinda FUBAR. I replaced isl6259 and noticed that Q7030 was getting really hot and green light was gone soon after that (also replaced Q7035). Now having tested most of resistors and various points for shorts I removed F7040 and injected 12V on ppbus_g3h pin. If I now connect the charger the fan starts - its also quite funny to watch the system staying on when the charger is afterwards removed (video).\n\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXYScevrZHU&feature=youtu.be[/url]\n\nIt seems the problem lies before the fuse but can't really focus on something.\n\nHope I am not wasting your time.\n\nGeorge"

The problem lies on ISL, maybe isl soldered wrong, replace ISL and output mosfets, also check sense resistors R7020 and R7021 should be 10 ohm each, measure resistance over pins 1 and 2 from C7020, should be 20ohm...... Measure R7051 (2.2ohm) and R7052 (0ohm), resistance over pin 1 and 2 from C7050 should be about 3-4ohm..."
