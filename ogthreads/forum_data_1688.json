            "message": "OK, so i read something in one of the forums and it got me curious about the other logic board like this one had so i plugged in a charger and tested some points. Everything was as it was before, seems like it should work but did not. Then I felt the ISL6259 chip and it was very hot. So I put some alcohol on it to see if it was really too hot or it was just me.\n\nWell...after I changed out the charger that went bad and plugged in another charger that worked, the green light came on and then the orange light came on indicating a battery charge. I pressed the power button and the computer turned on! However it started single beep indicating a bad ram slot. Removed ram from the slot and restarted and it loads into an operating system.\nProblems:\n1)bad ram slot\n2)fan stays on high all the time\n3)battery percentage shows then goes off, then shows, etc. I remember Louis talking about what controls that, but I have forgotten.Please help me with that.\n\nAll this leads me to believe that I had poor diagnostic skills and was not giving correct information.\nSee attached photos for progress\n\nSo other than the ram slot, any thoughts on how to address the other two issues?\nThanks"
