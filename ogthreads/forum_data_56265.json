            "message": "Hi,\nI was given a not working MBA in which coffee has been spilled.\nFirst inspection revealed a bit of corrosion next to U7200. I cleaned that, and replaced the caps and resistors involved.\nThe rest of the board has traces of coffee, but nothing too bad and no other trace of corrosion. I cleaned the coffee with alcohol.\n\nWhen I power the board, I get a green light and then orange light on the charger, so SMC talks to the charger properly.\nThe fan then starts spinning, which is usually a good sign. Board draws 156mA at that point.\n\nThen about 8 seconds later, the fan slowly starts ramping up to full speed. Once it is at full speed, I have a 192mA current draw on the board.\nIf I connect the board to the display, I get nothing there. No backlight, and also no image. I have no way to know if the display is working fine, and I don't have another one of that kind.\n\nI checked most power rails and they look good. I have working Vcore.\nCPU doesn't get hot.\n\nSo at that point I'm not sure if I have a working board with a defective screen, or a defective board. Any suggestion what I could try next ?"

Board draws 156mA.\nI assume the SMC wasn't happy while outside of the topcase due to missing sensors of some kind and commanded the fan to spin at full speed.\n\nSo now it looks like I have a board with a brain but no display."

Also there was a capacitor next to that pin which was totally destroyed (came into pieces with just a little push of tweezers)\nInterestingly, with the chip off the board, I now can see what you described, with the 3 start attempts.\nI have repaired the missing pad with a tiny bit of wire, and I now will need to get my hands on a replacement part for U1950 (could take a little while).\nCould a bad PCH_PWROK/PCH_SYS_PWROK have explained the previous symptoms ?"
