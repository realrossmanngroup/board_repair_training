            "message": "Sort of an interesting one here. Board had liquid, but was isolated in a few small areas. Replaced damaged components, and got fan/chime, but that's it. After chime, backlight comes on, but no image and no booting further. No flashing folder if I remove the SSD. No external video either. Keyboard backlight never turns on, so the board isn't getting to OSX. It's stopping immediately after chime and backlight.\n\nBIOS and clock area both look great, and I assume they're fine since the unit chimes. Any idea where else to look? Any help appreciated."
