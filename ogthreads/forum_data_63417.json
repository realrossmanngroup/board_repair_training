            "message": "I have a 2017 13\" MacBook Pro motherboard (model 820-00840-A) that won't turn on. I measured the PPBUS_G3H line with a USB-C charger connected, and get around 1.08V (instead of 12V?). No short to ground in this line - resistance measures 1K ohms rapidly increasing to infinity.\n\nFuses F3000 and F3100 are both intact - I resistance tested them. However when I test for PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS (or the one for the other port) at either F3000 or F3100's terminals, I get zero volts at all. Measuring between ground and either of F3100 or F3000's terminals, I get a 22.8 ohm continuity. Is this a short to ground? How would I find this short? I see there are some adjacent capacitors, one of those?\n\nI probed for PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS at other adjacent points (including L3300 and L3400 solder pads - my board apparently never had these components) - no voltage at all.\nOther nearby voltage rails I probed: USBC_XA_CC2 (and CC1 and CC1/2_CONN) fluctuating between 0.8 and 1.5V, SAVE_CC1A no voltage at all.\n\nAnyone know what's wrong? Thanks in advance!"

            "message": "> Why continue doing that???\nSorry, I must have misunderstood, I thought that was one of the things you wanted me to test, when you said stop to check ohm scale or diode mode with power applied to board. By \"power applied to board\", did you mean the method of injecting 1V?\n\nMeasuring between PPBUS_G3H test point and ground with diode mode as instructed in your other post, I'm getting a reading of 480. You were right, I was using it with reverse polarity. Thanks!\n\nU7000 voltages:\nTBA_AUX_DET (measured at test point and C7016 pad - my board does not have the C7016 component) : [B]4.26V[/B]\nTBA_VDDA: (measured at test point and C7075):[B] 5.12V[/B]\nTBA_VDDP: (measured at C7077): [B]5.12V[/B]\nVery strange thing I noticed, when I had the multimeter probe touched to a screw point and C7077 measuring that voltage, I could hear an audible ticking sound from the circuit board - even though there are no moving parts on it??)\nCHGR_AMON (U7000 pin 19, measured at test point next to C7026 and at R5439: [B]0.01V[/B]\nCHGR_BMON (U7000 pin 14, measured at test point next to C7026 and at R5438:[B] 0.00V[/B]\nSMC_AUX_OK (U7000 pin 28, measured at test point next to C7724 and at R7071: [B]3.39V[/B]\nSMC_RESET_R_L (U7000 pin 39, measured at R7072 and test point next to it):[B] 3.39V[/B]\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by EN_VR1. My schematic for the 820-00840-A does not have this net at all, not at U7000 or anywhere else. I measured U7000 pin 34, TBA_HPWR_EN_L, at R7073: [B]3.10V[/B]. Is this what you meant?\n\nWhen I measure R7020's connections with the USB-C power cable connected to the other port, I get a reading of 1V or less continuously drifting down. My USB-C power meter also does not light up when connected to this port (the LCD on the meter flashes on for a fraction of a second every few seconds. I tried wiggling and moving the plug - no luck.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, maybe? : when I plug into the rear-side port, the one that was working semi-right, my USB-C power meter reads 0.13A coming down and stabilizing around 0.08A, instead of the 0.04 that it was reading earlier. I have made no changes to the board since my last post when it was reading 0.04A, no clue what changed.\n\nThank you for your time!"
