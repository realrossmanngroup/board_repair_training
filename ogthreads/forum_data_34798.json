[URL=\"https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/33982-820-3787-no-audio-output-or-input-bluetooth-sound-works\"]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards...th-sound-works[/URL]\n\nThat issue is fixed but now I am having issues with a row of keys that are not working. \"zxcvbnm,.\" those keys are not working and I plugged in another new keyboard of mines and the same keys on that one didn't work either. When I plugged in a usb keyboard those keys were registering from usb keyboard.\nI've done an SMC and PRAM reset already.\n\nAlso the keyboard backlight is not turning on in the OS even though I am to toggle the keyboard backlight from the keyboard but no light appears on the keyboard.\n\nI've removed the SSD and booted into my OS on a USB stick but that didn't solve the issue either."
