Same model but completely different machine.\n\nI performed a detailed inspection of J9500. Looked perfect. I checked every pin on top and bottom.   Pushed on each one on bottom checking for possible bad solder connections.  It is absolutely perfect.  No corrosion of any kind. Pins all looked good.\nI am using the ribbon that was with this machine so it is a different one than last time. This tester machine worked perfect.\n\nAbout this Mac\nBuilt-in Speaker\nBuilt-in Line Output\nIntel High Definition Audio\n\nNO SOUND!\n\n1.5v PP1V5_S0SW_AUDIO\n3.3v AUD_PWR_EN\n\n(tests performed with no ribbon)\n\nSPKRAMP_INR_N\nSPKRAMP_INR_P\n\nI take it these are the data lines to the on board Right speaker?\n\nAre the HDA lines for the sound chip? I am a little lost here.\nIf it detects the audio card it must use different lines for sending data to it than seeing it.\nPerhaps I have a hung data line. Not sure what to trouble shoot."

This is a macbook I already fixed that uses the same board.\n\nI was asking what data lines are for Sound board detection and what ones carry the data back and forth. I don't have a schematic for the DC-IN board. I guess I can look at one and pull a data sheet on the sound IC, Trace it back.\n\nI should get a logic analyzer for strange stuff like this. Would be interesting to compare.  Back in the day when working on arcade machines a Logic analyzer helped me fix so much stuff it was crazy.   I couldn't live with out one."
