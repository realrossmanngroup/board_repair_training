            "message": "This Macbook came in with customer stating they had powering/charging issues with one of the ports, now it won't power from both USB-C. After replacing both CD3217 chips and still getting 5V 0.016A I checked the surrounding caps around them and found CF400/CF500 PP3V3_S2 low at .560V. On further inspection I found a burnt coil L8300 which I replaced with a 30Ohm coil (all I had similar) to get 3.7V from PP3V8_AON_VDDMAIN to U8100 MPMU_BSTLQ_LX. Power was briefly at 5V 0.450A but has dropped to 5V 0.016A and I'm not sure where to look next."
