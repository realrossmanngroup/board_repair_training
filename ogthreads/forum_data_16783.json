When I plug my chargers in I get no light at all and no fan spin even after plugging in a know good io board/cable. On the board I see some probe points that look discolored but I don't see any corrosion anywhere nor any damaged components so I can't say for sure there was liquid damage. A few of those discolored probe points were around the SMC and ISL6259 and other places.\nThere is no voltage on PP3v42_g3h or PPbus_g3h and no short to ground on either of those lines. Here are some other measurements I took on the DCIN line.\n\nR7010 and Pins 1/2 of J7000 - fluctuates from 0.19v-0.47v\nR7010 in diode mode - 0.70v - Resistance 100kohms\n\nR7005 0v on both sides and no short to ground\n\nI don't have a fake chinese charger to test and see if it turns on with it."
