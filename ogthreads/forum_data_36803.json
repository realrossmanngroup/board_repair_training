            "message": "Ok so I'm stumped, and I'm sure it may be something dumb I'm overlooking, but this board came in with liquid around the SMC, clock chip, and a backlight chip. Cleaned areas of corrosion no problem nothing concerned me that much. Currently getting no light on the charger and R7020 is on fire. I removed it and the diode to 3v42 to check for a short on input. I got no short but said what the hell and replaced the 3 input caps and 3v42 regulator to be safe. R7020 remains on fire. I next thought possibly Q7080 and the ISL could be causing it so removed both and still no change R7020 on fire. What else can be causing this resistor to burn? No short on 3v42 or PPVIN_PP3v42_G3H. No short on PPBUS. I'm out of ideas all help is appreciated."
