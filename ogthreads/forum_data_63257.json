            "message": "This board has me stumped. It came from an A1707 15\u201d machine with a battery issue (I believe it had the wrong battery connected to it, or its battery connector was shorted).\n\nThe board was stuck at 5V USB-C. I found a short on PP3V3_G3H which I traced to a shorted SMC. I replaced the SMC, which restored PP3V3_G3H to 3.3V and SMC_PM_G2_EN to 3.4V.\n\nNow when I plug in a charger cable, the USB-C port initially stays as 5V and after 10-15 seconds jumps to 20V. I\u2019ve never seen a delay this long; I\u2019m sure it means something.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is not being generated, even with 20V on PPDCIN_G3H. I replaced U7000 (ISL9239) with no change.\n\nCurrent sensing resistors R7021/22 are fine. CD3215 LDOs are all fine."

Obviously, the SMC could not communicate with U7000.\n\nI found diode D6950 shorted to ground and replaced it. This restored the SMC data lines, PPBUS, and PP3V3_S5.
