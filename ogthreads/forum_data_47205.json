The other side stays steady at 5V. PPBUS is at 12.3V. LDO voltage is coming up to 3.4V and PP3V3_G3H is also coming up to 3.4V. I haven't been able to find any shorts. Not sure how these 4 ports are divided where one side is having an issue the other side isn't."

            "message": "As different as this board is from the older ones, the CD3215 areas are laid-out almost identically so I think the 820-00239 is pretty accurate there. Diode measurements are all the same at around .180. Slightly higher than the older boards.\nI'm guessing PPBUS should be 13V and yes, this is an SMC-related issue. Board is not turning on with either side plugged in. I don't see CHGR_ACOK in the 00239 schematic and I still can't find SMC_RESET_L. There's nothing that's standing out yet. The SMC area is very different. Those SMC_RESET_L pads are gone."
