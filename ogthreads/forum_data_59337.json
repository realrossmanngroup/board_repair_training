            "message": "Hi all,\n\nThis is my first board repair, I am not a professional and just a hobbyist.  Possibly some typos as I am going off my written notes from a week ago.\n\nHistory:\nCorona free macbook.\nI was gifted the machine.  It had a bullet hole through the screen and was crusty with dirt and pubes on the inside.  Cleaned up nicely, no obvious corrosion.  I spend an hour examining under the magnifying glass before I cleaned it up, after testing.\n\nI have the screen if anyone wants to see a pic of the hole (bullet hole to be clear).\n\nBoard symptom:\nQuater fan spin, no vcore.  some voltages pulsing with the fan (see further down)\n\nWhat I have done:\nI replaced C1724 +1723 and R7005.  I measured the resistor incorrectly, but I did a passable replacement job, not completely new to soldering and heat gun work.  Essentially replaced as I am a moron.\n\nMeasurements:\nPPBUS_S5_HS_Computing - 12.6v (good?)\nCPU Vcore - dead, no pulsing with the fan.\nAll_sys_PWRGD - Pulses with fan spin.\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU - Dead\nPPVCORE_SO_AXG - Dead\nPP1V2-S3_ENET_INTR - Pulses with fan.\nPP1V05_S0 - Pulses with Fan\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.48V\nPPBUSG3H - 12.6V\nPP3V3_S5 - 3.32V\nPPVCCSA_S0_CPU - Dead\nPP1V8_S0 - Pulses on fan spin\nPP5VS3 - Pulses on fan spin\n\nI Probably over measured, but I wanted the practice on the book of mac.\n\nAssumption (probably wrong - noob):\nThinking I need to concentrate on U2800 or U7400 any ideas how I test these better?\nU7000 I see 3.1 ohms between 17 & 18 i did see elsewhere that it probably should be 2.2ish.\n\n\n\nNeed tips on where I go next, please.  I really am a noob at this.\n\nThanks\nDQ from Australia."

            "message": "Hi, you were right [USER=682]@2informaticos[/USER] .  My initial measure of PPVCCSA_S0_CPU was a regular spike with the fan, with my crappy multimeter was reading a 1.5vish spike with the fan.\n\nDiode mode to ground on L7100 gives me 0.016 \n\nCaveat; I need better optics, I have a magnifying glass with a light, but I have something better on the way.  Nothing like what the pros use though, but it should give me better vision.\nU7100 \nPin 7 - VCCSAS0_SREF - pulses to about 1.5 . again a slow multi.\nPin 15 - PVCCSA_EN - Looks like it pulses to about 3.8\nPin 19 - PP5V_S0_VCCSAS0_VCC - Pulses 80-100mv and over and then slowly (ish) drops back to 0 before the next pulse, again.\nPin 20 - PP5VS0 - Pulses with the fan and drains.  Again seeing about 90mv on average.\n\nAnd thanks.."
