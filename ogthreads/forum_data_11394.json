I was looking for the actual chip. \nthat was just a drip of flux. \nthe original issue with this board was no power caused by liquid damage. after corrosion was cleaned up and the board was ultrasonic'd nothing looked toasted and the computer was working fine, got back to customer for 2 weeks and the lcd would no long show backlight. reinstalled graphics drivers, made sure brightness was setup up to full. tested in PE disk. with the computer powered off i did un plug and re plug in the lcd with the battery also plugged in. Which in retrospect i know is never a good idea. but it was having this issue before disassembled. \n\nBecause of the previous liquid damage i assumed that something had gone on the board. But it definitely can be an lcd issue also.\n\nthe computer does still power on and function normally just with no backlight. \n\nIncluded picture of kbc area cleaned up.\n\n[url]http://imgur.com/a/vAis3[/url]\n\nI really appreciate all the help."
