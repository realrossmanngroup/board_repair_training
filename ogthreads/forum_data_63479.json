No sign of life.\nThe voltage from the adapter is stuck at 5V.\n\nThe voltage PP3V3_S2_UPC on the USB-C Port Controller is missing, but the port doesn't have any short circuits nor does the board.\nI see it's coming from PMU: Master LDO (U8100).\nPP3V8_AON_MPMU_ISNS_VIN on it IS THERE, but PP3V3_S2_UPC is NOT THERE.\n\nAny idea what I can do? Is this the actual problem?"
