For cosmetic reasons no one was interested and they piled up, to the point I wanted to recycle them.\n\nBut, I left one out in the sun on my terras during 2 hours and I noticed it got white again.\nI \u201cbleached\u201d my stock this way.\n\nAttached you can see the effect of one side in the sun for 2 hours and the original yellow other side.\n\nI do not know how long this patch works, but seems stable after 3 weeks.\n\nSo get out, get some sun and take your chargers with you!\n\nEsmon\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60662[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60663[/ATTACH]"
