Don't have the LVDS connectors in stock anymore, but maybe someone has a clue going from the voltage alone?"

What could be the reason for the fuse to blow? I'm new to this stuff (for some reason, havent had almost any backlight issues in so far, only like 5 and they were easy) and trying to learn!"
