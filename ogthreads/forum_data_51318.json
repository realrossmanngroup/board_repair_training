            "message": "Hi, I have an Air 3437 that came in with liquid damage, sometimes rebooting by itself but working. Some corrosion around R5100. Replaced R5100 (reset_l, maybe thats why it was rebooting sometimes), alsoY1915 had a tiny bit of corrosion under it, replaced it. I have orange and green light, the fan spins one time 12 seconds, reboots, and then keeps spinning high, no display. U6100 area looks OK no shorts and all R measure OK. I also have 32 on clockchip.\n\nThe board seems to have all power lines, CPU got 1.75 and 1.5 and Dram power is also there. I also have ALL_SYS_PWRGD. Tried SMS reset and Bypass, reset did nothing, bypass gives me super high fanspin but no boot. Mouse has a light on USB and I also have SMC_PM_G2_EN. I have 0v on PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT but both sides of the Fuse have 8.6v. Also missing is PP3V3_S0SW_LCD, no shorts on U8300, 3.3v_5S is there but no EDP_PANEL_PWR which comes from PCH. I have SMC_ADAPTER_EN as well as PM_BATLOW_L it seems SMC is running. Ideas?"

Sometimes just drop out and require a power cycle. I re-flowed the SMC and it started working normally so I sent it out. It came back a day later and had no green light. Replaced SMC and it worked perfect. I think my SMC was on the way out and re-flowing it just bought it time."
