            "message": "Got this board from a mbp retina with liquid spill. (Very little corrosion)\nDid some work on it: \nR5095 pad nr.2 was distroyed so I connected it to R5092. This worked, the machine would work for a day then it stopped working.\n\nHot rails are present. One wire circuit seems fine. Still no green green light. (only after I try the charger in another board and connect it back then I can get a green light one time).\nSuspected the SMC (after watching some Luis videos). I did reflow the SMC. Still nothing.\nAny advice?"
