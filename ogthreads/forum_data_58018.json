            "message": "Ok, so after some tinkering, unplugging things, plugging in things it seems I was able to at least figure out why I am not seeing an image but have not found a solution. after pulling the board, the board booted to ? folder, so I plugged in everything and powered it on, NO ? FOLDER! SO I unplugged everything, ? Folder came back. Started plugging stuff back in and testing and the culprit is something to do with the webcam connection. I confirmed with two other LCD panels and sure enough, every time I plugged in the camera cable, no more ? folder. Removed it and again, ? would show up. So my next problem is trying to figure out why the heck this connection causes the computer to not boot."
