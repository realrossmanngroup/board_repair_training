I replaced U7400 as it was getting hot. That is no longer getting hot but Im guessing it's cpu issue if PM_SLP_SUS_L is unstable? Following the power up sequence that is the first rail that appears to be unstable."

Yes pulses at L7700 that's how I discovered. \n\nBoard was liquid damage but not bad. worst areas were Q7065 and that seems to be working and U6500. I checked diode readings of Q7401 because it was near some signs and that seems ok."
