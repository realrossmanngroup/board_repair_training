            "message": "Hello Everyone,\n\nOne of my customers brought me a macbook air A2337 , board number 820-02016. When I plugged it in I can see that it stays around 5.170V and amp goes up to between 0.27 and 0.388 and back to zero again. And it is on a loop like this. When I measured the \nCF505 on  PP1V5_UPC1_LDO_CORE = 1.5V Stable,\nCF508 on PP3V3_UPC1_LDO = 3.5V Stable,\nCF500 on PP3V3_S2_UPC = up and down between zero and 0.2V but it goes up partly and goes donw again partly (I mean partly every 1 second it goes down to zero then goes up 0.1 then zero and 0.11 and back same way down from 02.V)\nCF402 on PP1V25_S2 = between zero and 0.5 (same as CF500)\nR8441 on UPC_PMU_RESET_3V3 = around zeroV\nCC337 on PP5V_S2 = 0.001V\nRF235 on UPC1_5V_EN = 0.13V\nRF901 on USBC1_3V3LDO_EN = 0.0V\n\nJust because of these I thought the problem is UF500 but do I miss something else or am I right? Want to check with you guys anyway.\n\nThank you for you help in advance.\n\nEmre"

So \u0131 took the board under thermal camera and gave 3.3V to that line and found shorted capacitor. Moved it away. Put the LC710 back measured it again and Yay no shorts anymore and back to live."
