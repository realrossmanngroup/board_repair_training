            "message": "Hello there!\n\nSo here's the deal - I'm not a shop but upgraded anyway to get a swift and useful answer on this. :)\n\nI have an old Macbook Pro which has a strange issue and I haven't seen this discussed on the YouTube channel so I'll try to describe the symptoms:\n\n- The device powers on sometimes (typically after a long period of not being used.)\n- The device does NOT power on every time on battery.\n- The device does NOT power on every time on AC either.\n- Disconnecting the battery for a long time (a week or two) and then reconnecting it almost always revives the laptop until it goes to sleep at which point it will sometimes turn back on again when opening the lid but typically will refuse to work for a while again.\n\nRemedial action so far:\n\n- Replaced the battery completely - this resulted in it working right away making me think it was resolved. Put it to sleep overnight, didn't wake up again the next morning.\n- Replaced the AC adapter both with the same adapter model *and* with a spare 85W adapter I had laying around - no difference.\n\nI do have a multimeter so am happy to test points on the board if that helps but right now I'm at a loss where to even start.\n\nThanks!"
