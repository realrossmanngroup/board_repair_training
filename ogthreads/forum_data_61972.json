            "message": "Hello. Got this board here. UB300 was boiling hot, so I replaced it. When I removed the chip PAD number 4 was ripped off, so I ran a jumper wire through it. Some other pads have been ripped, they are 7 and 8, but no big deal, since pins 6 and 18 which are connected to them are integer and conducting well. No I get 5V on all ports, but all of them except the one I replaced UB300 is drawing around 250mA from charger. UB300 negotiates 5V but draws 0A from charger. I have no visible blown components and no shorts I could find. Any ideas?"
