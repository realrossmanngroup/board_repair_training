Cannot see any oxidation on the board. \n\nAfter clean, all work well, however, when started there is no keyboard or trackpad detected.\nUSB both works fine. Also, the power button on the keyboard seems to be working too. \n\nDisconnected each one by one to check the other. Both are not working. \nTried to swap the board into another case with the same keyboard, the keyboard still doesn't work.\n\nAny advice what shall I measure first?"
