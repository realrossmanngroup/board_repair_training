            "message": "Follow up to a previous post:\n-------\nHello all,\nSo I have an 820-3332 that had it's screen break off. The client still used it for a few months until it started to cut in and out (no hinges to support it). I received a replacement lvds cable but still no image. Checked on our ol friend and Mr. Shoe rubber was installed... So he got new solder and looks great now, but still no image.\n\nWhat would be the next course of action, what would a shorted lvds line potentially do?\n\nUnfortunately, I do not have a test screen to see if this one was damaged from not being structurally connected for so long.\n--------\nI had a test screen that was cracked pretty badly, but when hooking it up, backlight came on and i saw some blinking after a few seconds - the folder with a question mark.\n\nI ordered a replacement screen from my normal vendor, and it is not working.\n\nThe screen has no backlight at any time. If i shine a light through the apple, its pitch black when turned on and gradually will let light through. But no image of any sort.\nHooking it up to an external monitor, it works fine.\n\nI am working on finding another test screen- i actually asked the client that had that cracked one if i could borrow it again (he wants it for an art project) so i wont know till then if that screen is magical or if i got a dud.\n\nWhat should i test or do in the mean time?\n\nThanks all!"
