At first, there's image but no backlight, i tried to change lp8550 a few times but suddenly there's no display anymore, but macbook still turn on, connect to external video is working fine, so looks like not an gpu issue\nPpvout_s0_lcdbklt is 0v\nLcd_power_en 0v\nI got 12.6 on both side of F7700\nPin 2 3 4 7 of lvds connector is 3.3v"
