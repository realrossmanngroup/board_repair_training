If PP3V3_G3H had a short circuit, but the board stays at 5V and PP3V3_G3H is still missing, it can be due to R7900 (0 Ohm Resistor between PP3V3_G3H_RTC and U7800 PMIC, that takes PP3V3_G3H_RTC input and outputs it as PP3V3_G3H). Short cuircuit on PP3V3_G3H can burn out R7900 (may be visually intact). Check R7900 resistance. ...\"\n\nworking now \nproblem solved"
