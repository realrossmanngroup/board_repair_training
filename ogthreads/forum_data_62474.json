But this is my first post so excuse me if not good.\n\nGot a liquid damaged 820-01949 Was already been played with. Found a ISL9239 on the board in stead of a ISl9240. Replaced it off course with a new ISL 9240. But still no PPBUS_G3H. What is needed for u7000 to create PPBUS_g3h?\n\nPlease advice where to look. \n\nMeasurements:\n\nPPBUS_G3H 1v\nPP3v3_g3h 3,3V\n\nUSB-C 5V 0,049A.\n\nThanks in advance."
