Then I removed R8998,R8999,C8961,C8962,C8963,C8964 GPU is not warming so GPU is dead ? And now also machine can not power on is it normal ( not fan spin and another thing about working) ?\nif GPU is not get power machine cant turn on?"

And when i removed r8999 and r8998 short to ground stay another side (at PPVCORE_S0_GFX_REG line) so if q8930 and 8931 was shorted groun when i removed this resistors it have to stay short to ground is it correct or i know some things wrong?"
