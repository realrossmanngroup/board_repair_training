I've restored endless voltages to this very wrecked board and it boots with everything functioning normally now expect the trackpad and keyboard are unresponsive. No caps lock light. I'm comparing the circuits to a known-good board pulled from a computer with a cracked screen and I can't find any difference in voltage or diode measurements. Any thoughts on good places to look next?"
