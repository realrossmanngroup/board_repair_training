            "message": "Hello,\n\nI've got here 820-3787 that turns on to a questionmark folder with known good drives (with High Sierra installed and running on different machine). It will also not find any wifi network in boot selection menu. USB is fully functional. \n\nI bought this machine with no video issue, but that was just L8300 killed by bad LVDS cable - after changing those two things, it worked well. However the screen was in bad shape, so I ordered a new one. After changing the screen it stopped booting from SSD (just questionmark folder, even with known good drives), so I tried to do an internet recovery, but that immediately gave me 1005F error (even after PRAM/SMC reset), so the wifi also doesn't work. I think it's a PCIe issue, probably caused by bad camera in that new screen assembly. However I also changed SSD at once with the screen and the resistance measurements on camera connector are the same as on known working one, so I'm not certain what caused this issue and if the camera is really defective. The board looks pristine, no spills, oxidation, missing parts, signs of previous repairs or anything like that. I only found a little solder ball next to U3711, so I changed it just to be sure, but that did not solve anything. I also changed U1900, no progress.\n\nI've got here another A1398 with 820-3787 that is fully working, so I can compare my measurements. \n\nAll the rails are present and stable, including these: \n\nPP1V8_CAM\nPP1V35_CAM\nPP1V2_CAM\nPP3V3_S3RS0_CAMERA\nPP3V3_WLAN\nPP3V3_S0SW_SSD_FLT\n\nCAM_PCIE_RESET_L\nTBT_PCIE_RESET_L\n\nAP_CLKREQ_Q_L\nSSD_CLKREQ_L\n\nCAM_CLKREQ_L is low, but that should appear after successful boot to OS according to the other machine (?)\n\nThese components are not shorted and looks pristine:\n\nCAM\nC4030 - C4033\nC4061\nC4062\n\nAP\nL3501\nSSD\nC3710 - C3717\n\nTBT\nC2800 - C2807\nC2840 - C2847\n\nI've already seen this issue on different 3787/3662, but there was always some bad cap... on this one I don't know what else to look for :(\n\nThank you"

Also I sold the original SSD before the new LCD came to me and there was El Capitan installed, while all the drives I tested had High Sierra with APFS.\n\nIt's unbelieveable that you were able to solve it with so much misleading informations.
