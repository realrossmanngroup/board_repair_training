Things i replace LCD connector /u9701 tried two different screens / replace resistors around u9701 check diode mode all good reading and even replace R7402/R7403 from u7400 and u7400  and over kill still all the same even did pram reset  and smc lid is working any help is needed maybe i miss some thing or i may have left out something i did and forgot to write it on this post  thanks."
