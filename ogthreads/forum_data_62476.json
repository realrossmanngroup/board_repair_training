            "message": "Hi, i have no experience with macbook boards. \nThe board works perfectly with battery, if battery goes down, never power on. \nIf i disconnect battery and i release all residual electricity from the board the mac power on with the charger and works perfectly, even if i connect the batery now, the battery starts charge ok, and all works ok. But if i disconnect the power adapter and connect again stop working, no light, on charger.\nSo summarizing:\nWith battery works ok but no charging\nWithout battery: i must release residual electric or wait about 5 minutes or shorcut the main 14.5v -> plug in charger, and works. If i disconnect the charger, and plug in again no works till release the residual electricity, and i dont have any voltage on connector or main rail."
