But still PPVCORE_S0_CPU_VCCAXG stays to 0V.\nI would supspect more the PCH U1800 than the SMC no?\nIf yes do you know the right reference of the PCH (U1800) , because i couldn't find the PCH on ebay with the ref in the pdf : \" INTEL PANTHER POINT - MPCH U1800 1017P \" or \" QP8D-MM915462 \"\n\nthanks"
