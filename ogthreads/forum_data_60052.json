It chimes now and I have CPU activity mouse flashing. but no display I\u2019m missing J9000 ( pin 3 0v, pin 4 3.3v) LCD_PWR_EN 0v at U9000 and SMC_LID is 3.4v L9080, r9008, r9009, L9004 all measure good so I\u2019m guessing the lcd isn\u2019t being \u201cseen\u201d I\u2019m using a b133ew07 test screen and a \u201cnew\u201d screen cable. if I remember the screen is from a 2010 MacBook Pro so I\u2019m guessing this set up should work if I\u2019m wrong let me know."

Ball size should indeed be marked on the stencil, you can't use a random stencil, only stencil for 6/7 series mobile chipset will line up.\nIf you have a decent BGA rework station you can buy pre-balled PCH and solder it lead-free. Will save your time and sanity."

I\u2019m not sure this is correct but on pin 458 of u1800 I have a dead 0.00v short I removed (R2465, R2460, C2465,C2466,C7781,u7800) on this line and on u7800 Pin 1 (PP1V05_S0_PCH_VCCADPLL)\nI still have a dead short. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s directly from PCH. So I\u2019ll go ahead and replace :) thank you 2informatico and piernov"
