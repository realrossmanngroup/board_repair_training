            "message": "Hi everyone, I'm stumped here. \n\nLiquid damage around U7330 and battery connector. Replaced corroded capacitors around U7330, got the board to power on then will not enter S4. Then noticed area between Q7155 and battery connector very hot. PPVBAT_G3H_CONN shorted to ground. Removed Q7155, no change.\n\nRails are\nPPBUS_G3H 12.55V\nPP3V42_G3H 3.42V\nPPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS 12.55v\nPPVIN_S5_HS_OTHER3V3_ISNS 12.56v\nPPVIN_S5_HS_OTHER5V_ISNS 12.55\nPP3V3_SUS 3.34V\nPP3V3_S5 3.34V\nPP3V3_S3 0!\nPP3V3_S0 0\nPP5V_S5 5.04V\nPP5V_S4 0\nPP5V_S3 0\nPP5V_S0 0      \nPP3V3_S4 0.45v                                                                                                               \nPP3V3_SUS 3.34\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.34\nPM_SLP_S4_L 0v\n\nThanks"
