            "message": "Hello, I have a 820-00923 No power. I looked the board over and found corrosion near U3100. I had no PP3v3_G3H but I removed corroded capacitor and got 3.3V on PP3V3_G3H. The problem is I plug in the charger to every single port and it takes 5v, 30-50 milliamps, and turns off. And the cycle repeats. For the 3 seconds its on, PP3V3_G3H is 3.3V. Right before it turns off, PPDCIN turns to 19.89V before turning off again. I replaced Q3100 as it had a bit of corrosion on it. Pin 4 of Q3100 goes to a test point that was corroded and is completely gone. However, this test point is not on the boardview. I have also replaced U2890 from a donor, and still no luck. Any ideas?"
