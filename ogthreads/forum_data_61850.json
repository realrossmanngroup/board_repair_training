            "message": "Hi guys, we sold this mac 6 month ago to trusted client.\nThe machine was before used in our store for almost one year without issues. Never repaired before...\n\nAnyway... \nNo post, No usb activity ,machine turns on , green and amber light , no fan spin but I assume that is normal on this model.\nALL_SYS_PWRGD drop to low once and then says high. Cpu get warm after a while.\nFan goes high speed on SMC bypass but nothing happens.\n\nI checked all the SPI lines and all resistors and everything is OK.\nAlso tried a good bin file and another chip from same model of donor board.\nNo signs of liquid damage or whatsoever... Everything seems in good shape.\n\nAny clues?"
