CPU is getting warm however. Any suggestions on where to start checking this one as i'm at a loss i've not seen this kind of problem before which was not caused by a spill!\n\nUpdate - Considered this one has a dead CPU thread is now referring to the board with problems described in post #6"

There could be corrosion under the CPU or there could be a memory failure.  If it does not properly load bios and move on it will do this.\n\ncheck your 3V3 SUS, make sure your bios chip is getting power.  If you have thermal look at out booting.   When the CPU loads bios and starts it's cycle you can see the RAM chips flash with activity.  Make sure your 25Mhz clock is alive."

I've tried a clean bios posted on the forum for this board but still nothing no display. Are we looking at a dead CPU?\nI should add I checked for voltage on the 25mhz and 32khz pins out of u1900 and they appear to be there (I don't have a scope but voltage there)\n\nAssuming that this board has a dead CPU we can consider it scrap.\n\nI have another 820-00165 which again appears clean but is stuck in S5 power state - orange light on charger. PM_SLP_S4_L missing reads 0v - I was toying with the idea of swapping u1900 on this one although it does seem to be producing an output on pin 12 but nothing on pins 4 and 3. All other prerequisites for PM_SLP_S4_L appear to be present (PPVRTC_G3H, RTC_RESET_L, PCH_SRTCRST_L, PCH_INTVRMEN_L, PCH_DSWVRMEN_L, PP3V3_S5, PM_DSW_PWRGD, PP3V3_SUS, PM_BATLOW_L, PM_RSMRST_L)\nAny thoughts on this one?"
