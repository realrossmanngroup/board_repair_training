Is there a way to check if the battery we have is good? (we do have NLBA Battery analyzer)\n\nWould obviously make backup, unfortunately however i couldn't find another source for the DUMP, but do not want to buy REWAs special programmer just for the dump of this one chip.\n\nAny recommendations?"

            "message": "Thank you very much!\nIt was indeed the firmware chip itself (UF260), i tried reading it with both our XGecu Pro TL866II Pro and our RT809F, both would not identify it properly, and manually setting to the correct W25Q80DV setting revealed the content to be empty (all 0xFF) using a donorboards(820-00875-A) W25Q80DVUXIE (backed up the firmware just incase we might need it someday) and flashing the provided file worked great!\nIt now goes to 20V and boots up just fine.\nStill have the feeling some things are a bit wonky, but i suspect the empty battery to be the cause, so will keep it plugged in and charging on lockscreen for a bit.\n\nMany thanks again and a good day to you!\nBest regards"
