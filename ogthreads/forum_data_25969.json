            "message": "Hi there,\n\nFirst it had a typical gpu problems. Stuck on boot screen loading video drivers.\nDid a diagnostic reflow. Everything works good again. Changed GPU chip. Tested, ALL system parameters functional.\nA week later he comes back with other type of video problems: Straight after screen goes on, image is badly distorted (see pictures), after it loads video drivers goes to normal (not distorted) blank image and thenm sometimes boots to OS, sometimes restarts.\nPressing on Vram doesnt help.\nWierd, I have never seen these type of image distortions before. Could you advice on what that could be? \n\nThanks!"
