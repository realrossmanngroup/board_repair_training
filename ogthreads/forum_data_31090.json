Also pins 47/48 were a bit burned on U7400, which has been replaced. \n\n* If I took diode measurements on every pin of ISL and compared to working board, would that tell me anything. Or just that the ISL is OK?\n\nThanks Duke, have a good one."

            "message": "R7020 should have DCIN voltage, so the input FET is not opening. This could be an ISL issue the FET itself or traces/resistors. \nCheck all voltages to U7000 first, DCIN, VDD, VDDP. Check traces and resistors from AGATE and SGATE to Q7080. Check traces to Q7030/35, possibly replace them if in doubt.\n\nBut you could just connect a charged battery, the board should be able to power on from that if it is recognized. See if the battery indicator works, then the board should power on if you short the power pads. You can bridge battery main output to PPBUS and bypass Q7055 and the fuse, providing PPBUS is not shorted of course!"
