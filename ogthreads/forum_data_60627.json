            "message": "Hello,\n\nToday I'm working on a board that came back from a customer because it no longer works after about 3 days ...\n\nI cleaned the board so well that I no longer know what was repaired ... It seems that there was a short circuit on PP1V2_S3 because traces of soldering shows that I injected a voltage ... (The short  has been eliminated)\n\nPPBUS_G3H 8,5V\nPM_BATLOW_L 3,3V\nSMC_RESET_L 3,3V\nSMC_PM_G2_EN 3,3V\nSMC_ONOFF_L 3,4\nPM_PWRBTN_L 3,3V\nRTC_RESET_L 3,3V\n\nPCH_DSWVRMEN 3,15V (normal ?)\nPCH_INTVRMEN 3,15V (normal ?)\n\nPM_SLP_S5_L = 0V\nPM_SLP_S0_L = 0V\nPM_SLP_SUS_L = 0V\nPP3V3_SUS 0V\nPM_RSMRST_L 0V\n\nWhen I try to turn on, the PM_SLP_S5_L  pulses up to 3.3v and falls back.\nThe board does not start in smc bypass.\n\nPM_RSMRST_L 0v is most likely caused by PP3V3_SUS 0v.\nWho is responsible for PP3V3_SUS?\n\nThanks in advance"
