            "message": "This A2337 Air came in \"water-damaged\", but the only evidence of liquid exposure was on the USB-C plugs, which were badly corroded. With a fresh USB-C board, the machine chimes but only shows a blank screen (backlight is on). On an external display, the screen flashes on and off, showing the cursor on a black background. Intermittently, the machine will display and attempt startup and I've gotten it to load Recovery Assistant once (and verified that the machine does not have activation lock).\n\nI've tried A DFU Restore, which successfully ended in a padlock on the host (but no video on the target Mac). \n\nDo you have a BIN file for reflashing the SoC ROM?"

But on the next restart, the display reverted back to black. When I unplug the internal screen, I get an external display image but it comes and goes at random intervals (sometimes displaying for several seconds, then disappearing and reappearing). Interestingly, it shows the internal display as connected even though I unplugged it, see below. Could this be a GPU issue?"
