After removing U9580 short on PPBUS_G3H is gone, and have 20V on ampmeter, and 0.27A, but still no power on.\n\nP2V5_SW2_TPS62180_SSD0 (on L9581) has 0.001 on diode reading, but I don't  know if it is because I've removed U9580.\n\nCan you help?\n\nI don't have any other A2141 board to replace U9580.\n\nCan I use other mac board model to get this U9580?\n\nTKS"
