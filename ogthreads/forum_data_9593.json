            "message": "Hi. I got one more MacBook Pro 15 Late 2013 which shuts down intermittently again. \n\nIt has exact same symptoms when shutting down as this one: [url]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/7110-820-3662-intermittent-shut-down[/url]\n\nCan work for long time (several hours) or short time (under five minutes) then suddenly image disappears but backlight stays on for 10-20 seconds and then machine turns off. \n\nIt it is now second time I see this model with exact same issue. I tried switching the board to a complete working machine and it  still crashes. Thus it must be some logic board issue. I have also inspected for corrosion as last time but did not find anything. This time it wasn't even dusty or anything. Very clean and nice looking. Shiny pads everywhere and so on. \n\nIt happens very sporadically but it is like when it first starts crashing then it happens more frequently until I leave it alone for some time. After coming back to it it works for quite long time and then suddenly BOOM - no image - but light in Apple - 20 seconds pass by - machine turns off.\n\nI now now wonder if this issue is going to show up even more times on these models in the future. \n\nAny help appreciated as I still got the first one lying around. Maybe they got the same error. \n\nThanks."
