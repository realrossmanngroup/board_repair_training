            "message": "This board had a displaced pin 21 on J9500 for 3V42. Resoldered that and MagSafe light came back on. Checked all other pins. They're good. Board has CPU and all other voltages that I can find but no video. Has SMC_LID. When I plugged in an external keyboard to try PRAM reset, the light on the keyboard cycles every 2 or 3 seconds. So it seems like it's in some type of loop that I'm not familiar with. I'm attaching pre-cleaning board pics. I've check the SMC area and BIOS area and both are clean and showing good voltages and diode measurements. Can't find any shorts. Not sure what this could be."

SMC area looks really clean. I thought this was going to be an SMC issue when I had vcore and no post, but I think the problem is elsewhere. Not sure what else would cause something like this. Something is causing it to cycle."
