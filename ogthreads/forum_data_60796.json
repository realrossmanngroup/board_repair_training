            "message": "Arrived with heavy liquid damage from being left out in the rain but surprisingly the board has very little corrosion.\n\nminor corrosion around Q3200 area. Replaced Q3200 and a few capacitors but no changes. No 5v on charger\n\nOn pins 2 and 4 of Q3200 I get .200V  Checked all big coils and no shorts. First board we received without the amp meter at least coming on\n\nWhat should be checked next?"
