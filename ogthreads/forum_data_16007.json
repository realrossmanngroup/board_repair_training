I did not perform any repair yesterday. All voltages are present at U6900 and U6901. All I did yesterday was to remove and re-solder a resistor near ISL, resistance measurements on ISL, and some voltage readings.\nOnly peculiar thing with this board is a 0 Ohm resistor connecting the ground pads of the capacitors on CHGR_VDDP and CHGR_LGATE, that seems to have been added as an after-thought but in the factory. This is the one I removed then put back.\n\nOh and at some point today SMC was getting warm. Not hot. [/B]"

If the data line between the two is intact, meaning not shorted to ground, then 99% SMC is bad or is not being told to turn on properly. What do you get on SMC_RESET_L? SMC_RESET_L has to be 3.4v for the SMC to turn on and work, but should take a short period of time to rise after PP3V42_G3H stabilizes."
