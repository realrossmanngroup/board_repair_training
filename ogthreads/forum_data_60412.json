Board is perfectly clean, no corrosion, no liquid, no burnt components. After plugging charger in, there is green and orange light, but no fan spin. \n\n- PPBUS is stable 8,59v, \n- I have all S5 rails. \n- PM_SLP_S4_L and PM_SLP_S3_L are pulsing, the same ALL_SYS_PWRGD and S0 rails - I get CPU VCORE and PP_1V05_S 0 for half a second, then second time and later no pulse.\n- current sense resistors are ok\n- no corrosion on J6100\n- I have removed U6410 - no results,\n\nNothing gets hot, CPU and PCH have good resistance. I have tried known good BIOS, but it gives no difference. In SMC bypass mode fan spins once and stops."

I thought it's BIOS I have used just for testing (known good for this board), so I flashed it with original one. This time I got RTC reset (fan spin-stop-spin) and it was working like this for about 15 seconds, CPU got warm. Then it turned off. I've replugged charger, there was no fan spin this time but CPU VCORE and other S0 rails were present again, CPU got warm. Now it's dead again, only twice pulsing.."
