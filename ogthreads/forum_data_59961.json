            "message": "Another liquid damaged macbook in today this one 820-00875A. Was a lot of liquid damage focussed around keyboard connector. Keyboard connector was burned and has been replaced. Board has been Ultrasonic'd for 4 minutes. The issue is the machine won't start, the S5 3.3V and 5V rails just pulse when charger is connected, PPBUS is stable at 13V and if a battery is attached it wont take power/charge. Charger negotiates correctly to 20v. \n\nSeeing no activity on any S4 rails - i've checked 3.3v and 5v S4, S3 and S0 rails for shorts and found none.\n\nPP1V_S5G is reading 105ohm to ground, it is also pulsing but voltage is not going very high (up to 0.1V or so)\n\nI've checked all big coils on the board for shorts and also found nothing only L7410, L7420, L7430, L7210 and L7220 are showing 3ohm to ground and L7960 50ohm to ground but I think this is normal if someone could confirm."
