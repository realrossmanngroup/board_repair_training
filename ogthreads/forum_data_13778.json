            "message": "Okay I made this topic a few weeks ago and I fixed the backlight and sent it out. The customer has sent this back saying the backlight will only turn on after like 10 or times of turning the machine on and off. I have the machine back and there is no backlight and I can see when I flash a light on the screen.\n\nThis was the previous topic I created [url]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/12250-solved-820-3209-no-backlight-no-feedback-continuity[/url]\n\nThe backlight voltage from LCD connector shows from 7.49v to 8.36v. In diode mode Pin 2 of D9701 and C9799 show 0.599v.\n\nTo fix this board I scratched a little next to A5 feedback ball put some solder there and ran a wire to Pin 2 of D9701.\n\nShould I try putting a new LP8550 on the board?"

When I plug it in and measure pins 3/4 of LCD Connector I still get 8.35 and diode output is 0.591v.\n\nAlso, BKL_EN on its probe point measured around 2.78v.\n\nUpdate: I believe the issue here is BKL_PWM. I checked the voltage on it and it was showing around 0.14v to 0.80v.\nI then checked the resistance with no power and it showed around 1 Mega ohm so I replaced R9704/C9704. Now it is showing 0v so I ran a wire from BKL_EN(R9715) to BKL_PWM(R9704/C9704) then both of them showed 0v and in diode mode I get a 0v drop to ground on Pin 2 of R9704.\n\nNew measurements:\nDiode mode (D9701) - 0.52v\nR9704(BKL_PWM) - 0v\nVoltage mode Pins 3/4 LCD connector - 0v\nL9701 (1/2) - 0v\nU9000(Pin 1) - 3.21v"

If there is corrosion under the PCH that could explain this. When you measure voltage, use the probe point on the board and see what you get. But before jumping to the PCH, double check the entire board and see if there are any signs of damage such as burned or red probe points."
