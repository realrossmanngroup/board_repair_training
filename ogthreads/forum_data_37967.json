            "message": "Hi All,\n\nI have a 820-3437, Liquid spilled.\nThe repair all went ok. The board is alive, except i cant get it to load a OS.\n\nMost of the stuff i get these days is from other repair shops, so naturally, someone has already swapped the bios out completely before it was sent to me.\nThe board passes ASD EFI, but fails to load any of the graphics tests in MRI or even ASD OS.\n\nI'm sure the issue is a bad ME region, (unless someone knows otherwise). The issue is, i cant find a bios with cleanme that works. I tried quite a few but still no luck.\n\nDuke had posted one, but that link no longer works.\nSo anyone has a working cleanme from a 820-3437 that works ?\n\nthanks"
