I track down the problem to u7000, q7030, and q7035. replaced all, and magsafe green light come.\na few days later customer came back, no green light. i see ppbus is 12.2v. I have tried replacing smc 3 times.but still ppbus 12.2v and no green light. I test my smc to my sure working board and smc is good. so problem should be on board side.\ni noticed smc_bc_acok is low at 0.7v at u7000.\nits not shorted, diode mode is 0.473.\nso to sum up\nI have ppbus 12.2v\npp3v42 : 3.4v\nsmc_bc_acok 0.7v.\n\nu7000 got proper dcin 16v, acin 4v, vdd 5.1v, and vddp 4v.\nany pointer ? thanks..\nfor info, i have replaced u7000 a few times too, and quite sure its not the isl problem.\nthe whole board is kinda *not corroded,but oxidized. all probe point is dark."
