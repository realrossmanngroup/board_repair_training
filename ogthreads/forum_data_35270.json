            "message": "I have a customer who sends us ~5 boards/units per week. He told me that he sold a 2014 Mac Mini to a customer who brought it back several days later saying it wouldn't power on. They replaced the power supply on the unit (I'm unfamiliar with the Minis, as we don't typically service them, but am doing so as a favor for this customer). They made a point to say the customer was using the unit with \"external audio equipment\". They sold the customer a 2nd unit, and it, too, failed some days later. Customer brought it back, and they called me and asked if they could send them over because they suspected the damage could be caused by the customer. Understandable. They sent one unit over (so I haven't seen the 2nd unit, but they say the issue is identical--no power after the customer took it home for a few days).\n\nGot the unit broken down and immediately smelled electrical shorting/burning; figured it would be some amp or support for the audio circuit, but I actually found the GPU-face of the CPU had blown up--see image. This was a clean unit that had never ever been taken apart. Additionally, the case is clean (no signs of obvious drop, but who knows). I wanted to get your input to see what best to tell them. I'd like to see the 2nd unit, and if it has the same damage (very specific--face of GPU blown/cracked and clearly with burned resin/epoxy, etc), will know that yes it was very likely the customer's fault. I want to be certain, but have never seen external audio equipment cause a GPU to kill itself. I know that it (GPU) handles audio on this unit, so...seems like a pretty likely cause, but I want to be sure.\n\nAny ideas? Should I instruct them to send the 2nd unit over? Image attached, but in case it doesn't work, linked here as well: [URL]https://imgur.com/a/NkGLHOr[/URL]\n\nVery curious. Is there a way to know for sure what may have caused the damage, or should I just recommend they err on the side of caution and refuse repair/service to this customer?"
