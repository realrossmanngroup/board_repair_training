No more visible liquid or corrosion on board.\n\nCurrent issues - Loud Fan Spin + Slow / Laggy Operation \n\nEverything Else Works Fine.\n\nFrom what I can tell I need to run an \"MRI\" test as ASD is not available for the 2015 MacBook Airs to determine which sensor(s) are failing.\n\nUsing standard hardware test shows:\"may be an issue with smc - PFM006, may be an issue with power management system - PPN001\n\nHow can I run an \"MRI\" test?\n\nAny help is much appreciated - thank you!!"
