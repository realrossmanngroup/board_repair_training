            "message": "Hello,\n\nThe MBP is able to boot, load the OS, but the screen stays black.\nIf I plug an external monitor, I get an image. The keyboard and trackpad work properly.\n\nMeasurements on J8300 are:\n[LIST]\n[*]1.978V on pins 28-29-30.\nAs I get 5.00V on pin 1 of L8300, and 1.978V on pin 2 of L8300 & pins 28-29-30 of J8300, I assume that 1.978V is normal\n[*]0.7mV on pin 1 (PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT) which is not good at all\n[/LIST]\nI did a few more checks on:\nC7719 pin 1: 0.0mV,\nC7716 pin1: 0.0mV,\nC7717 pin1: 0.1mV,\nC7715 pin1: 0.1mV,\nC7718 pin1: 0mV\nD7701 pin1: 14.5mV, pin2: 0mV\nC7710 pin1: 12mV\nC7712 pin1: 13mV\n\nRegarding the fuse F7700, I do have 10.7V on both side, the schematics shows 12.6V. What is correct voltage of PPVIN_SO_LCD_BKLT ?\n\nI checked Q7706;\nOn pin 6,5,2,1 I read 19mV. It's too low.\nAfter the L7710, the PPBUS_SO_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW should be at 45V referring to the schematics;\nI would therefore expect something around 11V on pin1 of L7710 and pins 6/5/2/1 of Q7706\n\nOn the source of Q7706, pin 4, it reads 10.67V, and on the gate (pin 3) it reads 10.57V.\nQ7706 being a type P, power should go through, (10.57 < 10.67), and I should have 10.67V on the pins that have 19mV\n\nI also checked LCD_BKLT_EN on pin 1 of R7742, it shows 1.4mV, and BKLT_SD is at 10.47V\n\n\nAbove measurements taken while the MBP runs on battery.\n\nIf plugged, then:\nPPBUS_G3H is at 11.67V,\nL7130 pin1: 12.05V, pin2 11.8V\nJ8300: pins 28-29-30 unchanged at 1.978V, pin 1 at 3mV (should be ~45-50V)\nF7700: both side at 11.4V\nQ7706: On pin 6,5,2,1: 16.4mV, pin4 at 11.41V, pin3 at 11.32V. Q7706 is open\nR7742 pin1/2: 2.5mV\nBKLT_SD on pin11 of U7701 shows 11.32V\n\nAnyone to confirm that the Q7706 should be replaced ?\n\nPP5V_S0_BKLTCTRL is at 5.00V"
