            "message": "First of all, thanks for helping me with this.\n\nMy problem is the following:\n\nI have a 13-inch MacBook Pro 2017 without Touch Bar (the SSD in this model is not welded). I bought an SSD (512 GB) from eBay to change the one I had (128 GB). I opened the computer, but I forgot to disconnect the battery cable, made the SSD change and started the operating system. At first it went well but now the computer restarts on apple logo.\n\nI reset the NVRAM and also the SMC but it does not change anything.\n\nI can't boot in any mode (recovery, safe, verbose, single user) . Basically when the battery is connected to the motherboard, I can't do anything. But if I disconnect the battery cable from the motherboard, I can boot in any mode (recovery, safe, etc...) and of course in normal mode.\n\nThe weirdest of all this is the following:\n\n1) When the battery is connected and its at 5% or less, I can login but without plugging in the power cord and if I plug it in once logged in, the laptop will restart and return to the same thing as before.\n\n2) If I disconnect the laptop battery and start the system with the power cord, it works well.\n\n3) I have put back the old SSD but it happens exactly the same as with the new one.\n\n\nI can boot into diagnostic mode (with the battery connected and disconnected too), but it says that there's no problem.\n\nI boot in single-user mode (with the battery disconnected) and run fsck -f...its says that the volume appears to be ok...so I guess that the disk is not the problem....\n\nI reinstall macOS just a few hours ago...same story...the laptop restart. Its like a loop....apple logo, restart, apple logo, restart....But If I unplug the battery cable from the motherboard, I can login normally...\n\nI'm pretty sure that the battery is the problem here....but not physically...its something with the software...there must be some software(In the OSX, not third party) that handles the battery....\n\nI'm pretty sure that the battery has something to do with it....I don't know if something get fried when I changed the SSD and forgot to unplug the battery cable....but its very strange....I can use the Macbook pro normally without the battery cable connected to the motherboard (its connected to the AC) but if I run from the battery everything that I mentioned above happens...\n\nI dont know what's happening....\n\nAny help I will thank you very much!\n\nHere is a photo of the screen when I run in verbose mode with the battery connected to the motherboard:\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\tverbose_1.jpg Views:\t0 Size:\t439.7 KB ID:\t49647\"]49647._xfImport[/ATTACH][ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\tverbose_2.jpg Views:\t0 Size:\t423.7 KB ID:\t49648\"]49649._xfImport[/ATTACH][ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\tsingle_user_2.jpg Views:\t0 Size:\t428.4 KB ID:\t49650\"]49650._xfImport[/ATTACH]\n\nThank you!"
