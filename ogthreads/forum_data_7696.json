I see keyboard connectors available for purchase but no trackpad connectors. These melt if you try pulling one from a donor board. \n\nHate to see a perfectly good board go to waste because of a trackpad."

[/QUOTE]\n\nI am no expert but here is what I did just about 3 hours ago...\n\nOn a donor board, cover connector in flux, gently heat the other side of the board for a while till a large area of the board gets hot. Get closer in on the other side of the board, when you see the flux bubble a bit get right in there close. I like to gently nudge connectors rather than try to pull or lift them. It will just slide away when it want's to."

Once the solder has melted the connector will move since you are constantly applying pressure. This way you are not overheating it when the solder is already past the melting point. \n\nOr you could solder the trackpad cable to the board... which I've done several times for impatient customers. That's one way of doing a warranty sticker."
