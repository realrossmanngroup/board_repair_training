            "message": "Long story short: Purchased a new logicboard for a1466. Sent home with customer and they returned with an issue. It was going to sleep as she was typing on it. When they brought it back for my to diagnose it, I was still getting green to orange and was experience the same issue while typing. The computer would just randomly go to sleep. I changed out the dc in board and it was working fine on battery, but once i plugged in the charger, still no light, and it would go to sleep as soon as power hit it. changed to another dc in jack and it is working fine but no lights. I think its haunted."
