If I plug in headphones it switches to headphones and i can hear sound through them but when I unplug the headphones it goes back to digital optical output.\n\nI'm not sure if this is due to a chip not being on correctly but I think I soldered it on on correctly as I've done plenty of LP8550's but I have 1 more of these chips left so I don't want to use it yet if that isn't even the issue.\nI measured r6324 and it was only showing .22v on both sides even though the resistance measured fine. I replaced it along with r6323/ r6332 and now I get 3.3v on both sides of r6324.\n\nI also tried shorting pins 1 & 2 of the headphone socket to see if that would work as it did on a similar issue I had in the past but that didn't work either.\n\nI get 0v on both sides on L6607/08 with and without headphones plugged in. Diode mode of L6607 is 1.09v and on L6608 it is 0.61v\n\nI did a reflow on the U6201 chip but that didn't fix this. Also, I am getting a red light appearing from the headphone jack."
