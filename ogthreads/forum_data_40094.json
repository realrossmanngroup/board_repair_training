CPU Vcore 1.8v.\nFan spins normally for 10 seconds and then kicks in to overdrive. \nNo display or other signs of life.\nALL_SYS_PWRGD is present 3.4V. \nPLT_RESET_L  is high.\nNo light on USB device at all.\nResistance to ground at L7320 and L7310 17.5 ohms each.\nU1900 is getting proper power, as well as u6100.\n\nAny ideas where to start?"
