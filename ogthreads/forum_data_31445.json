I found a little friend right next to the SSD. The last time this machine was serviced was by the Apple at the there store!! They replace the whole board and I guess this screw was left dancing around.[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"30%\"]31446._xfImport[/ATTACH]\n\nI'll try to get this recognized by Apple but I guess I get their middle finger as they usually do.\n\nI hope my SSD is not completely toasted but first I need to revive the charging. Can this thing also killed the one wire circuit?. Maybe a fuse? Since I still don't have access to the schematics any help to narrow the issue greatly appreciated."

It's fixed and I did nothing, well, nothing that should fix the machine.\n\nFirst, you were right. The two screws were from one of the fans. While I was measuring PP3V42 in one of my tests... green light in the charger and boots. The only thing I did was to get the fan screws back and start testing. \n\nBefore I tried everything, disconnecting the battery, trying without the SSD, with the SSD... no charging light (and before the battery died could not find the SSD) It will remain a mystery. If this was caused by the dancing screw next to the SSD who knows.\nT"
