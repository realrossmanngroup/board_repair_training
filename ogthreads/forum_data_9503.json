            "message": "Hello, I have a Mac Air 13inch that will not boot up. It Chimes and hangs about 1/3 of the booting process at Apple logo. I am able to run a hardware test and the result attached. Have tried a working SSD as well as an external one but same issue and same result in AHT. Same for the BT module. Any suggestions?\n\nEDIT: no liquid spil after careful inspection in microscope. The mac just stopped. Just now i changed the BT/WIFI Module and drive for another 100% working one and ran another test, no issues found now. But still hanging at boot at 1/3 to 50% of the bar. Safe boot gives the same issue."
