Any ideas in where i should start testing?"

I rechecked the smc lid and it is 3.3v at the j5700 j4700 r5071,  i believe i might have checked the smc lid with the lid closed the first time not thinking.  \nStill no power button.  don't see any corrosion anywhere"

If i had to guess there was an issue with the trace to the connector and it wasn't receiving the voltage to be shorted to ground on the connector. Hope this helps."

I'm going to recheck everything there and see what seems to be going on. could be connector on the board like you just said since i did try testing with different key and track but possible i did something wrong when checking so will double check and figure this out from here.  \nMany thanks for all the help Duke!"
