            "message": "Hi,\n\nThat's my first post on this forum, and having big hopes about it ;-)\nKidding...\n\nSo I have that 820-3437 board which starts but only get the fan spinning once. Then full blast and I feel that the CPU is getting too fast.\nI've the CPU rail PPVVC_S0_CPU which is a stable 1.78V (I was hoping for a higher voltage by a bad regulator or transistors)\n\nI would replace the Bios chip or the clock chip but I will check that first.\n\nHowever, I have a basic question since I have a few other 820-3437 with burning CPUs... should we assume CPU is dead if it's boiling or is there still hope?"
