            "message": "Hi Team, 2Informaticos\n\nFinally I've found what was the \"issue\".\nMaybe It is obvious for some of you guys but it was tricky to find; so I wanted to share.\nIn fact I've tried 2 different GOOD SSDs, not seen at the boot : folder with the ? mark, but if I boot on a installer from a regular usb stick, I could see the SSDs with disk utility then able to format in HFS and restore a SIERRA image on them with no problem, but still can't boot on them....HUMMM.....that made me crasy until I've tried a 3rd different SSD.\nThat last one was a Samsung and worked at the first time VS the 2 different others ( both Sandisk ).\nHere is attached a picture of the 3 different SSDs ( 2 Sandisk and 1 Samsung ).\n\nI Hope this will help some of you guys\n\nYou can mark this topic as SOLVED and close it\n\nThank you for your support\n\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\tSSDs.jpg Views:\t0 Size:\t304.2 KB ID:\t49118\" type=\"full\" width=\"30%\"]49118._xfImport[/ATTACH]"
