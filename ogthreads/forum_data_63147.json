On the occasion it had a short on 3v3 line that was preventing machine to turn on, also some corrosion around U7100, which I cleaned and replaced. Machine worked well for the next 2 or 3 months and yesterday it came back. Machine turns on, get all voltages, no POST. Board alone draws around 1 amp from charger, CPU gets hot and have 0.9V on L7211/21 but no chime. Tried flashing BIOS and verified all termination resistors, all good... Still no POST. Tried replacing U7100 again, same."

But after that, I put it back on the case and it never posted anymore, so back to point zero. I even thought it was bad BIOS file because when the board posted it was right after flashing a different file on BIOS chip, but couldn't make it anymore. Probably something has a bad contact and the heat used to solder the chip made it work... Maybe bad PCH solder?"

Board almost all times gives 0.64V on L7211/21 if external monitor connected and internal disconnected, but no chime/video. If internal screen is connected and external disconnected  L7211/21 give 0.9V and same no chime/video. Looks like BIOS somehow is communicating with CPU/PCH but something is still missing."
