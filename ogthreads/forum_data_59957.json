            "message": "Hello, \nthe first problem of this board was no green light (missing PP3V42_G3H) \nI solved this issue by fixing burned R7080 (corrosion).\nSo now I have all power rails ON on the board and 590mA on power supply but still no fan.\nI have PP5V_S0 ON but the issue is that I have 0 V to the PWM from SMC to control fan speed.\nSo I booted the board in SMC bypass mode and now I have a fan speed with max speed which is normal.\nWhat can be the issue? why the board seems to boot normaly without fan spin ?\n\nthx,\nVincent"
