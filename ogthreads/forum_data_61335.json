SMC bypass still won't start the board either. \n\nJ6100 originally had stuff on it, that was one of the first things I addressed thinking that was going to solve it all haaha. Things look good now also around U6100. There was also corrosion at U6101 and C6101 prior to my post here and both of those were replaced and traces around those have been checked."
