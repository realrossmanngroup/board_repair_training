            "message": "Hi Guys. Really odd one. MBP A1278 820-3115-B. Come in for running extremely slow. Normal things, slow boot, cursor judders, slow to load web pages and load apps. Opened it up, no sign of liquid ingress anywhere. board is dusty so blew off with compressed air ( from a compressor not a can). Found that had C6603 blown and U6610 was cracked. Removed both components and saw extensive damage to the logic board, please see attached images. From a donor, I have replaced both and jumped the relevant points U6610 pin 8 to a test point slightly down to the left and and pin 9 to R6612 pin 1. C6603 pin 2 has been jumped to pin 2 on C6607. Now I know all these components are for audio so don't suspect this to be the cause of the issue.\nI reassembled the MBP and run the ASD that is already on the machine. In basic and full test there are no faults found, thus discounting a sensor issue ( not fully discounted as yet). I have replaced the RAM, HDD with a clean install, booted from a USB install, changed the HDD ribbon, left the K/B and trackpad not connected and used USB K/B and mouse, left optical/ WiFi board, spk's and camera disconnected, re-pasted the CPU ( it was getting warm but not enough to concern me), reset PRAM and SMC just for good measure and it still runs like dog sh*t.\n\nAny words of wisdom oh guru's of the forums.... :)"
