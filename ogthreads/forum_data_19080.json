            "message": "Hi Team,\nToday morning received a Macbook Pro with 820-3115 logic board.\nThe customer complained that last night he was watching a movie and then it just shut down, so he thought it was the battery and kept it to charge the whole night, but the computer will not come on this morning.\nWhen the computer came to me I did the following :\n1. Tried disconnecting the battery and connect the computer directly with the magsafe adapter - The computer came on - but after the Apple Logo the computer shuts down after reaching almost 10% of progress bar.\n2. Another thing I observed is that though the battery indicator ( push button on the side ) showing that the battery is full but the computer does not come on by pressing the power button on battery power. Only when the magsafe adapter is plugged in then only the computer gives the chime.\n3. I thought probably the hard drive is failing hence the OS is not loading, so I tried to boot the system from an external drive, but with that as well the progress bar reaches to almost 10% and then the system just shuts down. The fan stops spinning.\n4. The computer only comes on when the magsafe is connected and after it comes on"

I figured out that when the trackpad is plugged in the original problem of the computer starting up and then shutting down occurs.  Now I encounter a different problem.  The computer only comes on when the magsafe adapter is plugged in.  It does not come on when the power button is depressed, though the battery is full.   Is this a one wire circuit problem, or is it the battery and the battery indicator creating this problem.  I shall try to troubeshoot with a new battery, but your feedback shall help me diagnose the problem faster.  Thanks.  Raj."

I also think ( correct me if i am wrong ) that the keyboard is connected via the trackpad.  So if the trackpad is disconnected the keyboard also does not work.  While the machine is one and if i connect the trackpad, the keyboard becomes active but as trackpad seems to have a problem, it just shuts the machine down. \nI have a machine from which i can pull a good know trackpad and see if that solves the problem.  \nWill keep you guys posted.\nThanks again.\nRaj."

Now in this case as Jessa pointed out \"You don't have a board problem until you KNOW you DON'T have a parts problem.\"  In my case it was the keyboard and I was thinking that it was the board.
