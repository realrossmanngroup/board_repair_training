            "message": "Hi there,\n\ncurrently I'm struggeling with a MBP 2015 15\" (820-00138). It had some corrosion in the are arround the LVDS connector (on both sides of the MLB).\nNow the USB port is not working and there is no internal display. Works fine with external display so far.\nPP5VR3V3_SW_LCD goes high for some seconds when booting but drops to 0V then. \nLCD_CONN_HP does not go high. Display assembly works fine with other MLB. \nAlready replaced the LVDS connector but it didn't changed anything.\n\nWould be happy if someone has an idea where the issue is?\n\nBest regards\nDudi"
