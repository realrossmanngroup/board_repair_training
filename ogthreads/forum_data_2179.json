            "message": "Hi, currently I have a problem with my personal MBPr. Today I was working with my laptop. Than I felt like a drop of sweat was falling near the trackpad. I looked at it but couldn't find any wet spots. But right after that, my trackpad was going wild. It's clicking, moving the mouse horizontally back and forth. I tried to reset the PRAM and NVRAM and remove and reset the trackpad connector from the board, but without success. \n\nYes, I know, the new trackpad costs about 30$, but I have to wait for it 2-3 Weeks. In the meantime I deactivated the Trackpad, when a mouse is connected. Does anyone have some experience with repairing the trackpad?"
