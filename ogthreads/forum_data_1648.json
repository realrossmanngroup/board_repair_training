The voltage from the U7000 to the gate of the mosfets that are creating the 12.8v rail are fluctuating, the top one fluctuates around 10.51v and the bottom one 1.82v. The output is 8.42v to PPBUS_G3H, which should be 12.8v. I replaced the U7000 and the SMC but it didn't help. I also noticed that the pull up resistors between the U7000 and the SMC are fluctuating as well. The voltage drops from 3.5v to 3.4v and inbetween. Is this normal?\n\nI've already checked the current sensing circuit but both are good. \n\nDoes anyone recognizes this problem or has any idea what could cause this?"
