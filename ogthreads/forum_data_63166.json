Checked diode on all big coils and checked with IR for any heat on board. Tested on bench with only power cord plugged in. Doesn't start in SMC bypass. \n\nPM_EN_5vS4 is not present. S5 Pwrgd is present. SMC_reset_L is 3V.\n\nI'm unable to find what would trigger PM_EN_5VS4 or if something is missing between that and S5_PWRGD. I also checked diode mode of both battery SCL/SDA and they match at .429"

I put everything back pulling parts from different board and thought everything was good. Plugged in and board started to try to start and pulling amperage but U2800 fried a hole near the center and dead short on PP3V3_TBT_X_S0. Don't know if it having heat to it finished it off or something else wrong. Not seeing anything out of sorts near the ports. short is gone after pulling U2800"
