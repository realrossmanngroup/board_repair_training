            "message": "820-00165 is giving me so much hard time ......guys , what typically do you do on a board with missing PM_SLP_S4_L ? At what point do you give up ? I mean on a board that is not liquid damaged and has no short to ground... please help , I need to be sure I have gone over it all before sending it off my desk , I would be risking my job if after I fail someone else get it done just because i was too dumb to figure it out . Please help me guys.  What am trying to say is , what rail sequence do you go over , before you can pack up on a board that is missing PM_SLP_S4_L .... please guys I really wanna know ... Thank you so much in advance."

Also have to have PP3v42, PPBUS, PPVRTC_G3H, PP5v_S5, PP3v3_S5, PM_BATLOW_L all present before saying missing PM_SLP_S4_L is the problem. I always check those specific rails before calling it quits."

            "message": "Well, they're not easy, so it would be hard to judge someone too harshly for not getting it fixed. It took me forever to get reasonably good at it. I give up after I've cleaned up and replaced everything that had damage from a spill, tested for all necessary voltages (see above, and also make sure SMC_PM_G2_EN is present), tested continuity with all the SPI lines (complete pain but necessary). But if I get a board with no spill I'm not feeling great. Those corrosion areas are almost always the easy path. With a no-spill board make sure it wasn't cleaned before. Look for any ugly areas that might have been cleaned already. I'm sure there's more but that's what I'm coming up with at the moment."
