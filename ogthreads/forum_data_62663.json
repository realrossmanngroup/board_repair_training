            "message": "I've a nice case and LCD of a A1707 which contains a completely damaged 820-00928 board (some broken ways and copper pads becomes loose when trying to solder).\nI like to check if his LCD is still fully functional.\n\nWhen I connect the 820-00923 board of my A1706 (see previous topic) on the LCD of the A1707, will this give me a picture?\nT-Con connector to motherboard seems to be the same. Just the desired backlight voltage of the A1707 seems to be a little amount higher. I think I can't destroy anything?\nSomeone already tried this?\n\nthanks!"

Although it's not happened already, this is still a \"flexgate\" screen.\nI will search for a good, or repairable board for the Macbook\nBut is there a known good workaround to prevent flexgate with this screen?"
