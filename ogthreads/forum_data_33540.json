            "message": "I have an 820-3662 that was liquid damaged. I had to replace the keyboard IC because the V,B,N,M, , , keys were not working despite changing the keyboard. After changing the IC it was working but the keyboard backlight didn't work even though the system would let me turn it up or down. After taking voltage measurements it suddenly started working intermittently, sometimes it will flash on and off every few seconds but at the same time this occured the keyboard and trackpad stopped working when on. SMC reset works, the power button works to turn it on, and if i hold the power button down it turns off the mac. Could it be the trackpad cable? I didn't move it while testing the backlight voltages so it would be weird if that was the cause.\n\nAlso, this device had it's backlight circuit obliterated by the liquid damage, I replaced nearly everything on there and the backlight circuit is working fine now for display. Thunderbolt circuit was also destroyed, I removed most components on there and haven't decided to replace them yet."

It stopped working when I was doing tests on the keyboard backlight :/ Or maybe I shorted something on the tpad connector and messed up the pch.\n\nI'm going to try a new trackpad and if that doesn't work then I'll likely sell this MacBook as is on eBay or something."
