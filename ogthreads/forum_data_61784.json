            "message": "Hi all,\n\ni bought another donor board off eBay to have a look at last week. 3437 which has no PP3V42 or PPbus shorts. In fact PP3V42 is present but I\u2019m not getting a green light on the charger. There is sever corrosion on C3740, R3741 and R3742. U3740 looks ok though but I\u2019ll probably replace it to be safe. Issue is both pads for C3740 and r3742 and one pad for r3741 are completely gone and R3742 is now reading ground on both ends.\n\nI saw a slight amount of corrosion on pin 8 of U7100 but upon removal it seems fine so I\u2019m hoping that was just surface junk.\n\nQuestion is can the board boot without the above 3 mentioned pads intact? I\u2019m not fussed about internal ssd I can always use a USB dock but I\u2019m not sure if those are going to be required for boot or not. Unfortunately I do not have any donor boards to substitute these parts so it\u2019s back to the Ali express waiting game.\n\nthanks!"

According to Logiwiki their example had pin 3 as 3.81 and the threshold minimum is 3.2 so I'm thinking 4.32 is too high but than checking all the components on PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL which controls that line are matching their values so I'm puzzled as to why it's so high. I also tried removing F7140 and checking which side if any are short, but the CPU side is in the millions of ohms and the other side is in the K of ohms range. Diode modes were .7 and .18 respectively. Injecting voltage revealed nothing really, the caps on that line got slightly warm but only very mildly and they read non short so seem fine."

Looking around the ISL immediate area will report back once completed, just thought I should do these first as Q3170 was originally the issue so likely is the issue again. Removed C7105 again as it was causing my meter to read OL on pin 2 of R7105. Can it be left off just for testing purposes? I do not have any other 50V caps to use."
