            "message": "It was a liquid damage board, the spill was around q7130 area.\ni have cleaned and replaced all components, there is a short on system side of l7130, i haven't looked into yet as i was trying to get ppbus before hunting that short, so long story short i have replaced all components including isl6259 but i still get 15.80 volts instead of 12.56 on pin 1 of l7130.\nresistance between pin 17/18 and 27/28 is 3 and 20 ohms.\ni have compared values to working board and pin 21 of isl have around .8 volts on working board and non working have 0 on it.\nwhat else should i check?"

            "message": "If you have 15 volts, I don't think you can possibly have a short...if you're worried on that removed F7140 and see if there is a low resistance reading on either side of the fuse. 16 volts means, Q7130 is shorted and always open. If this is the problem, replace Q7130, the ISL6259, and Q7155 all at the same time."
