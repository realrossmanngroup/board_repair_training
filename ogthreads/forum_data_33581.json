The green led on charger lights up for about a minute then goes off. The computer wont switch on from power or from battery.\n\nso far ive measured the following.\n\nPPDCIN_G3H - 16.2V\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.6V\n\ncould anyone please point me in the right direction.\n\nP.S Yes im using 85w charger and yes its the original charger."
