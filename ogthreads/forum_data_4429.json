            "message": "[h=2][URL=\"https://gsxapp.apple.com/WebApp/products.htm#\"]MacBook Air (13-inch,Mid 2013)[/URL][/h] \nThis MacBook was originally water damaged. I cleaned it and replaced the left I/O board. With the bad left I/O board, the backlight would flash at startup and then turn off and stay off. Replacing the left I/O board solved the backlight issue. \n\nNow the keyboard backlight stays on unless you manually shut it off while in daylight or well lit area. I understand the light proximity sensor is in the iSight camera in the display. \nI tried a different display and the same issue persists. I don't see any damage or corrosion on the camera connector on the main logic board. \n\nCan someone point me in the right direction here? Where do I find the circuit related to the proximity sensor in the schematic? \n\nThanks!"
