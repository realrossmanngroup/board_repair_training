This is my personal macbook.\nits a 820-3332-a board that stopped booting all of a sudden.\ni had problems with the display that would sometimes refuse to turn on after sleep.\n\ni opened it to find the top of the gpu smashed and pieces of it all around the case. \n\nThe machine was not dropped, moved even touched between the time it was working vs not.\n\nis it possible that it is a coincidence and that it was working even with this chip in pieces ?\n\ndid it explode ?\n\ni?m so confused"
