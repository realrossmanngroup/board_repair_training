            "message": "This 820-3330 can work perfektly fine. Unfortunately only randomly it starts and works. The rest of the time its dead with just an green light (orange light is just there it it decides to start) and fan twitch ~ every 1 second. I can hear a clicking noise (i guess from a transistor?!) if the fans twitch.\nI checked a few things and as sometimes even the green light was fading away i replaced ISL and SMC already. Now the green light is there every time (orange light still only if it starts) but still starts only randomly...\nI checked all rails for shorts and PP1V05_TBT has just 17 Ohms to GND (not sure if thats ok?). If it starts there is 1,1V on that line...\nSo i am confused at this point."

PPBUS is jumping between 10.X V and 12,6 V) This board should start from a 85W charger without battery if i am right. I tested with customer battery (just in case) but still the same. Just in case i tested a different battery and it seems to work from that battery most of the times but still not from the charger. Also sometimes it turms itshelf right back off after a few seconds (sometimes it chimes - sometimes is turns off earlier. This happens from battery and battery + charger). I traced this back and came to D6990 that was leaking charger voltage to the battery (0.2 V in diode mode but it should read OL between pin 1&2) So i replaced D6990 (now its reading is OL) And it seems to start and work with the new battery.\nStill sometimes pulsing and fan twitch without batterty sometimes working fine..."
