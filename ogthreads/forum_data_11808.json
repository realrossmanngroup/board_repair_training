A man of few words.\n\nIt has been in an AASP where they just offered him to replace the MLB. I can not see any corrosion anywhere but when I looked on the board under the microscope I could see small brush marks as if someone tried to clean something off between the ram chips. I gave it a UC but still the same. I suspect it had a minor liquid damage at some point and I will see if I can get the customer to admit it.\n\nthe SSD controller gets a little hot (~50 C) when connected but is not recognized. When I take the SSD out and into another machine it is working fine and do not get as hot."

How could I still have correct voltage on this rail (3.3V) ???\n\nBut it lead me to inject voltage on the rail and U3900 (camera BGA) got hot. I pulled it and the fucking machine is now booting. Now I obviously dont have camera support but who gives the shit. \n\nI still dont understand why I had correct voltage readings on J3700. Shouldn't PP3V3_S0 have got pulled down ? Can you explain this ?\n\nI did not measure voltage on PP3V3_S3RS0_CAMERA before i pulled U3900 but I assume it must had been low ? \n\nWhat the fuck ????"
