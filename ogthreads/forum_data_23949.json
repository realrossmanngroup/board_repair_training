If the board is power cycling there will be very short pulses which are hard to catch on a multimeter. If you have an auto range meter it will never see them. Preferably use a scope to catch the pulses.\n\nFew more things you can check is SMC_ ADAPTER_EN, DSW_PWRGD. Check all rails for short to GND. Inspect the usual suspects for corrosion: U1900, U1950, U6100 and the termination resistors in the data lines to U6100."
