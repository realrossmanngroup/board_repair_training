            "message": "Have a 820-2850 fixed for a customer or so i thought by replacing the 9560.  sometimes it will boot fully into osx and runs videos etc without any trouble last time i tested it for 5 hours of video playing sent it back and it was crashing on him every 10 min or less.  I will get it to load into osx once and then i restart it to test again and it will crash during loading and keeps doing this until i turn it off for a bit and then re try it. everytime i test it i can get it to load into osx atleast once but crashes more than it will load in.  I double checked my work on the 9560 and all is good.  I checked voltage on 9560 and im getting 1.35v\nAny ideas? weird to me it works fully sometimes.  and when i try to run asd it crashes every time before it can load."
