I can even run stress tests or geekbench with no issue. Also all the sensor values read normal\nAfter starting with an external display the mac seems to fully load every time and work as normal, just with the built-in display, even shut down and reboot normally.\nThe issue only returns if unplugging the battery and charger for a while, in which case I have to use an external screen again or the laptop freezes\n\nTruly bizarre issue that I can't find an explanation for"
