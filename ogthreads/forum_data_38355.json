I cant find any other missing components on the board."

Was then taken into another shop for No Wifi and Battery not running off battery but would boot fully to OS. When given back they said it was completely dead and they didn't know why was then taken to me. I've looked all over the board and found no knocked off components except C3760 and the missing battery screw most likely the causes of the original issues. Does any one have a known good 820-00281 bios on the off chance that is the issue?"
