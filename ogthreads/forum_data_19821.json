            "message": "I have an 820-00165 board that has been liquid damaged and does not boot. MagSafe does responds (green, then amber). Looking at the board under the scope showed significant damage to pins 3 and 4 on LVDS. Found corrosion on U3210 and burn marks on C2385 and C3211. No continuity from U3210 pin 18 to C3285.\n\nStarted going through power rails and found everything was there until I got 0V on PP3V3_S4. So I replaced U3210, C3285, C3286, and C3211 from a donor board. Jumpered U3210 pin 18 to C2385. Still 0V on PP3V3_S4.\n\nSuggestions on how to proceed?"
