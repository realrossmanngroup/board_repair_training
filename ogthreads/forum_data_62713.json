I get error message:\n\nThe System cannot be restored on this device.\n\nThe operation couldn't be completed .\"AMRestoreErrorDomain error 6 - failed to handle message type StatusMsg (Operation failed))\n[AMRestoreErrorDomain - 0x6 (6)]\n\nI used another 2019 MacBook Pro 15\" with Catalina and Monterey. It failed both times.\n\n\nThere is no chime, no charging sound, nothing. I connect the charger and get 20v 0.05 to 0.93A in DFU mode.\n\nI took the bottom cover off and board looks fine, no corrosion or damage."
