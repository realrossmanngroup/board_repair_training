It had some resistors R5177, R5178, R5179 corroded, I changed them and it did not give video again, check resistors and they are well placed, I do not know when placing resistors affect the smc that are nearby. Any suggestions\n\n\nPP3V42_G3H_REG= 3.41                                         \nPPBUS_G3H=8.58\nPP5V_S4RS3=5.1V\nPP3V3_S5_REG=3.3V\nPP1V05_S0=1.05\nPP1V2_S3=1.2\nPPVCC_S0_CPU_PH1=1.81\nPPVCC_S0_CPU_PH2=1.81\nSMC_RESET_L=3.3V\nPLT_RESET_L=3.3V"
