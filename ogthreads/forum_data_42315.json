            "message": "Hello!\n\nI have always interested in component level repair, so when the opportunity to get a liquid damaged Mac Book Air arrived, I was delighted. So bear with me, as this is my first attempt at this.\n\nI have a Green/Orange on the Mag Safe, but no fan spin.\n\nBelow are my voltages.\n\nPPBUS G3H = 8.58\n\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISN = 8.58\n\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS = 8.58\n\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL = 15.13\n\nPPDCIN_G3 = 15.13\n\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.44\n\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3.33\n\nPP5V_S5 = 5.2\n\nPP5V_S4RS = 3.34 Pulse\n\nPP5V_S0 = 3.14 pulse\n\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.33\n\nPP3V3_S4 = 0.33\n\nPP3V3_SUS = 3\n\nPP3V3_S3 = Pulse 2\n\nPP3v3_S0 = Pulse 1\n\nPP3V3_S4SW_SNS = Pulse 3\n\nPP3V3_S0SW_SSD = 2.3\n\nPP3V3_S4_TBTAPWR = Pulse 3\n\nPP1V8_S3 = 1.7\n\nPP1V2_S3 = Pulse .70\n\nPP1V05_SUS = 1.06\n\nPP1V5_S0 = 1.5\n\nPP0V6_S0_DDRVTT = Pulse .34\n\nPP1V05_S0SW_PCH_HSIO = 1.05\n\nPP5V_S4RS3 = Pulse 3.34\n\nThe little corrosion I found was near U6100. I cleaned with with isopropyl alcohol. I measured all 16 terminator resistors and they are fine. The only issue I can find (besides the voltages) is Pin 2 on U6100 (SPI_MLB_MISO), does not have continuity with R6114, R6123 or it\u2019s VIA (824). My questions are\u2026 [LIST=1]\n[*]Should I be getting continuity from those locations? If so, is re-soldering the chip/replacing is my next step? I know it\u2019s a BIOS chip, so it\u2019s not a simple rip and replace.\n[*]Is 15.13 too far out of tolerance for PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL/PPDCIN_G3 which should be 18.5?\n[*]If I understood Louis's Rossmann Repair Training Guide correctly, should all of the rails be pulsing?\n[*]Any other suggestions as to what I should look into?\n[/LIST]\n\nPS: PS:32 > IS:24 > Wagner 08 :)"

I had a feeling this was an issue, but did not want to chase down something if it was not an issue.\n\nWould removing U6100 an putting it back on/replacing it be the best way to resolve this issue?
