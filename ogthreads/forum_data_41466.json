If it does detect the charger, does it charge the battery from it without the light working?\n\nJust running through the basics before we're digging into circuits"

Or does it simply just not charge with the 45W?\n\nVoltage of PPDCIN_G3H with the 45W charger connected?\n\nIf its charging with 60W+ chargers I doubt U7100 itself is the culpit, I would suspect the SMC the most but even that woudn't explain why it does charge over 60W and 85W chargers. The only difference between those chargers is the voltage slightly...\n\nDoes the board look OK physically? Any history?"
