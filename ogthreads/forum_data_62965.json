            "message": "Good day, guys.\n\nI have a 15 inches 2016/17 Touch Bar with no display on internal. When I measured in DIODE MODE {{EDP_AUXCH_C_P}} signal was very low compared to a working board which led me to replace U9850 from a donor board, then checked again in Diode mode, and this time the value I got was that of a working board, but I still do not have an internal screen display. Is there something else I need to do in a situation like this aside from replacing U9850? especially given that the signal was low at first, which points to an issue in the region. Please help."
