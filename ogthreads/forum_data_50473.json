            "message": "hi friends.\n\nI just have an 820-3787 here it had a hole in the board near u7100 and no power on\n\nI replaced U7100 and soldered the missing traces. After that it worked, Trackpad working, keyboard wrote what it want. Then with a new Akku I noticed that It consumed 4-6A, after that I limited the curent to 3,5\n\nI found that R7121/22 are bad. After replacing current was normal (about 3.4A not rising anymore)\n\nNow I found that the damaged U7100 burned a hole in the Keyboard cable until the metal of the keyboard.\n\nSo I replaced the keyboard. But still the same problem.\n\nI tryed another mainboard in the same case, now keyboard and trackpad is working well.\n\n\nI dont know why but the keyboard and trackpad is not working anymore.\n\nI found on J4800  Pin 22 and 18 has power,\nPin 20 Z2_CLKIN nothing\n\nSo I checked U 4801 and found in diode mode Pin 23-28 nothing.\n\nI replaced U4801, Diode mode all pins ok now.J4800 Pin 20 has clock now. But no trackpad ( I disconnected the keyboard and only try to get trackpad until now)\n\nthen I found in the forum that duke wrote U4801 needs only power and usb and as to show up in the osx. I tryed with a good mainboard first. internal keyboard and trackpad is shown up.\n\nwith the problem board it shows nothing. In diode mode I get on R4801/02 both sides the same reading (good and bad board)\n\nR4801 has 3.13V, R4802 0V. On the good board it has 0V as well\n\nThe U4801 is programmed. I took it from a 820-3332. Pinout is the same. may be there is no comunication?\n\nExternal keyboard and mouse is working good\n\nNeed some help please"

            "message": "R4801 has 24.6 Ohm\nR4802 has 24.2 Ohm\n\nmeans good I think.BUTTON_DISABLE signal has 0V\nU4801 PIN 22/49 have 3.3V\n\nI just have no donor here to test that, I have a good working board only. I will check that.\nThe Pinout is the same, I tryed the board with an mid 2012 retina trackpad but no way.\nIf there is a different then has the U1100 a problem in comunication with USB, but USB should be the same protocol.\n\nFor me is intresting that I have on R4802 0V also on the good board. I expected there signals like on R4801. Or is that because its differntial and no comunication, means one line has 3.13V, high pegel and the other has low pegel?"
