            "message": "Hello,\nI have a Macbook 820-00165. Customer said it isnt turning on. When it came to me it turned on just once for sometime and the dead.\nUpon inspection i found corrosion at R8159 R8158 R8151 R8152.\nReplaced them. Still no success.\n\nI checked all the Power Rails.\nI am getting PM_SLP_S3_BUF_L 3.3V at R8167 but ALL_SYS_PWRGD is at 0.6V. Thought it looked fine i replaced R8167 too.\n\nChecked from crap below Q8150 as the corrosion was below it. But nothing there too.\nMacbook is drawing around 180Amps."
