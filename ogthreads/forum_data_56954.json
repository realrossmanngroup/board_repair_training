            "message": "Hello, \n\nThis motherboard came with a little corrosion close to u7501, properly c7537, r7521, c7536. \n\nBut i think that corrosion it's not the main problem. \n\nI found F7140 opened, and  i noticed PPBUS it's shorted! when i apply 1V on PPB?S the PCH get's real hot more than usualy. I noticed to, when i apply 1-2 volts on PPBUS the PP1V05_s0_PCH have 1.05V.\n\nRip processor? \n\nthanks"
