            "message": "I have this board that was liquid damaged. The customer said they already replaced the keyboard and battery but the backlight doesn't work and an image can be seen with a flashlight. I have removed the logic board and I don't see any areas with visible corrosion but it does look like they may have cleaned it with alcohol and brush.\nI don't have another display assembly to check if the display is the issue.\n\nI measured Pins 1 and 30 of the LCD connector and I got 54.6v on LCD Backlight and 5v on Pin 30. With only the screen plugged in I got 3.32v on BKL_EN and 0v on Pin 1 of R7747(SMC_SYS_KBDLED / BKLT_PWM_KEYB).\n\nI'm not familiar with the backlight circuit on these Macbook Pro's so I'm not sure where to measure."
