            "message": "820-00165 supposedly replaced with a new board a couple of weeks ago. Clear signs board has seen liquid damage and was ultrasonic'd and put back in to service as it probably booted \"then\".\n\nNow the unit will only green/orange light & fan spin. The fan spin runs for about 10 seconds, then stops, then starts again, and about 7~8 minutes later stops completely. LED on USB will flash once on initial power, and then when the fan spins up again after the 10 second lull point but never again.\n\nPPBUS_G3H 8.6V, 3V42 present too. All other rails present that I've bee able to test, including CPU at 1.8V\n\nBubbling corrosion on the tracks for U1930 / R1931, as well as corrosion under R8152.\n\nProblem might be that CPU_VCCST_PWRGD is being pulled down slightly to 0.98V from 1.05V, I've removed U1930 and R1800 and the slight pull down still occurs, leaving either the PCB or the CPU causing the slight pull down.\n\nBIOS, SMC, RTC Gen, PCH HSIO Switch ( U8005 ) all checked/replaced and appear to be okay.\n\nFeel like I'm missing something blatently obvious."
