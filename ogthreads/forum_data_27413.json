            "message": "This board had water damage. It started working fine after letting it enjoy my UC, but the magsafe light stayed off. Took me some time before I figured out that one of the pins in the LIO connector had corroded itself in half. Its the PP3V42_G3H pin, so that explains the missing light.\nI've considered running a jumper over to the magsafe board, but that would suck if someone had to take the board out again, plus some other pins aren't looking pristine either.\nI have some donor boards underway, but provided they have good connectors on there, the question is if those can be removed without destroying them. I was thinking wrapping them in tin foil tape to keep the heat away from the plastic, but not sure if that would do it. Anyone have experience with this or know if these can be bought seperately? I found some in the US on ebay: [url]http://www.ebay.nl/itm/Lot-of-NEW-USB-I-O-Power-Board-Connector-for-MacBook-Air-11-A1465-2015/232193722395?hash=item360fd3081b:m:mM1U5_TpVhg3yBoFGYFHyiQ[/url], but shipping costs are ridiculous."
