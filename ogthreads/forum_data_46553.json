            "message": "G'day folks,\n\nGot a 2015 13\" Retina here that doesn't recognize SSD's. Visually there is nothing wrong with the board that would point to a cause for this issue. Tested several SSD's all have the same issue. Techtool pro DOES show the SSD under SMART check but can't run the test. AHT shows the battery needs service but doesn't mention an SSD issue. Option-boot shows a recovery partition but won't boot from it (SSD does get warm so is getting power). macOS, Disk Utility and System Information show the controller but no info on the SSD.\n\nI don't know where to even begin looking for a board issue on this one, any pointers much appreciated :)"
