I assume that getting All_Sys_pwrgd is telling U7100 to shout out the 2 S0 voltages?!\nResistance to ground on Vcore is 5ohms which is matching a known working board.\nI understand that there is a high probability that the CPU is out but since the resistance to ground is fair and the original problem was the CD3215 I am not giving up on this one just yet."
