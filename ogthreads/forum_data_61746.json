It works, gives image on external monitor, and with a flashlight on the back, it shows image.\nI don't understand this readings:\n\nOn F9700 I get 0V on the pad 1 and it seams that PPBUS_3GH is shorted\nPPBUS_3GH = 0V 0 ohm and 0V on diode mode.\n\nBut everything seams to be working besides the backlight.\n\nAlready removed F9700 with same readings.\n\nCan you help?"
