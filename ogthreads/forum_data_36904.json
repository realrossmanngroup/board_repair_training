            "message": "I had a rain damaged 820-3437b in the last few days.  no obvious problems/corrosion on the board, there were some s0 rails present but no vcore and no fan spin.\n\non testing I found that no pp5v_s4r3 was present on the dcin connector, so replaced that.  Then U8080 got very very hot.  Replacing that returned the board to being able to boot and operate.\n\nBut it only lasted an hour before failing again. (green->orange light present, 5v_s0 present but no vcore)\n\nOn testing the board, the DCin board started smoking (the wee chip just next to the audio connector) when I measured from the PP5V_S4R3 pin and ground.  Current jumped too, and was limited by the PSU.\n\nThis happened on two DCin boards.\n\nany thoughts on the cause of this?  I've not yet tested the rest of the board.\n\nthanks\nJustin"

Test voltage on PP5v_S4R3 on the IO connector and the chip on IO board goes up in smoke.  \n\nI can't work out what is going on electrically to create this issue.  evidently the IO board switches is being asked to draw too much current.

It seems that there is something awry on the PP5v_S4RS3 line.  are there any known culprits that should be investigated?  there does not seem value in pushing voltage down this line since the audio chips are already burning, although I could remove the zero ohm resistor and DCin board and then inject voltage if people think that would be useful?"
