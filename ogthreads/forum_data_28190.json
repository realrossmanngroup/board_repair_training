            "message": "Hi,\n\nso i got this liquid damaged macbook pro retina 15'' 2015 in today.\n\nSeems like the liquid got in from the side and dried up in the corner (see pics). The logic board and ssd etc are completely clean, no corrosion no damage no liquid stains.\n\nThe last cell of the battery which has the white stuff on it , is swollen and the battery does not work.\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\n\nthe issue is that when i connect the power adapter in, the macbook does not boot. loading bar goes quarter way then restarts and continues in that cycle.\n\nTried new ssd. same issue when booting into recovery or safe mode.\n\nany ideas?"
