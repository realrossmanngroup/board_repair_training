Now turns on and boots into OS no problem but once turned off with battery connected it will not turn back on unless battery is unplugged. Charges and recognizes battery fine.\n\nOn just the charger if you force power off with keyboard power button the board automatically turns back on within a few seconds. U5110 replaced with no change. R5100 measures good. Tested using known good keyboard.\n\nWhat to check next?"
