Everytime the power button was triggered, smc will perform a reset and macbook will not start .\nI Fix it and now it works but fans goes high speed.\n\nTested with only trackpad, I/O Board, fan connected.\nAlready tried changing trackpad & flex.\nFan goes high rpm when loading MacOS but stays low rpm with SSD disconnected.\n(So the issue is when it switch in SPI, right?)\n\nU4810 goes to correct value when OS is loading....\nPin 1,3,5,6,8 =3,3v\n\nDiode mode measuring on J4800 are OK compared to another working board.\n\nNo Issues found in AHT.\nAll temperatures ok on HWMonitor.\nMacbook speed seems regular.\nIn system preferences- Trackpad , no device can be seen, so no personalization is avaiable. But trackpad works with no issue.\nIn system report - SPI - I can see the trackpad listed.\n\nR4850-4851-4852-4853 are ok.\n\nCan be ME region corrupted? No one touched U6100 before..."
