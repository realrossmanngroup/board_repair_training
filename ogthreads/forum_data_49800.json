            "message": "I have a 820-00840 here that is just over a year old. The customer has taken it to Apple and they said the motherboard is dead. I have inspected both sides of the motherboard. I cant see any water damage, although there was a tiny amount of corrosion on both ends of C8400, no short is detected on that cap. When the charger is plugged in no fans spin, at the battery terminals the voltage is 0 volts when the charger is plugged in.\n\nI have taken some readings near u7000 and this is what they were :\nPPDCIN_G3H_CHGR @ 7020 = 20.32V\nPPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H @ U7000 = 20.07V\nPPVBAT_G3H_CHGR_REG @ U7000 = 0V\nPD_SMC_CBC_ON @ U7000 = 0V\nSMC_CHGR_INT_L @ U7000 = 3.4\nDCINVSENS_EN_L @ U7000 = 19.79V\nSMC_RESET_R_L @ U7000 = 3.4\nPPVCCCPU_S0G = 0.00v"
