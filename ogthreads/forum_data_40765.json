            "message": "Could you please help me understanding one thing,\nAs I understood from your previews explanations 5 volt rail and 3v rail are created by the same component. and an other component ( the SMC i think ) decides which state should become enable ( S5,S4,S3 and S0). Am I correct?\nAn other thing is that first AL S5 rails must be working than the board can go to the next state I mean without S5 there will be no S4 and S3?\nfor example if the 5v is present but only in S5 and not present in PP5_V5_S3 than it mean's that there is something on S3 rail gone bad and sends the 5v to the ground or blocks the 5v.\n\nI'm really really great full and appreciate your help and effort."
