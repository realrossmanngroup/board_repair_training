I replaced one of the CD32 chips as nothing was coming up on amp meter on that one port. then i got the 5V back on that port. Just in case replaced both of them in case one was causing the no 20V\n\nscanned the board and saw that u8210 was fried, replaced that\nthen i did some more checking and realised f6700 was blown too so replaced that as well. still no difference \n\nI then saw that pp3v3_G3S was only 10ohms from to ground. I injected 3V and saw that u8210 was lit up on thermal. removed that but still had 500ma short on that line. I then saw that there's a small amount of heat coming from under WIFI chip \n\nthis board is a nightmare..."
