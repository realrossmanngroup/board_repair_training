Measured around, replaced Q4690, nothing. C4616 was shorted to ground. Replaced that, still no USB.\n\nNext day I plugged in the charger and got no green light! I thought it would be something easy. I also have a donor board with onewire working. Great help! I measured R6917 pin1 16.82V pin2 0V, healthy board shows pin2 7.42V. R6917 and R6918 measure 140K, schematic says 270K. What the heck?"

            "message": "What is pin 4 of U6915? If it is high I suspect a dead U6915. This happened because of plugging in the magsafe on a bare connector and not aligning it, so onewire shorts to 18V bus.\nYou cannot expect a resistor that is in circuit to measure the correct value. It could be lower because of other stuff in parallel with it. If it measured higher then there could be a problem."
