            "message": "first post ... please be gentle (my hair is already very grey).\n\nI am trying to repair a mac air mid 2013 with an 820-3435 B logic board.   Wine spill on right hand side of keyboard.  \n\nsome noticeable corrosion gunk on the board but all looked rather old; so probably predated the recent spill.  no noticeable liquid residue on the SMC side of the board\n\nthe liquid damage tell-tale under the lcd connector was bright red.  There was some gunk on the connector itself and the pins, but no pad damage, and no evident burning.  \n\nFuse F7770 was burned out, and the cap next to it (C7782) was crisped on one side but still measuring 100nF.  so light cooked rather than cindered. I've removed it for the time being anyway. \n\ngreen light comes on with the charger.  Doesn't turn orange but no battery connected. I've fluxed up the SMC and given it some heat.  only to about 140C though.  \n\nthe power rails are as follows:\n\nPPBUS_G3H                     8.2v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS    8.2v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS        8.2v\n\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL              16.5v\nPPDCIN_G3H                   16.5v\n\nPP3V42_G3H                    3.3v\nPPVRTC_G3H                    0.6v\nPP5V_S5                       0.5v\nPP5V_S4RS3                    0.5v\nPP5V_S0                       1.16v\n\n\ndiode mode measurements to ground\nPPBUS_G3H                     0.131v\nPP3V42_G3H                    0.266v\nPP5V_S5                       0.413v\nPPVRTC_G3H                    0.576v\n\nnothing gets evidently hot.  the SMC is perhaps 8C above ambient.  \n\ncan anyone suggest a diagnosis or steps to take to get closer to one?  I don't have any suitably sized components for swap outs so can't go a trial and error route unfortunately!  \n\nmany thanks in advance. \nJustin"

I would start with measuring resistance to ground on PPVRTC_G3H and check the clock chip area and U5110 area.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nthanks for the replies.  Appreciate that I will need parts.  Mouser supports my area of france adequately, if not rapidly.\n\nresistance to ground from PPVRTC_G3H is 161.5kOhms\n\non U5110 the voltages are:\n\npin 1  3.33v\npin 2  0\npin 3  3.3v     //PP3V42_G3H_SMC_SPV\npin 4  1.8v     //SMC_MANUAL_RESET_L\npin 5  0.65v   //SMC_RESET_L\npin 6  3.26v   //SMC_LSOC_RST_L\npin 7  3.29v   //SMC_ONOFF_L\npin 8  3.29v   //PP3V3_S5_AREF_SMC\n\n\nIs it odd that SMC_RESET_L is being driven low? It is not shorted to ground (16MOhm or so).  The pull up resistor is good although measuring (in circuit) as 70k rather than 100k.  \n\ni've prodded around some of the clock circuit and nothing seems odd apart from the voltage.  But tbh I'm not sure what I should be checking.  could the clock chip be bust?  \n\n\nso ...I reflowed the clock chip, and now get the green charger light turning orange after 3 seconds.  so that's an improvement, I guess? \n\nafter reflowing the clock chip I get 8.6v back on PPBUS, 3.42v on PP3V42_G3H and 1.6v on SMC_RESET_L\n\nbut nothing on PPVRTC_G3H\n\nso perhaps there was a short under the clock chip, now gone with reflowing but the clock chip is bust? \n\nadvice gratefully received.\n\nthanks\nJustin"
