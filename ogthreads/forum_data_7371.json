After a shut down and restart, back to the same white screen no image. This morning i powered it on and got the boot menu and booted to asd 3s132 before i ran the test it failed for mux switching. . question is- Is there anything else that would cause this issue besides a failed gpu? also i fails for cpu 0 vcore, thermal interface, ethernet controller, and cpu diode unable to read sensor."
