            "message": "820-00165-A with no signs of damage. Supposedly suddenly died during an SSD upgrade and subsequent software reinstallation at another shop. When the display is plugged in, the device rapidly boot loops with a chime every 2-3 seconds during which the internal display is blank with backlight, SMC bypass, reset, etc. has no effect on this behavior. When the screen is unplugged (Testing bare board, no SSD, only speaker connected) the device only chimes once and then seems to hang forever, no question mark folder on external display (but it does recognize that an input is connected when the device starts), no caps lock, boot current seems normal until it settles in at 500-600mA and remains there. A quick check of all coils shows no major shorts, I'm starting to wonder about an SMC issue? Am I correct in thinking that the flashing question mark should show on an external display with no SSD installed, or is this limited to the internal display?"

You need to select journaling when formatting the drive.\n\nInstalled MacOS Yosemite onto an external SSD with internet recovery and booted successfully, but the device is completely unaware of the internal SSD.\n\nSpent 2 hours trying to update the instillation on the external SSD to numerous macOS versions, which failed because a \"firmware partition was not present on the drive\", complete waste of time don't do this. Error is related to the internal SSD being in a bad mood.\n\nCreated a MacOS High Sierra bootable installer with files downloaded by DosDude's patcher using the official create instillation media command. Don't try to make a newer installer from Yosemite unless you enjoy undocumented error messages related to the application path flags you must append.\n\nBooted from the High Sierra installer, and suddenly the internal SSD shows up, properly formatted as MacOS Extended Journaled and everything, so no clue why it couldn't see it before, but now it can be re-formatted and installed to normally."
