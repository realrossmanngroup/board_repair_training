Machine keeps trying to start like this and fails.\n\nFas spins for few seconds then turns off.\n\nKeeps trying to boot.\n\nAfter 5-7 attempts it boots normally.\n\nOn DC meter it pulls around .6A then goes to 0 on each failed boot attempt, then stabilizes at around .3A when successfully boots.\n\nWondering if someone recognizes these symptoms and can tell me where to check next, i'm relatively new at this.\n\nThank you."

Upon another inspection of the board I see solder balls coming out of the side of bios chip U6100.  Would a bad U6100 cause these types of symptoms?\n\nAlso I understand you cant simply change these, there is a process involved regarding \"ME Region\" (?)"
