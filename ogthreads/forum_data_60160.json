I tried flux and heat on ram chips @ 200C. they are all getting 1.365V. \n\nFlex cable on this mac is sketchy but I'm guessing there can't be any relevance to the ram voltage or connection? Have a new flex coming soon for it I didn't have any spare for this specific model.\n\nCan you reFLOW ram chips?"
