            "message": "Good day friends, \n\nI have actually this board here and I don't really know where to start to search. Sometimes it power on with apple logo and it is booting with full fan speed and very slow. Sometimes it is drawing current about 600-700mA fan full speed and nothing happens no screen. Tried to make diagnose but it hangs in the last minute. When it not turns on I leave it over night, then I can turn on 2-3 times. Also not possible turn on with battery. Sometimes when turn on a questionmark appears for 1-2 second and the it is booting. So maybe something wrong with ssd. I checked \n\nPPBUS_G3H_SSD0 = 12,6V \nPP2V7_NAND_SSD0 = 2,55V \nPP1V8_SSD0 = 1,8V \nPP0V9_SSD0 = 0,9V"

C7020 and C7023 is both about 2,5 ohms. SMC_AVREF = 1,25V\n\nBott in safe not possible, it is loading till 70% and then it stuck. Today I got it one time to boot up to login screen of course with fan full speed and very slow everything. So far with this problem I was always able to boot up and check with software which sensor is bad. Without booting this will be hard"
