            "message": "I bought a dead device on local ebay. Water indicators are all red, it was really sodomized by someone around Q7010 (PPDCIN_G3H_ISOL), D7010 was soldered reverse, C7590 and C7572 were also cracked of the board.\nThe board autostarts only with battery attached, goes to 0.25A(old battery is probably dead, with the good one it looks generally the same after it was charged to 100%),\nNo bell/image, PCH is getting warm.\nBIOS reflash does not make any difference. All Power rails seem to be present, VCORE is 1.7V and stable.\nEDP_BKLT_EN is not present, no short.\nI do not see any activity on Bios chip, also nothing on SPI_MLB_CLK.\nLPC_CLK24M_SMC is present.\nDead PCH, good luck changing SoC chip?"
