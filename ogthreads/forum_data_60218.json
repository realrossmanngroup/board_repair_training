CPU gets warm but not hot."

It stopped working a while back, and he just stopped using it and got a new one. He eventually gave it to me so I could take a look, just in case I could revive it.\nHe said it just stopped working one day, it wouldn't turn on anymore.\nHe also said that it was possible that there could have been a bit of liquid spill at some point, but wasn't too sure.\nAnd after taking the board out of the case, I don't think there was any liquid ingress, the board looks perfectly clean after inspection under microscope. No sign of liquid or corrosion anywhere.\n\nI have not tried messing with the BIOS yet, but this was indeed on the top of my list after I did the first analysis I posted up there. But I wanted to get some other opinion first. So you think I should try reflashing a clean BIOS ?"

I know ME region is not compatible and so on, but I think it shouldn't matter and I should at least be able to boot with it.\nBut it didn't work, still stuck at 180mA 20V, except that I noticed something which I didn't pay attention to before. It does a few boot loops 180mA, back to about 20mA and then tries again, 180mA, and so on a few times, until it stays at 180mA."
