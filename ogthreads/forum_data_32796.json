            "message": "This 820-2523 sometimes turns on but mostly it is dead. Sometimes it turns on but has a black screen. Except for a lot of smokey black dust the board looks fine. I checked power rails and PP5_S3 is missing. After i disconnected the charger it is shortet (0.02V in diode mode) but it is slowly recovering as long as the board is off. It comes back to 0.4V. If i plug the charger back in and disconnect it again it is shorted again. I injected voltage and U7201 was getting hot. I replaced it twice but still the same. Also the same happens to PP3V3_S5. Now i am stuck here..."

Seeing it is intermittent it could very well be corrosion under something. But is could be anything really, not looking good for this antique."
