            "message": "Waterdamage on U7000, traces to R7021, R7022 were corroded away, both burned to megaohm resistance.\nAfter replacing ISL and both resistors i got a fan spin as well as a smell of burned R7021/R7022 resistors. No shorted caps in this circuit, resistance to ground is also OK.\nNo shorts on charging/InRush MosFets, R7020 is also OK.\ni feel dumb as i do not get why it sucks almost 0.5 Amp in CHG_CSI_N. R7005 was also replaced since it was 40 Ohm instead of 20. Could not find ISL6258 datasheet with a logic diagram, so i have no idea where should i look."
