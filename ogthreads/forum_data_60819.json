            "message": "Hello, i have a 820-3115-B that initially didnt turn on, \n\nFirst there was corrosion on C7528, i replaced it but pin 1 was gone from the corrosion so i ran a wire from pin 1 to pin 1 of C7523\n\nPPBUS_G3H was 1V and i located a short on C7121. After replacing C7121 there was fan spin.\n\nAfter assembling the mac and turning it on it chimed and LCD turned on. Then it suddenly shut off. \n\nAfter that it no longer turned on and it only has quarter fan spin.\n\nR7402/3 are both good and U7400 looks great ."
