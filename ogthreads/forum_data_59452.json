That is a 820-4924\nFor the other case it works fine and working with the battery it does it, it suddenly turns off and then you can turn it back on with no problem, the model of the mother board is: 820-3476 (I\u00b4m sorry I started the post with other model....) I have 2 boards with this problem, it is not thermal paste or anything to do with software... is there a common problem for this boards?"
