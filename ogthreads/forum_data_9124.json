            "message": "HISTORY: board previously worked on, fucked-up connector, shorted back-light circuit, PPVOUT_SW_LCDBKLT also shorted to ground.\n\nPROBLEM: no display, but have display on external screen.\nCleared short on backlight, got backlight but no display. Replaced connector, lost back-light, going to trouble shoot it again tomorrow.\nAND the connector has same # of pins but different anchors, worked before. Is it a problem?\n\nU9000 was nicked, I replaced it. Then tested and found 3.33V on PINS 2,3;  0V on PIN 1 = LCD_IG_PWR_EN = LVDS_IG_PANEL_PWR = L_VDD_EN (out) from U1800; 0V on remaining PINS of U9000.\n\nFirst (dumb question): display must be connected to get this voltage, like for backlight?  I tried two displays, but not sure I have a known good anymore and getting new one tomorrow. Asking to buy time till I get the new display.\n\nTwo, PP3V3_S5 is 360 OHM to ground, and donor board is giving me more than 2K. Is this a problem or part of my problem?\n\nThree, U1800 needs an input somewhere to output L_VDD_EN?\n\nFour: any usual suspects when we have no display on this model?\n\nALSO, I tried searching for previous posts, but got 0 results. Is the search engine down?\n\nTIA!"
