            "message": "hello dudes! got an interesting board here. 820-00850 board. had short to GND on L7660. injected 1V there and found a shorted cap C7895. removed and short gone. board still does not power on. some ports take 20V, some 5V, no other shorts. no liquid damage. when 20V on charger, I get around 2V on F7000 and 0.01A power draw, when 5V on charger I get 12.24V on F7000(?!?!?!) and 0A draw. I found that PPVRTC is not being generated. Any hints on what to look? The board is absolutely clean, no corrosion anywhere nor any signs of liquid, it was almost even dust free. I'm lost now! Thanks in advance"
