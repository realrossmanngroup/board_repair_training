            "message": "None of the 4 ports are boot looping. All of them are at 5.15V and 0 amps. None of the caps around CD3215's appear to be blown. Was getting 0V at PP3v3_G3H but I've replaced: C6906, U6903, C6910 and D6902 and now I do get 3.4V at PP3v3_G3H but diode reading I think is slightly high at .487 red to ground. Also I get a diode reading at C6906 of .544 which I believe according to FlexBV should be OL both of those had those same diode values prior to replacing components. Components were pulled from board that started but dead CPU.\n\nNo known incidents with board. Very slight corrosion at RB261, RB260, RB264 & RB310 all those values check out ok and reflowed with flux. slight corrosion at R3110/1, R5322 and C3106 - all values check out, diode at c3106 is .526 also reflowed with flux.\n\nU6903:\n1- 7.9V\n2 - 4.9V\n3 - 3.4V\n8 - 4.9V\n9 - 1V\n10 - 5V\n\nAny thoughts other than just simply going after swapping either U3100, UB300 or both?"

            "message": "You shouldn't worry about U6903, if you get now correct 3V3_G3H voltage.\nBe sure R6915 is good.\n\nCompare diode mode readings of LDO lines between all CD3215 chips.\nALso check if you get all these voltages.\nBe aware, 1V1 LDO appears on powered port only.\nYou probably need to change/reball the CD3215 chips from corroded areas."
