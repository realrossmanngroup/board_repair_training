As a side note for background, the laptop was dropped what was described as less than 6 inches causing this issue. This board is mine now, I prefer not to learn on customer boards.\n\nIt might be obvious but I will state it anyway:\ng3 hot: present\nPP3V42: reads 3.38v (slightly varies depending on where I measure but no more than .02v - .03v)\nPPDCIN: reads 16.5v ish"

            "message": "A drop typically points to a damaged BGA or a crack inside the board internally which you will not be able to see which makes it a bad candidate for learning. Even for more experienced people like Duke & I these usually wind up in the trash heap.\n\nThat being said, troubleshooting should begin by checking all the rails and seeing what is missing. See if any of them have short circuits on them, come back with what is missing. Does PM_SLP_S4_L pulse when you plug the charger in? It will be very quick so you'll want to have someone else plug it in while you have your hands on the meter probes to catch it."
