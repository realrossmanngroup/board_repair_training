            "message": "Hi. I am working on a 820-3476 board with no power. All S5 rails are present but missing S4 and below. I found that PM_SLP_S4 is missing so I traced that back to the CPU. Found that PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK is missing. Checked for ALL_SYS_PWRGD is missing as well. Based on schematic, this signal is generated by U8160 but on the board its NC. Now I am lost. Any ideas ?"
