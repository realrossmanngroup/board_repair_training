Any idea what might cause a startup loop like this? Slight spill on right side of board toward the display connector, down by the headphone jack and some down by the battery connector. I can't see any sign of corrosion but the sensors are tripped red. No visibly-damaged components. Gave it an ultrasonic cleaning."

Also no problems unless you use JUNK Chinese chargers...\n\nInspect trackpad cable and TP for corrosion.[/QUOTE]\n\nI stand by what i stated\n\nI actually use a bench supply (tektronix PWS2326)  on original charger cables for most my testing. It allows you to easily see how much current is being drawn by the entire system, and quickly narrow down issues (similar to checking rails with diode mode). I see no problem why a good quality bench supply with original apple charger leads would cause any problems.\n\nAnyhow we tested it using several original apple chargers (including the one it shipped with) and still ran into issues with it booting without a battery installed (IIRC)\n\nIt also wouldnt make sense that it was my power source as the 2015 15\" retina pulls less current than 6Amps, yet it was shutting down during boot until i fitted a new battery. \n\nunless you can state to me exactly why my setup would have caused this issue im not going to believe it."

I posted this last time: [url]https://www.rossmanngroup.com/boards/forum/board-repair-troubleshooting/4925-820-00163-2015-macbook-pro-15-restarting-during-boot[/url]\n\nIt feels identical. It feels like I have a perfectly good computer as far as measurements and everything else, and then, the restart during boot.\n\nUsing a standard 85W genuine adapter.\n\nWhen it does boot (without trackpad plugged in) I'm seeing a bad battery. Stuck at 22%. Not charging and not working off of it. Weirdly, the keyboard stops working too when the trackpad is unplugged. Odd.\n\nI'll update tomorrow. I have another 2015 Retina 15\" showing up tomorrow so I'll have some more parts to mess with. Hopefully I'll have another battery and trackpad/cable to work with."

(I did see it boot once, but every other time they would stop booting and restart.)\n\u2022 both will boot when trackpad is unplugged. (tested this with both trackpads.) also, the keyboard stops functioning for both when the trackpad is unplugged.\n\u2022 both boot normally when plugged into a good battery\n\nThanks a ton for the tips.
