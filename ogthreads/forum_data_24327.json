I have tons of donor boards, but am having trouble finding a suitable 220 uf replacement that isn't tantalum.\n\nAny suggestions? Or am I going to have to order one?"

            "message": "Random shutdowns, especially when stressing GPU. So is this more likely to just be a straight-up GPU issue then? I'm curious too...what is different about the 2849 board that makes C9560 a non-issue? At first glance, it appears the only major difference is a 220uf cap instead of 330.\n\nFor what it's worth, just for shits and giggles I replaced C9560 with another tantalum cap last night. Ran FurMark for 2 hours, no shutdowns. Streamed a YouTube video overnight, still running this morning. Is it more likely that heating the board took care of the issue temporarily than C9560 having been the root of the issue?"
