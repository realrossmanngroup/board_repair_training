            "message": "Hi all,\n\nI did send an email to the Rossman guys but sadly, they don't get alot of these in the shop to know how what is specifically wrong. Do any of you know of a schematic anywhere? There is an option to replace the whole board but it's kinda sad... as the board is pristine minus 2 areas I've identified. Basically, if you see the images, you'll see how the display is at the moment, and where on the logic board there seems to have been a bit of damage - this was a minor water spill that was cleaned up pretty quick but sadly it seems there was a bit of an effect on functionality.\n\nI've tried resoldering the KO 27618K945 chip (not that I am entirely sure what that chip is/does) as there was a bit of corrosion and the soldering looked cracked, but the only other form of damage I can see is potentially in the area shown in the images. I don't know what area this is as I don't have the schematic and neither do I know where to get one from.... but it seems to me maybe the cap and the fuse are damaged a bit? Would this not cause the whole display to fail though? It seems odd how the display is the way it is and I'm trying to find out where the failure could be coming from.\n\nAny help would be massively appreciated."

Now.. since there's no place I can get a 16 inch screen for the laptop unless I go to Apple, which, with this Coronavirus, isn't an option, is there a small chance that maybe I could try cleaning the LCD ribbon pins? Might that help?"
