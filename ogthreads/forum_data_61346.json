            "message": "Another board I am a bit baffled with. 820-3437 (2013). Stuck at the beginning with this one as PP3v42 is at 2.8v. \n\nNo magsafe light but then it DOES get a magsafe light, but voltage stays at 2.8v\n\nThat suggests something is draining it.  Scratching my head with this one. Ther was some liquid damage in the past around U5110 by the discolouration of the cap and resistors, so I replaced U5110 and all components there as a matter of course. Same.\n\nI have also reballed the SMC as there was some signs of alcohol cleaning that had been done around there, so just to be sure. Same.\n\nI would be happy for any pointers to get me started on this one. I know it is old and not worth much, but it would be nice to get tuis one working all the same."

            "message": "Thanks for your input again.\n\nYes, that is interesting regarding Vout. I am assuming that because there is a limit of 300ma and the resistnace has not changed, then the chip must be implimenting ohms law and choking the voltage.\n\nSo, removed C7095 - voltage dropped to 1.6v.\n\nRepolaced C7095 with new, back to 2.8v\n\nRemoved and checked R7095 and R7096, both tested exactly correct at 349k and 198k (my multimeter is not that accurate, but those numbers are good IMHO). Put those back.\n\nSo concluded it must be U7090 ad replaced U7090 and now have 3.42 back. At the moment board is drawing 109ma, so time for a list of testing, but I did briefly check and have ppbus_G3H as well as the 5v and 3.3v rails. Also magsafe light now, so making progress........"
