It's definitely possible.\n\nIt's odd too because we sold a good one to someone who claimed it killed their logic board. I found this extremely difficult to believe, but he claimed it happened twice. After receiving it back, I plugged it into a good board and it worked fine and has worked fine ever since. Who knows. Either way, I don't work on these so I'll just sell them as-is and get rid of them."
