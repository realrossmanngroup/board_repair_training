            "message": "Good morning, \n\nNo signs of liquid damage. When I received the board, only one of the USB-C Ports was working, I replaced the CD3215 with a correct C00 version and now both ports work. Prior to replacing the CD3215 PP3V3_G3H was at 2.1v, not it's at 4.8v. However, the device still does not turn on. \n\nWith the battery removed:\n\npp3v3_s5  0.1mV\npp1v8_s5g 0.0\npp3v3_G3H 4.83v\nppbus_g3h_cpu 40mV\nppbus_g3h 40.3mV\npp20v_usbc_xa_usbx-Ca_vBus_conn 5.1v\npp3v3_ldo3v - 0.6mV\n\nI reflowed U7800 since it seemed like this would be the problem area, but still no dice. Any help appreciated. Thank you"
