            "message": "Hi all,\n\nThis board had a small liquid spill close to battery connector. - symptoms are that it can see the battery but displays replace now and will not charge.\nData lines are okay i assume as it can see the battery.\nBattery is a KG OEM.\n\nI've replaced the following:\n\nISL\nAll caps and resistors on CHGR_VCOMP line\nQ7155 --> pin 5 is 2.2v? (pins 1-3 12.60, pin 4 12.56)\nR7150 due to liquid along with C7145\nC7155\nC7156\nC7157\n\nResistance on pins 17/18 of ISL are: 3.3 ohms (seems high?)\nResistance on pins 27/28 of ISL are: 21.2 ohms\n\nCertainly confused now - any ideas?"
