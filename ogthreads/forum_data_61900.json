            "message": "Hi guys, \nThis is my first time working on this board... \nStuck on 5V 0,1A.\nI have short on PPBUS_G3H. Removed F7000.\nNon more short on Pin 1, Pin 2 still shorted.\nI ordered a PSU to inject voltage , meanwhile ... there's something that I can do to go further on diagnosis?\n\nAccording to boardview , pin 2 of F7000 is connected to 12 caps and a few sense resistor. I know that is a boring work but how about desolder all those components to find which one is shorted?\n\nI really don't have much experience with USB-C machines so I apologize if i'm saying stupid things. :)\nThank you in advance."
