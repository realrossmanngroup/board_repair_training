            "message": "Hey guys,\n\nHave a 820-2936-B Macbook Pro here with some frustrating issues. We get a green light on the AC adapter however, no fanspin/chime, and the CPU and GPU start to get hot (could be due to lack of fan spin?)\n\nChecked all of the voltages, the only outlier is PPVIN_SW_T29BST, which is 2.82V. (see attached image for all voltages)\n\nFrom this I checked Q3880 as this seem to be where it's made, PPBUS_G3H is a steady 12.6V and the gaet for Q3880 is 12.2V. At the drain of Q3880 however, the voltage is a meager 0.3V. I replaced Q3880 to no effect.\n\nDiode mode to ground at drain of Q3880 is 0.4V (only works with negative on component, positive on ground? I've not noticed this with other components when diode checking, or maybe I'm going mad), resistance is 100kohmn (slowly goes down),\n\nConsequentially, PP15V_T29 is 0.32V\n\nPlus, I am going to assume that PP5V_S5 is supposed to be 5V given the name, my schematic shows 3.3V however so for consistency, I still put 3.3V.\n\nHelp would be appreciated!"
