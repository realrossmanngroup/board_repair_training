            "message": "Hi there!\n\nGot a pristine MacBook here, basically has all the signs of booting except it doesn't. The only sign of corrosion is on the BIOS chip itself. Pulled the chip, cleaned and placed back. Same issue.\nSo I'm thinking I should replace BIOS, but I don't know how that works. I need some sort of programmer to program serial right? I use NAND programmers for iPhones but have never dealt with a BIOS programming. Also, can I use a BIOS chip from a 13 inch air instead and program that?\n\nThanks!"
