            "message": "Hey all, have a water damaged board that has no backlight. There wasn't any corrosion or red pads when I got it, and it doesn't look like anyone has tried working on it. I verified that there's a display, just no backlight.\n\nF9700 was blown, so I replaced it, and now get a green light but no power. I'm getting a short to ground somewhere along the line now.\n\nIf I remove R0910, since it's before the BKL_EN line for U9701 but doesn't remove BKL_EN, it powers on just fine. But that means that it'll boot when I kill PPBUS_SW_BKL. All the caps seem to be fine from there to the LCD connector J9000, but something is obviously shorting. What is the SW0 and SW1 do?"
