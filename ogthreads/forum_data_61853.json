            "message": "This Macbook Came in  when i connect to USB amp meter , its stuck at 5.09V  0.89W and 0.16 amp , I proceeded to open it to check the CD3215 Chips and found at UB300  CB300 was full shorted to Ground , I managed to remove the CB300 and replaced it ,  I plugged again my USB AMP METER and the Behaviour remains the same ,  I tested  CB300 again and  resistance value to ground was normal .366 OHM  , I Thought it might've been CB300 Was probably defective so i went ahead and changed it to a new one and behaviour still the same , So what i did i changed all the 4 CB3215 Chips to new ones and the behaviour never changed I have  measured R7020  and my 5v is there,  when I checked the LDOS \n\nU3100\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD = 0.020\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC = 0.448\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO = 3.350\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA = 1.813\n\nU3200\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD = 1.796\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC = 0.023\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO = 3.355\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA = 1.804\n\nUB300\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD = 1.815\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC =0.021\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO = 3.216\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA = 0.23\n\nUB400\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD = 1.815\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC =0.230\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO = 3.216\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOA =1.796\n\n\nI was checking on the forum and seeing that someone else that you are helping is having my same issue , another thing  , since those chips come with strong underfill while removing the CD3215 I lost all the NC's pads and they left no trace at all i am not sure if they are NOT CONNECTED  or please advice \n\nThank you"
