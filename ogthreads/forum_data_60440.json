Anyway, U3100 had a couple of LDO caps shorted to nearly 0V. I pulled them to check if it was the caps but it was U3100. Changed it and went well and shorts were gone but I was drawing 0 amps. I swapped the chip again... same thing? I'm not understanding what's happened. The chip swap went very smoothly. Chips I have already had balls so all i had to do was clean pads and flux and solder on. I've rechecked the area to see if anything moved or chips gone or anything (even though I have zero reason to think anything happened) and not seeing or understanding a reason why I'm not drawing anything. Checked fuses near the CD3215's and they're all good."
