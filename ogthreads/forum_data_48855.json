            "message": "So I've been reading about the shutdown problems of the 2013-2014 models. 3 possible solutions are suggested by the internet:\n1) Removing the kext responsible for ethernet over thunderbolt\n2) Using the nocrashmbp utility made by RealMacMods\n3) Replacing the VCORE driver FDMF6808 for a 6708. \n\nNumber 2 and 3 seem to address a similar root cause of entering faulty power state. Number 1 does not seem to be related (?), but fixes the problem for a lot of users.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Are we looking at 1 single problem or are things being confused on the internet?\n2) Do we know the root cause(s) and how to differentiate between them?\n3) VCORE driver replacement seems to be the way to go for a 820-3662 with random shutdowns. Agree?\n4) Which board are affected by this problem / these problems?"

According to Duke, it's def an issue with the fets tho. Seems like the dual graphics also get CPU issues from flexion not just the fets."
