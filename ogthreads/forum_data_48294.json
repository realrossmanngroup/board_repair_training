            "message": "Hi there! I know these are a pain to do due to the lack of schematics and board views. Had quite some damage on the trackpad connector so have replaced that perfectly, however I have noticed that so many lines are short on the trackpad which I'm pretty sure are not meant to be ground. When plugging in the trackpad with new cable, the computer will end in a boot loop. so it will start only with that disconnected. \n\nAnd for the keyboard there is a chip on the other side of the board which on similar models is in charge of keyboard functionality, that looks toasty. However, I'm not sure if I can use some of my donors from other models?"
