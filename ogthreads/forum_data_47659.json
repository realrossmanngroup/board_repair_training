            "message": "Morning \n\nDealing with a board that doesn't power up. PP5V_S0 is missing, well it pulses from 0 to about 0.22V with R8151 in the circuit. Once i removed R8151, i now had a steady 5v for PP5V_S0. So i put R8151 back in the circuit, replaced C8159 with the same result, no 5v. I pulled Q8150 to eliminate the circuit being fed by it, and still wasn't getting 5v on PP5V_S0. All resistor measurements are good, and the only capacitor in the circuit wasn't shorted but i replaced it just as well. My confusion is why won't the 5v return when Q8150 is removed, since the only components on that line is 3 resistor, a capacitor and the bjt."
