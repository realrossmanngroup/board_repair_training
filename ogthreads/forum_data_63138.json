            "message": "I got an water damaged MacBook Air A2179 with 820-01958 board.\n\nThe liquid affected areas were (pictures in attachments):\n[LIST]\n[*]USB-C controllers and D3302/3322\n[*]Q8401/ R8400 along with with backlight caps\n[*]U6500 area\n[*]Trackpad electronics\n[*]Audio board connector eaten away as always\n[*]J6100 had some corrosion\n[*]Water stains at left bottom corner of LCD\n[/LIST]\nSo I have replaced all damaged SMD components, reballed USB-C controllers, repaired trackpad and audio board, replaced J6100. After that computer turns on and works normally but time to time screen goes black by itself and not turning back on. The same when I close the lid and open it, backlight won\u2019t appear, but computer is working. What I have done so far:\n[LIST]\n[*]Tried new Audio board with new flex cable\n[*]Tried new right speaker with LID sensor\n[*]Tried new mic/ LID sensor cable which goes under left speaker\n[*]Tried new trackpad and trackpad flex cable\n[*]Tried new LCD assembly\n[*]Tried with keyboard disconnected\n[/LIST]\nU4850 / U4802 areas were inspected -  no damages found there, resistors around have correct values, there is continuity between all resistors in that circuit.\n\nI\u2019m on my leave now and don\u2019t have board around, so I will write aproximate measurements which I remember, but they aren\u2019t 100% correct. Tomorrow I\u2019ll be in the office and update if necessary\n\nSMC_LID_LEFT reads ~0,350V (diode mode)\nSMC_LID_RIGHT reads ~0,350V (diode mode)\n\nWhen lid is open SMC_LID_LEFT is 1,8V but SMC_LID_RIGHT is 0,9V and the backlight is present. Wen I close the lid both are 0V, and after opening they read 1,8 and 0,9V again but there is no backlight on the screen.\n\nIf I put computer to sleep mode from the system without closing the lid computer wakes up with backlight after pressing any button on keyboard. But if I will close the lid and open it up in some time computer wakes up without backlight."
