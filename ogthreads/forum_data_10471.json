Board turns on, chime and everything but no image or backlight. I replaced connector second time to make sure that I got it right.\n\nGpu has power,  \n=PP3V3_S5_LCD - present \nLVDS_DDC_CLK - present \nLVDS_DDC_DATA - present\n\nPP3V3_SW_LCD - 0 but it should be 3. \n\nIt looks like board doesnt detect LCD, so I ordered new lcd and flex. Tested and  get the same result, no image or backlight. \nIs there way to check if lcd being recognized? perhaps I got defective screen/flex?\n\nOr what other signals do I need to check for image? all lines on the connector are present, no short"

Pin 3 has low resistance to ground 0.565k, 0.122 diod mode. I still get 3v3 volts there, while screen pluged in.\n\nI dont have other 820-3330 motheboard but I compare to other two 15\" boards and readings are complitly different, normal ~0.500 in diod mode. THis readings are with or without U9000, so it comes from power rail, any suggestions if thats the clue or it is normal?\nIs possible that 3v3 is present but current is low so it doesn't power the chip?\nI have replaced U9000 just in case."
