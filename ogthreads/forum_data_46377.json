            "message": "This 820-2879 was waterdamage. It has a green light but wont turn on. Water hit the U6990 area - not to bad and not much. I fixed that but still no live. I had a few of those already and from experience often the MCP has problems. So i jus want a confirmation here, thats its a dead MCP (even if i hope its not) as PM_SPL_S4_L is missing and resistance to GND on 3V42 (R6995 Pin 1) is just 95 Ohms (but green light is still there...)."
