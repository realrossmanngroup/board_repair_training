I put all the components back and fixed the ticking. One of the components missing was the BIOS chip and so I need to put new one on. I already ordered a new one from China but I have no experience with cleaning the ME region or whatever is necessary to get this to work. I would like to know what kind of tools I need for this and how this is done. This is probably kind of a big question but I need to start somewhere.\n\nBest Regards,\nJoep"

I had a 2009 2.53 with similar stripped down issues. I replaced the SPI ROM with one from ebay, that was already \"programmed\" and was good to go. If it is a 2009, if I am correct, there is no ME region to worry about. I believe that is only the core i5/i7 series beginning in 2011 for 13\" and 2010 for 15\" models...\n\nYou could also buy a donor, hole in the board, board from china and it usually is stated if the BIOS is on there and you can just pull it right off. Just make sure the EMC and processor match...\n\nSomeone else step in, IF  I am completely wrong."

I would also need a step by step instruction on how to do this, I've seen a video where somebody does this but it's not easy. Because putting a new file in the bios is not enough right? You would also have to put in the corresponding serial number. I would would very much like to learn this."
