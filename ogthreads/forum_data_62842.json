            "message": "Hello. This board came to me with no life. Shorted 3V3 line. Corrected that problem and the board started. Everything works fine except for USB/Thunderbolt/HDMI. I have a Satechi USB-C hub here which I use on all my personal Macs and use it to test all costumer's Mac, So I know it's working fine. But on this particular board, I can charge the Mac using the USB-C port on the hub on both ports but USB/HDMI don't work. Well, they kind of work, just on EFI. If I press option during boot, USB drives mount on boot selection screen, but when the system starts loading it loses communication. If I leave it connected for 10 minutes or so, it starts loading the installer again and completes boot. Same if I start MacOS. If I connect the hub with a USB drive attached to it the system does not recognize it, but after 10 minutes connected the drive magically mounts and starts working. If I unplug it and plug it again it will work only after 10 minutes connected again. HDMI never works. BUT, with a much less sophisticated USB-C to USB adapter from TPLINK I have here, USB works on one port but not on the other. I already replaced both CD3215 and thunderbolt controller (U2800) and tried flashing BIOS. Same thing. Any ideas?"
