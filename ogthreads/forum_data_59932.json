            "message": "Hello, this is my first post. I've been reading and learning from you guys a lot. I've been repairing phones for long time, then months ago I decided to jump to MacBooks repair.\nI got this water damaged MacBook air which my main question is about Q7630 which is blown and because of the way it is, I'm wondering if worth it to troubleshoot it, if you pay attention to the picture you will see that there might be some damaged layer below, actually if I connect the charger orange light comes on but it doesn't charge, another question is about where to buy the part, I can only find it from China and it would take a long time to arrive. there are some other resistors and caps corroded too please see the pic and give me your professional advice. \n\nBR\n\nHosoi"

I'm first going to talk with the customer if he agrees then I'll try my best to do what you suggested if not then I'll give it back to the customer. I'll also recommend the get another MLB instead since I don't want to spend too much time on that. Thanks and sorry for the quote in my previous post.\n\nBR"
