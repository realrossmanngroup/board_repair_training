            "message": "Okay Duke, I have another 820 4924 with no power, put to much to into the last one, ended up no fix. This one was liquid damaged. Shop the brought it in was nice enough to clean it before the brought it over. Their tech did indicate corrosion around SMC. Magsafe lights, 12.59ppbus g3h, s5 rails are present, missing S4, and just like the last board P5VS4_EN is missing. Checked all lines for short, also just like last board resistance is low on CPU VCORE. This time I'm only getting 9.4ohms. To answer your question from the last issuse, I checked resistance on V core off of a donor board, and got around 23ohms."
