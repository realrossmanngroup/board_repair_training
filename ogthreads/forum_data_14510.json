Found, replaced and it looked like everything was fine.\n\nHowever I now have another issue... the battery is recognized and apparently charging but it doesn't stay on battery.\n\nPPVBAT_G3H_CONN is 8.6V with the charger plugged but 1.4V when charger unplugged even after hours.\nBattery is shown as being charged to 80% but still, 1.4V is getting out through PPVBAT_G3H_CONN\n\nAny thoughts please?"
