U7320 was shorted.\n\nAfter read various threads, i  know i shouldn't use FDMF6808N from Aliexpress.\nBut just in case, and because i don't have the other IC versions, i replaced U7320 with one IC i bough on Aliexpress. Now fans are spinning, but no image and all 3 cpu phase are at 1.7V steady.\n\nCaps lock doesn't turn on a green light, so i suppose, no CPU activity. And like we talked about yesterday in the other thread, cpu core should drop to 0.6V .\n\nSo, this could mean CPU damaged by shorted U7320? Or should i try with 3 new FDMF3030?"
