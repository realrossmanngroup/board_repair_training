            "message": "Have this board that at the beginning was shutting down very randomly. Had a minor hint of liquid on C2643. Replaced it, and its still shutting down very randomly. Come to find out that its not so random after all.\nWhen board is plugged in and its running, if i tap my finger in the U7600 section thats when it shuts down. I have reflowed the area and I dont really see how tapping on that are would cause the shutdown because its not a BGA chip. Unless its actually a solder ball under the RAM chip or the CPU that is damaged and the tapping in this area is actually causing  the shutdown. I have tapped on the RAM chips themselves with no shutdown. Not sure what to do here. Should I try to reflow the RAM closest to U7600?\n\n\nThanks"
