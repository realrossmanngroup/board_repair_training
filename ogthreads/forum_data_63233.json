Checked the following and noticed 2.8v missing at  PWM Pin voltage at the 2 Pin of the resistor R7704.  \nMeasured the VIN voltage through capacitor C7710 - 5V.\nMeasured the VDDIO voltage through capacitor C7711 - 3.3V\nMeasured the EN Pin voltage at the 2 Pin of the resistor R7731 - 2.8V.\nMeasured the PWM Pin voltage at the 2 Pin of the resistor R7704 -  Missing\nMeasured the SCLK voltage at the 2 Pin of the resistor R7753 - 3.3V\nMeasured the SDA voltage at the 2 Pin of the resistor R7757 - 3.3V.. \nReplaced U7701 - No change..\n\nWhat next?"
