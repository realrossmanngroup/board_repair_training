(can feel now taptic is clicking.)\ni did some voltage testing everything is normal excepts on pp1v8_sus is missing did also diode testing is not shorted. \nalso tried replace u7800 from donor board (same board model number)\nbtw:measured also pp1v8_sus before i tooked u7800 from this donor board is present.\n\nkinda no idea whats the next step. \nTIA"
