            "message": "This board started out with quarter fan spin. I noticed that one of the SPI_MLB_CS_L resistors was missing and when replaced the board turned on but a day or so later the quarter fan was back. \n\nWhen heat was applied to the U6100 area the board would turn on so I dumped the rom thinking the chip was failing, cleaned the ME etc. wrote to a new chip and it turned on as expected. A bit later quarter fan was back and persists unless heat is applied to Q7920, Q7931, U6100 area.\n\nAny thoughts?"
