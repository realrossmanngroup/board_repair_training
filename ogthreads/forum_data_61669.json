            "message": "Hello,\n\nI have a MacBook A1706 EMC 3163 which had screen damage where there was a 2 inch vertical section of the screen that was completely black with a little bit of static / grainy screen which I haven't really noticed until a little later. Replacing the screen got rid of it, but what remains is a grainy display like the one shown in this link here: [URL]https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/639484/MacBook+Pro+2017+screen+flickering+-+glitching+-+has+horizontal+lines[/URL]\n\n\nI can confirm that it is not a defective screen because I put the replacement screen on a known good working MacBook and the grainy screen disappears. I also tried one other replacement screen - same thing.\n\nIt is likely that there is issues on the motherboard itself. I have a LCD cable coming in to rule it out. Has anyone experienced this one before and solved it?\n\nThanks in advance."
