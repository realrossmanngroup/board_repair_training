            "message": "I've got what I think is an odd situation. Green light on magsafe is not completely steady on, it pulses briefly and consistently. Same with SMC_PM_G2_EN it ranges from 1.7 to 3.4.  And DCIN fluctruates a little 16.5-16.8. I've changed SMC and U7941. With U7941 removed, SMC_PM_G2EN and DCIN are steady. I also changed Q7080/5 prior thinking that was related to DCIN values not steady. It's almost like something is causing the board to completely shut down and restart? Like even the sysonewire is resetting or something.  I also tried running from power supply instead of Magasafe and that keeps DCIN steady but still unsteady SMC_PM_G2_EN.  SMC Bypass doesn't change anything."
