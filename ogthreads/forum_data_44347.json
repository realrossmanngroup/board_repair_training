In OS it is slow, mouse works normal however.\n\nDoesn't start automatically when charger is connected.\nDoesn't react when Power button is pressed.\nJ4800 is clean."

I gotta grab another keyboard to turn it on then.\n\nR7121/22 and R7151/52 measure good, including pins on ISL.\n\nOn PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC I get 16 Ohms. (Marked in attached picture) Doesn't sound right? \n\nIt leads back to U5110, which is responsible for SMC Reset \"Button\". I get 0.4V on PP3V3_S5_AVREF_SMC. So first check caps on that raiil since damage is around SMC area and better yet, they're not even changed. Whoever worked on before, probably didn't think it mattered?"
