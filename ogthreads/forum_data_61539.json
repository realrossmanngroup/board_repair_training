            "message": "I\u2019m new to repair. I am a laid off newspaper photographer looking for a transition to a different career. I\u2019ve done pretty well so far. I started with G4 Powerbooks and progressed to 2010\u2019s MacBook Pros and Airs  I usually buy broken MacBooks on eBay to learn, practice and repair. My latest purchases has been a 2013 MacBook Air 11\u201d a1465 and 2011 13\u201d a1369. \n\nMy question today is with the MacBook Air 11\u201d with the 820-3435 board. I know the MacBook Air no backlight issue is not new, but I could use some guidance. \n\nI get green light, boot and chime, but no backlight. I do get an image and can see a blinking folder if I shine a light behind the screen. I thought it would be a simple change of U7701, but no. I still have no backlight. The screen connector cable has no damage, nor is there damage to the LVDS connector on the board. \n\nLVDS connector pin 18 and 19 - 3.32v - pin 3 and 4 - .001v\nC8317 -    pin 1-  PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT - .001v\nD7701 -    pin 2 - PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT - .001v\n                  pin 1 - LCDBKLT_BOOST - .001v    \nC7799 -    pin 1 - PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT - .001v\nL7701 -     pin 1 - PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT - .001v\n                  pin 2 - LCDBKLT_BOOST - .001v\nF7700 -     pin 1 - PPBUS_G3H - 8.58v\n                  pin 2 - PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLTFET - 8.58v\nR7715 -     pin 1 - BLK_EN - .001v\nR7731 -     pin 1 - BLK_EN - .001v\n\nThere is continuity and no broken traces between D7701 pin 1 to L7701 pin 2 or the test pad near by. \n\nI know there is something I am missing, but can\u2019t seem to find the issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
