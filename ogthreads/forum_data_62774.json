            "message": "Hello, \n\nThis macbook came in today not booting , I plugged my amp amp meter and Device is charging normal pulling 20V 39W and 1.48 Amp  but if press power button , there s no boot , press caps lock key no light and no dim light on screen, I proceeded to open it to run an inspection and found some corrosion around the backlight IC and when I checked for short there was no short, so I cleaned it with a little brush and little bit of  99% alcohol , reinstall board for test still device is charging normal but no boot  no display n no light on Caps lock, I ran some diode mode reading measurements and found PPVCC_SO_CPU  is 0.00 .\nDoes that mean CPU is dead ?"
