I've confirmed the psu works, i have all the PP12V_ACDC and 3.3v on the PWR_BTN_R, which drops to .5 when power button is pressed. \n\nPP12V_S5_FET_P3V3_S5_P5V_S4 - 12.1\nPP5V_S5 from U7600 is 0. Is this controlled by an enable signal?\n\nAny suggestions on this one. Also, none of the LED lights are on"

            "message": "yeah i believe that would be the most reasonable assumption as these naming are so out of the norm from all other schematics.\n\nAnyway, some how i missed this when i was digging around, the board was missing R8489 and R8496. I found a direct replacement for R8489 but had to use a different rated resistor for R8496 (i used a 68K  1% 1/20w and MF 201 package resistor as i currently didn't have the 5% MF402 1/16W)\n\nReadings after installing resistors:\n\nR8489 - 0.7\nPM_EN_FET_P12V_S5_SSD - 3.4\nPP12V_S5_SSD_FET = PP12V_S5_SSD - 12.1\n\nDiode reading @ R8489 - 0.6\n\nPP12V_S5_FET_PWRCTL to R8496 is 12.1\n\nSo my guess would be U8490? Unfortunately i don't have any donor board that has this part and no one sells them locally. Soonest i can get one is 11/08."
