Don't remember, it's mine.\nAnyway, backlight is working but flex the board and the backlight goes off. I have tried replacing the backlight circuit, running wires all over the shop, poking the board in various places to find the spot, tried pissing about poking the GPU MUX which does turn backlight on and off but no more so than poking around the GPU reg or poking the 6259 or the USB HUB U3700. Fucking board's been poked more times than Louise Fokken. Tried a new LVDS connector and different screen right at the start too. Just can't locate it.\n\nBad via?\nBad ceramic cap?\nBad solder joint?\n\nGuess it could be all or any, but if there is a common cause for this, please let me know."
