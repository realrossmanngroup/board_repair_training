            "message": "MacBook had liquid damage.\nAudio board was damaged as well.\nI manage to turn it on but got some lid/sleep issue.\n\nWhen plug charger it turns on.\nWhen I almost close the lid I see display turns off (so lid sensors works?) but when I open the lid it think lid is still closed (no caps lock LED, blank display etc).\nWhen press and hold power button it shut down so power button is working fine.\n\nI replaced twice Audio board with flex and speaker, tried with another power button as well.\nI know there is another lid sensor on mic flex (mic in system works fine) and is connected to J6750.\n\nSMC_LID_LEFT and SMC_LID_RIGHT got correct diode mode values.\n\nIt wont turn on when press power button, turns on when connect charger.\n\nJ6750 was affected by liquid as well (mic flex has been replaced).\nJ6750/3 (flex not connected) got only 0.011 in diode mode but when system is turned on got correct voltage 1.8V\n\nReplaced U4802 just in case and no luck.\n\nDont have another A2179 to fit the board and test.\n\nAny idea?"
