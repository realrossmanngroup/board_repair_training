Also, I have seen in my own example that HWMonitor and iStats often use different names for the same sensors.\nThis is a good article but there is no strict reference to the schematics.\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://logi.wiki/index.php/Mac_sensors_reference_designators#MacBook_Air_11.22_2013_820-3435[/URL]\nUnfortunately, problem like yours are solved by trial and error, swapping modules like trackpad until problem is solved.\n\nIf you have a good, known working board, you can install HWMonitor and then disconnect the trackpad, start laptop and record what is reported as failed sensors. If this sensor is included, that is how you will know if it is on the trackpad. If not, connect trackpad back and repeat same procedure but this time disconnect webcam cable."

Found the pat on the exact page you mentioned in schematics and went to check that resistor and it was missing!   It was LIO Finstack Temp!   That is Heatpipe 2!\n\nI have been keeping track of HWmonitor sensors and their locations adding to my text file but had nothing for Heatpipe 2.   Now I know!  Very hard problem to figure out.    Thanks again Askaleto and to everyone else who chimed in."
