The machine was listed as dead no power.\nI fixed the logic board 'which had no water damage\" only to discover someone had also changed out the screen. They put a water damaged screen on it.\n\nSo now I have a perfect machine with bright white spots on the side.\nI know it's the reflecting sheets..\n\nI have never rebuilt a screen before but I have access to a unlimited supply of cracked screens for free.\n\n1. Can I get the LCD out without breaking it and move it to a lid with good reflector sheets?\n2. Can I put the screen in a vacuum chamber and get the water to release?\n3. Could I possible soak the removed complete screen in alcohol or distilled water and then put in the vacuum chamber to reduce or remove the damage?\n\nI really don't want to spend $400 on a new assembly. I want to keep it as a tester if needed."
