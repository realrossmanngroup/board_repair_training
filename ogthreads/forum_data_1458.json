            "message": "I fixed WD 820-2850 by jumping wires to replace corroded vias/traces from R7052 to R7050, and replaced R7052.\nU7971 was nicked and J5815 was destroyed with its traces from prior pry damage. Replaced them both. Near them were some corroded components that I replaced.\nQ7055 was corrosion underneath it, removed it and cleaned everything. Not sure if I replaced it, forgot to take note and the laptop sat for some time waiting for a new battery.\nNow the laptop runs almost normally except that it charges extremely slow and discharges quickly, and I felt some heat coming from Q7635, L630.\nTested the line between them and I got 13 OHM resistance to ground. I narrowed this low resistance to PP1V05_S0. Is this normal in any way? Never worked on this line before and have no idea!\nNote: U7971 which I had replaced has nothing to do with it. Removing it doesn't change resistance to ground of PP1V05_S0."

Will test tomorrow the charging and see if it changed after replacing Q7055.\nAnd so the lesson is I don't have to hunt for a short to ground on PP1V05_S0 because it will normally have low resistance? \nIf yes, reminds me of the first time I thought I found shorted caps on the line going under the iPhone CPU."

Heating may have reflowed something although I can't see what?!\nLD was around U9600 and I found what seem to be oxidized pads on the chip, and the image did flicker sometimes so I hope I did not do useless work.\nBefore replacing Q7055 as suggested by apprentiz, I had slow charging and orange light. After replacing \"no charging\" and only green light.\nFirst time I worked on it, via from R7052 to R7050 was corroded and I had to jump. So I poked around and found missing line between Pin 4 of Q7055 and Pin 16 of ISL. Must have failed during last rework. After jumping CHGR_BGATE the laptop is back to charging and orange light, BUT still restarts if I poke next to U9600. Not sure if this is something I need to address?\nI am going to test speed of charging now."
