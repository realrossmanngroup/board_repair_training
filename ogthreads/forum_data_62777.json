CPU vcore is 1.75V\nchecked around the board and no signs of liquid damage or corrosions. so started measuring SPI termination resisters and all measured fine.\nCleaned ME for the BIOS and now i get backlight but no image and activity. thinking might be bad bios, so i flash a clean ME BIOS from badcaps coming from piernov and still get the same thing. the backlight thing is throwing me off, backlight comes on means CPU is good?"
