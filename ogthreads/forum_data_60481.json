No obvious liquid exposure. I removed F7000, injected 2 V at PPBUS_G3H, which heated up the CPU power MOSFET Q7960. I removed Q7960 and localized the short to PPVCCIO_S0G (< 1 \u03a9). I tried injecting 1.2 V at PPVCCIO_S0G, but nothing seems to get warm after a few minutes (10 A power supply). How can I definitively say the CPU is shorted?"
