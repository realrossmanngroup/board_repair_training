I changed it with another from a donor but there was some dimmed and almost black lines on top. I tested his original display on another Macbook and it works perfectly fine, so I thought maybe it was a LCD cable issue. I assembled it back but screen doesn't turn on at all. I tried with the replacement one (with the dimmed spots) and it doesn't turn either.\n\nCurrently it doesn't light up with both of the displays. It has picture on external monitor, so I know it's booting.\n\nAny idea what to look for?\"\n\nYOUR ADVICE:\n\nDo you get 3V3/5V_S0SW_LCD?\nCheck also DP_INT_HPD.\n\nDiode mode to ground at pins 1 & 3 of J8500?\n\nOUR RESULT ON THE TEST:\n\n3V3/5V_S0SW_LCD is NOT present.\nDP_INT_HPD is low level 0V.\nPin 1 is NOT present. Pin 3 is present.\n\nAdditional measurements we did:\n\nVDD Pin 1 is present. Pin 2 EDP_Panel_PWR_EN is NOT present - 0V.\nI've done SMC Reset and NVRAM reset.\nAlso update, it now doesn't even boot on external monitor... Please help. Really important Macbook.\n\nThanks!"
