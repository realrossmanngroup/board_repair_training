MacBook will still stay on and run but battery no longer charging.\nI then have to remove the charger from the mains and count to 20/30 seconds before the charger will work again.\nIf I plug the charger back in the same thing will happen.\nWith battery connected PPBUS is 11.33v (which is wrong) should be 12.56\nIf I disconnect battery PPBUS back to normal.\nThe board must of has some work done on it in the past as it's been run through an ultrasonic ( I can tell)\nCan't see any signs of corrosion although the dc-in port was burnt out when client dropped it off.\n\nHave tried SMC/PRAM resets.
