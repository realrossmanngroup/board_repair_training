            "message": "Hey guys, \n\nworking on 820 00045, No one touch on this board before me and don't have any corrosion! the customer said that he stopped working suddenly! \n\nAll \"G3Hot\" (Always-Present) Rails are present and stable until PP5V_S4. \n\nFrom PP5V_S4 to PP1V05_S0 are pulsing! \n\nFor example PP5V_S4 are pulsing 5V and off - 5v and off! Like to PP1V05_S0 1.1V and off repeatedly! \n\nAlready replace U4700 for a new one and no changes! \n\nAny idea to this one?? already searched on forum but i can't find any problem related to this! \n\nthanks"

I can feel the board warm like a working board! \n\nAlready heat the processor a bit, but don't changes! I think the CPU it's damage! \n\nIt's possible on this mode even with damaged processors to recover the information on internal SSD? \n\nOther question its possible to reprogram the bios on this models with TL866 for example ?"

BIOS can be programmed but it is BGA, so you have to remove it, reball, solder to programmer, remove, reball, and resolder without breaking it...better to use something like Medusa to access the BIOS through JTAG connector."
