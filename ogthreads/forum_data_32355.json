It also makes a ticking noise.\n\nI have put a new ISL on so far and tried a different magsafe board.\n\non PP3V42 i have = 3.481v which i assume is okay...\nPPBUS_G3H is = 12.27v\n\nOn U6900 pin 1 (SMC_BC_ACOK) i get 3.37v then it goes up to 3.4 then back down?\n\nOn Sys_onewire i get the same thing 3.37v then up to 3.4\n\nAny ideas where i can go next?"
