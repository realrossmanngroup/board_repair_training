            "message": "Hi everyone, got an 820-00281-10 on my desk that has no signs of corrosion or liquid damahe and was told it just died one day.\n\nI started out getting 20v on the charger but not drawing anything.\nI then found that I had all S5 rails and S5_PWRGD but no PM_SLP_S5_L. I found that PP3V0_G3H was only running at 2.7V So I replaced U7800 and this restored all my rails down to PM_SLP_S0_L and most of the S0 rails.\n\nAfter plugging in the charger though, the draw ramped up to 2-2.5A and the GPU was getting really hot.\n\nI measured and had 0.9V on PPVCORE_S0_GPU and on PPVCCGT_S0_CPU but no voltage on PPVCCGT_CPU_PH1 or 2.\n\nsuddenly the board stopped pulling 2A and is now pulling 0.20-0.23A but no VCORE on CPU or GPU. Is the CPU dead or is there something I'm missing?\n\nSome measurements from around U7100:\nSDA - 1v\nSCLK - 1v\nALL_SYS_PWRGD - 3.3v\nCPUVR_PGOOD - 3.3v\n\nI have no idea where to go from here. If I replace or reflow U7800 it does the 2-2.5A thing again until it resets.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea of where I can go from here or is the board trash?\n\nThanks."
