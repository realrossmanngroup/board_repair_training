Before  disassembling noticed it would not power on and off consistently with power button without unplugging and plugging back in. After GPU replacement the LED 1 just blinks and when power button is pressed the fans will spin but no chime and light continuously blinks. It also continuously blinks with nothing connected but the power supply.\n\ndoes this indicate 100% the power supply is defective?"
