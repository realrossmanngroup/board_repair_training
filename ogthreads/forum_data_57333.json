I have narrowed it down to it being EDP_BKLT_EN, and EDP_PANEL_PWR.\n\nBoth of those are at 0V.\n\nEDP_PANEL_PWR pulses on start, goes to about 5V for half a second, then to 0V.\n\nEDP_BKLT_EN does not pulse, but is at 0V.\n\nI dont know if this is relevant but SMC LID is always at 3V42V, I dont know if these relate to each other.\n\nEDIT: System does power on and boots, chimes, and shows image"
