I found another bios chip from another 3437 board and put fixed dump and board doesnot power anymore. I tried also backup dump and doesnot power anymore. Carrefuly checked all resistors arround and all is ok. Any idea what could be goes wrong? This board should work with another bios chip, right? I tried one MX and one Winbond chip. Original is Winbond. I checked clock chip as it is near and I have 32K for PCH. All resistors arround compared with another board are on their place. Bios chip has 3V and I have green light. Something meesing with bios could block the SMC?"
