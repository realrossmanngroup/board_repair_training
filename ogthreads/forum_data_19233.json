            "message": "First board repair with a MB air 820-3437 solved thanks to forum threads and Louis videos.\n\nDead unit / no fan spin, however green light in magsafe. Most rails seemed fine however had 2v at PP5V_S5, followed some tips from Duke regarding missing PP5V_S5 from an other topic, discovered my U7501 was blown (Thought to myself \"oh shit my skills aren't ready to replace a chip at that size, atleast not without a microscope\") Took at leap of faith and replaced the damn chip, hoping it would work.\n\nIt didn't...... Oh well it was probably due to my lacking soldering skills. However then i noticed the board getting hot and discovered that the Q7560 Transistor next to it was having a party. Replaced Transistor, crossed my fingers for my skills again aaaand we got a fan spin / working machine.\n\nIt probably doesn't seem much to most of you guys here, but as my first board repair it feels fucking great to finally benefit from viewing and reading about all this and do it yourself with succes. I want to thank Louis and Duke for all the help and guides you provide. \n\nBest Regards\nHolmenlund"
