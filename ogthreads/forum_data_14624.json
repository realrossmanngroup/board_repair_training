            "message": "Hi Louis,  \nI received this Macbook Air from a customer which the customer complained is not coming on.  I opened the back cover of the Macbook Air and the fan was spinning but there was no display.  I went ahead and removed the logic board from the Macbook Air and closely looked it under the microscope.  The following areas were corroded.  R1000, C1280 C1217 ( that complete area was densely corroded ) Going further I even saw a little corrosion on U7201 and also on Q9441.  I decided to ultrasonic clean the logic board which i did, but after the ultrasonic the area where R1000, C11280 and C1217 there contact points on the logic board are exposed where RED marks are visible.  Also I went ahead and checked the power rails where PP3V42_G3H and PPBUS_G3H are present.  I also found that PP3V3_S0 and PP5V_S3 are showing 0 volts.  The green light on the magsafe charger is coming on, but the fan does not spin.  I need your further advice as to how can I go further troubleshooting this Logic Board.  I am trying to refer to some of your videos to see if i can fix this logic board.  Your help in this shall be highly appreciated.  Thanks and Regards,  Raj.."

As a matter of fact I was watching a video that you have uploaded to see how you are fixing the corroded traces.  [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAHLji04zOo&t=665s#t=26.221112206[/url].  Will work on it now and I shall get you my feedback.  Thanks."

I tried to fix the traces on the logic board by checking the continuing but then was not successful.  So I asked the customer if I could change the logic board itself, where I found one for $ 99.00.  I can keep this board as a practice board and move on.  As the customer has agreed for a used  logic board, I am going to replace it with it and keep moving forward.  Thanks and Regards, Raj."
