I'll admit , I am not the best at reading schematics , but am trying to learn so please bear with me lol. \n\nVisual inspection of the board showed corrosion on R7564 and C7564 . After looking futher both traces coming from U7501 to R7564 and C7564 were burnt in 2. Repaired both traces. I have short to ground on both 5v and 3.3v lines so I did remove U7501 to see if it may be the cause of the short but it's still present with it removed. \nBelow are my power rail measurements. \n\nI'm not really sure where to go from here so hoping someone could point me in the right direction. \n\nPPBUS_G3H 8.6v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS 8.6v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS 8.6v\nPPDCIN_G3H_ISOL 16.7v\nPPDCIN_G3H 16.7v\nPP3V42_G3H 3.42v\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.3v\nPP5V_S5 cycles between 3.8-5v with u7501 attached / 1.2v with it removed - no short to ground\nPP5V_S4RS3 0v - short to ground\nPP5V_S0 0v - short to ground\nPP3V3_S5 0v with u7501 attached / .6v with it removed -- short to grd"

Just so I make sure I'm hearing this right , replace both q7520and q7560? If so could you explain what led you to that? I'm trying to get a better understanding of how all this works together .
