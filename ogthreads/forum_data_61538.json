            "message": "820-00928\n\nWill run off charger alone, no battery connected, will run off battery, however when plugged into charger while on battery, it will say \"Battery Is Not Charging\".\n\nI used my USB-C meter, and the board will take 20.38V and 0.000-0.020 mah while plugged into the charger, and having the battery plugged in.\n\nThere was some corrosion around U7000, however Ive replaced what needed to be replaced and still the same issue. Im struggling to find the cause because of my lack of understanding of why this is, and how the charging circuit works.\n\nThank you!"
