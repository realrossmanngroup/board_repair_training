I purchase broken boards on eBay and fix them so this was one of those boards.   I used a utility called LBE to change the board's SN of the replacement board so it matches the machine and clean the security area so there is no bios password on the machine. \n\nI can \"option\" boot to my test drive but the customer's drive is now asking for a pin.  \n\nI guess there is a difference between firmware password and FMI?"

I liked this because my repair time was zero. I thought I just had to go in to the bios and remove the security and flash the new board to the SN of the machine I was putting it into. but. That is not all of it........\n\nYou also have to wipe the NVRAM \"Command-Option-P-R\" !\nOnce the NVRAM was wiped my problem was solved! How interesting..."
