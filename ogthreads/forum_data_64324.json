It has 0.002 on diode reading and 0.4 ohm in resistance to ground.\n\nR7020 = 20V\n\nF7000 = 0V and 0.002 on diode reading. After lifting F7000, PPBUS_G3H remained shorted.\n\nF8400  = 0V and seams to be ok (it has continuity). When removed F8400, the short remainded in PPBUS_G3H, and PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT_F had 0.500 on diode reading)\n\nshould I inject 1V here?\n\nCan you help?"
