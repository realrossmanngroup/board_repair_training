I have cleaned and replaced all of the damaged components in that area such as u6990, r6905, d6905, u6901 plus other caps&resistors.\n\nThe magsafe connector on the logic board had some corrosion on the adapter_sense pin which I assume is the reason why I'm not getting any voltage on adapter sense but even when I inject 3.3v on the ADAPTER_SENSE pin of the magsafe and plug the charger in I still get no green light except for a very dim one. I get 3.4v on pins 1/4&5 of U6900 but still no green light and R6929 measures good.\n\nI have used 2 different known working magsafe boards.\n\nI have 12.6v on PPBUS_G3H and 3.3v on PP3v3_S5 but when I jump the power pads to turn this on nothing turns on.\n\nResistance to ground on Pins 1/4 of Y2810 is around 11.5Megaohms."

            "message": "Update: I ultrasonic'd the board and plugged in the charger afterwards and I got a green light. I jumped the on off pads and the fan spun so I assumed this was working so I put it in the assembly, plugged the cables in then the battery. When I plugged the charger in the light was dim and after a little while I noticed R6905 was sizzling. Under the microscope when I plug the charger in R6905 gets so hot to the point where the solder on the pads melt and if I touch it it will move.\n\nI put another R6905 on the board and again it did the same thing.\nIn diode mode Pins 6&8 of U6990 are 0.004v to ground. PP3v42_g3h is around 0.30v to ground and R6905 is 0.66v to ground.\n\nThe pads on Pins 6/8 of U6990 were gone and I had to run wires under the chip so I'm not sure if that is causing this short and previously Pins 6/8 of U6990 would start smoking a little but for some reason the short went away.\nI replaced C6990 before so I don't think that could be causing the short."
