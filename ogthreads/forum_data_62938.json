Most likely thought it was the GPU after replacing the 3V battery and pram reset.\n\nUsing a replacement tested 820-00292 board, all leds come on, you can hear chime but only backlight appears on internal LCD. External video works fine.\n\nIs it possible the original board with no led#3 coming on also internally damaged the LCD? Customer claims the iMac just randomly died."
