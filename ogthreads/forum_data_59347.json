Located C7081 to be problem, replaced and now PP3V3_G3H shows 2.2v.\n\nRemoved R6923 and pin 1 is 3.42v so that problem is on the board side.\n\nI've checked diode mode the caps around all the CD3215 and they are all 2.2v and 0.33(d) \n\nI've used a thermal camera but obviously as it's not shorted it didn't show anything\n\nAny help in trying to locate the problem."

On pin 1 without the R6923 on I get 3.42v\n\nThe only thing I have noticed is a missing, i think it's a cap, from the Hall sensor block., but this wouldn't make any difference to the drop , I would have thought.\n\nAny thoughts??"

I applied 3.42v to the system side and reduced the amps to see what was the lowest I would get, this was 0.04amps and made me think that at such a low amp it can't be a problem on the system. I then start to measure from R607 and noticed that when I got to D6902 on one side I was getting 5.12v but on the other it was 3.36v and bingo problem found."
