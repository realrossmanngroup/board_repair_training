It's an OEM brand new from Apple 85w charger. Bad SMC?\n\nThanks!"

Said SMC I/0 Fail as the warning.\n\nU5510 has the dot in the top left corner (so that is PIN1, confirmed in BV as well)\nGoes does left side and then upper right is PIN6, goes down to PIN10, which is ground (0V.)\n\nThose are the measurements I got. I can measure again when I get home, but I measured once and then pulled the power and measured again. I did have one discrepancy where only ONCE did PIN 8 show 0.010V. However I tried 5 or 6 times again, even letting the board sit there with the fan on full speed and it wouldn't go low again.\n\napparently I've measured all wrong. or my memory in the AM isn't doing well. Looks like the right side of the chip should be PIN10 top right and going to PIN6 on the bottom.
