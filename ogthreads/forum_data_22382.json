To make sure that wasn't the issue I plugged in a working keyboard that I have and I was able to do a PRAM reset which did not solve this. I don't believe the board was liquid damaged but I haven't taken it apart to see if there was damage to the other side of the board.\nIt chimes on startup but once i login and go to the sound preferences it shows \"Digital Out - Optical Digital-out port\".\nWhen I plug in headphones it switches to heaphones fine and when I unplug it goes back.\nThe headphone jack has been cleaned out but still no help."
