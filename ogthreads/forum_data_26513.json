Right now the magsafe responds to an SMC reset but otherwise it's a brick.\nFound (the hard and painful way) C7620 becomes incredibly hot within seconds after connecting power. I can say I've never felt any component be this hot on a board ever.\n\nCurious what this could be an indication of and if someone has seen this before. Not plugging it back in as I do not want to do any more damage or melt a hole in my desk ;)\n\nAny thoughts?"
