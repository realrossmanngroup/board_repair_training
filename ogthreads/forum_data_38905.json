Green light, fan spins for a moment (few turns) then stops, 3 seconds or so later repeats in an endless loop.\n\nSo far:\nPPBUS_G3H is 12.58v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS is 12.55v\nPPBUS_S5_HS-OTHER_ISNS is 12.58v\nPPDCIN_G3H is 18.50v\nPP3V42_G3H is 3.48v\nPPVRTC_G3H is 3.48v\nPP5V_S5 is 4.92v\nPP5V_SUS is 4.41v\n\nReplaced U7200 and all joints look like a work of art they are that nice. Pin 6 is 0.771v. Pin 1 is 0.00v\n\nAny ideas guys?"

            "message": "Yes, it pulses. For example at L7220 you get a quick burst that is around 3.3, but it is so quick I cannot tell anything without an oscilloscope. If I keep the meter probe on L7220 nothing happens again until I remove the probe.\n\nHistory? None that I have been told. It has unfortunately been worked on before and ultrsonic cleaned before I got it. Frankly, I would rather have it withy all the crap still on as that always gives clues at lest.\n\nIt is effectively trying to start, sensing something wrong and shutting straight off, then sensing it is all fine and looping.\n\nI am going to check Q7221 again tomorrow. I am unwell and can only do som much in a day. From memory, Pin 2 had 4.94v and pin 1 had nothing, but if you check at the right moment you get a spike of 3v or so and if you keep the meter on there it does nothing until released. Same with pin 1 of U7200 as it turns out. My guess is that Q7221 is OK.\n\nNever come across this before. Had plenty that sort of work, don't work, dead etc. But this is irritating although rewardig if solved I am sure."
