I have 8.6V incoming on F7140 but 0V coming out.\nReplaced F7140 and put the board back in the Mac, connected battery and smelt something burning. Upon checking F7140 I had 8.6V going in, 0V coming out. Not sure if it was F7140 that I smelled.\n\nChecked for short to ground on pin 2 of F7140 and got one.\n\nNow I'm injecting power to PPBUS_G3H (on pad 2 of F7140) but nothing gets hot or even warm. Went up to 8V and 2A but nothing.\n\nWhat would the experts recommend I do/check next?"

If it's a shorted mosfet cpu, this means it will let pass 8V to cpu!\n\nIf nothing heats up, maybe internal short or direct metal short connector that will not let you feel any heat. it's rare to blow a ppbus_g3h fuse, because the fuse is rated 24v 8A it means 192 Watts.\nSame as sucking 24A at 8V!

            "message": "Yes it's one method of finding shorts among others.\n\nWhen you put Amps at maximum, let say 5A, it doesn't mean 5A are delivered into the circuit, it means 5A are available for the circuit if it needs it, now you will [U]gradually [/U]increase the voltage 0.5V, 1V, 1.5V and so on until you feel something heating without exceeding the limit of the power rail shown in the schematic.\nWhen you gradually increase the voltage you should see and monitor amps display on the PS, it will increase depending on what the circuit is taking (we don't know how much current it will take so we just set it to max and control the voltage). Usually you don't need to reach the maximum amp to find the short except when nothing heats up and you are desperate and think the short is internal to the board.\n\nIt's just a matter of power Watts=Amps X voltage. For axample, if your shorted component on a 12V power rail start to heat at 3V, 1.5A (3*1.5=4.5Watts) someone else could have the same result with the same shorted component starting to heat with 2.25V and 2A (2.25*2=4.5Watts)\n\nNow for normal operation, if you have a known working device at 12Vdc 0.5A, of course you just set the voltage to 12Vdc and limit the current for good practice to 0.5A but even if you put 5A, if the device is not faulty (shorts) it will not take more than 0.5A.\n\nI really hope I didn't bring more confusion :confused:"
