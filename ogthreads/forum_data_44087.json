            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have a dear old macbook pro A1398 early 2013 with a smashed display.  I bought a replacement screen, attempted to fit it, but i seem to have blown a chip on the motherboard.  I did not disconnect the battery cable and the laptop turned on while i was holding the motherboard!  Consequently, i cannot get the display to work with either displays.  I've watched one of Ross's videos on the same laptop where he repaired the GPU vcore.  I have a multimedia to test what i need to.  Would i need a schematic of the logic board?  Can you help?  Many thanks, look forward to your reply."
