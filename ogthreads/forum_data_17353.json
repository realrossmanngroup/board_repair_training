            "message": "Hi All,\nI am working on a Mac Pro 2013 model that is not posting. I found a single corroded component on the CPU riser card that I believe is the culprit. The problem is, I have no board view, schematic or donor boards available for this machine. The component is in the bottom left vicinity of ISL6367. I know its a long shot but anyone have any ideas ? I'd hate to have to replace this entire board. See attached photo."
