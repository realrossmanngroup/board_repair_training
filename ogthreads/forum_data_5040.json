            "message": "I've got tunnel vision on this repair ....\n\nCustomer plugged in a generic charger, which was bad, into 3 different macbooks, all of them died. Two of them I repaired ... still working on the third. No liquid damage. And no visible board/trace damage. Just the few components visually blown on the top.\n\nFound D6990 and U6990 were blown. R6990 was bad as well as R7005 and U7000. Replaced all of that and a couple of caps, C6991 and C6994 right next to U6990.\n\nPlug it in ... get a green light for about 5 seconds. Then no light, once in a while it comes on for a second or two. U6900 pins 1,4,5 - 2.95v. U6901 - Pins 1,2 - 3.2v .. pin 4 - 3v, pin 5 - 3.42v.\n\nSMC reset is at 3.4v.\n\nQ7030 - Pin 1-3 12.3v .. pin 4 12.7v .. pin 5 18.2v.\n\nFound 18.6v coming in has a voltage drop every 5-6 seconds. Usually 1.5-2 volts on the meter. Which of course causes the 16v to drop as well. Fuses check ok (found one acting like a resistor on one of the other repairs).\n\n\nAt this point, any tips would be helpful. Not exactly a noob to board repairs, but not a veteran either. Just got into mac's as well. Will be back in the shop Thursday, but the above is what I recall at the moment."
