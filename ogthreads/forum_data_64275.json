I replaced about 20 or so capacitors in this area.\nWhen I put everything back together, everything on the board was working, including the keyboard caps lock light. But when I sealed it up all the way, the caps lock light no longer was working, the fans were going at full speed, and I noticed the LCD screen would not come on unless I pressed the power button once, then it would light up for about 1 second, then go black. If I pressed the power button again, it would again light up for 1 second and go black. I troubleshot some more, and whenever I unplugged the keyboard, the screen would stay on longer then 1 second, acting normal. \nI probed the keyboard JT200 pin 5, and only when the keyboard was plugged in did I get what I thought was a short. I have since ordered a new keyboard but with this keyboard I am getting the same thing. \nRT119 Is getting voltage. I don't know where to go from here."

R5216 I did not have the exact resistor, so I replaced it with a 270k even though it calls for a 255K. R5216 I had the exact one 750k. Now I am getting 1.32v from both. R5215 pin 1 I get 5v. I also replaced Q5216, but still no magsafe light is coming on. Looks like the I got to wait on U5200 now to come in. Any other troubleshooting I should try?"

I did replace U5200 too. I am going to attach some images of this pad that is missing, the boardview that I have does not show these two pads, so I have no idea what they are there for. Maybe you may know? I did notice there was some residue around UF800. I tried flowing with flux and no good with this either.\n\nI do have another customers board in here now and their board on C5223 in diode mode is .621, and the  board we are currently working on shows .895. I do see right in the area of pin 10 for U5200, a top part of the board looks like a small top surface layer of the board is missing. I am wondering if it is down far enough to affect this. See the image with the red circle for this."
