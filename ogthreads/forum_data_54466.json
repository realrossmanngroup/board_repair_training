            "message": "Pardon me if i post it here since i can't find an imac section, iMac 820-3302-A works but no backlight\n\nF9700 = 12v pin 1 & 2\nR9712 = 12v pin 1 & 2\nFB9708 = 12v pin 1 & 2\n\nP MOSFET Q9702\n\nPins 1,2,3 = 12v\nPin 4 = 11.75\nPin 5 = 0v\n\nReplaced Q9702 still no backlight pin 5 = 0v\n\nR9721 pin 1 = 12v while pin 2 = 11.75 BKLT_EN_DIV and connected to MOSFET Gate, since this is a P MOSFET is this pin supposed to have lower voltage so MOSFET will let power through Drain?\n\nChanged R9721 still 0v on MOSFET pin 5.\n\nCurrently i am staying away from replacing U9700 since VIN pin 23 power source is from PP12V_S0_BKLT_PWR which i believe generated by Q9702 Drain\n\nAny help will be appreciated."
