Known-good battery. Voltage is going to the board normally, same as a known-good logic board. PPBUS on both boards is at 11.4V with just battery plugged in.\n\nBoard was liquid-damaged. I attached pre-ultrasonic pictures.\n\nI've seen this before but I'm not sure what's happening. Something on the board is telling it not to turn on.\n\nThe 6 pins on the connector are measuring the exact same in diode mode as a known-good board.\n\nAny ideas?"
