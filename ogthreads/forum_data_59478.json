I have checked the pins on Q8150 and are the following:\nVMON_Q4_BASE = 0v759\nS0PGD_BJT_GND_R = 0v087\nALL_SYS_PWRGD = 0v668\nVMON_Q2_BASE = 0v675\nS0PGD_C = 0v128\nVMON_Q3_BASE = 0v675\nI\u2019ve replaced Q8150 and same result\n\nI've also replaced from advice of others: \nY1915\nU1950"

I saw fan spin and got excited, thinking I found my issue. \nI checked all the voltages going to the line, per your suggestion, with a closer eye this time, and noticed that PP1v2_S3 was 1v08 instead of the expected 1v2 (Initially thinking this was in the margin of error). So After checking the resistor R7450 to make sure it was in spec, I decided to change Q7430. Once I did that, I got the 1v2 I was expecting, and board fixed. Thanks again for your help"
