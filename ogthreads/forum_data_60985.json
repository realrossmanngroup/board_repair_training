            "message": "Hello,\n\ncurrently I'm working on a water damaged 820-00850. There was corrosion on and around U7100 with a broken pad No 25. After trying to restore the pad i scratched too much and opened the underlying layer (GND). PP7103 is not shorted to ground but pin 25 of U7100 is now... Any ideas how the fix this the best way? Is it possible to short CPUGT_PWM1 to CPUGT_PWM2?\nThe rest of the board seems to be good. I get ALL_SYS_PWRGOOD and all other rails.\n\nThank you and best regards\nDudiPupan"
