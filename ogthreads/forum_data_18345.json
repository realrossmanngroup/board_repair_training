            "message": "820-3115 No liquid damage,  no previous repair attempt. \nSent to me for \"headphones jack replacement.\" Did not test prior, just replaced it. Got sound with some static from original iPhone headphones jack then sound stopped. Was getting red light on and off. \nResistors, diodes, and caps nearby are within specs. \nRemoved conformal coating from U6880 to see if it lifted from heating, it was not. Then sound from headphones and detection of headphones stopped. \nReplaced audio codec because it is easy, no change\nReplaced jack again, still no sound from headphones and no detection of headphones. \nSound is working properly from speakers.\nBefore I go on and replace shit stupidly (reball from donors U6880 and U6400 audio amp, or other stuff), could they cause this? Could I have bad PCH too?\n\nTIA"
