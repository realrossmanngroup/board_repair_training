            "message": "Hello,\n\nWorking on an 820-2330-A that was easily the dirtiest computer that I've ever worked on.  Airflow from one fan was completely blocked. The computer was brought to me as \"no power\".  Magsafe 85W goes green, so one-wire seems ok but no fan spin.  After extensive cleaning with no apparent corrosion found, I've been troubleshooting.  I jumped the gun on a replacement of C7771 that was reporting 0.321V and after replacement nothing changed.  Don't know why I did that.\n\nIn any event, Q7770 pin 5 (PPBUS_G3H) is 12.57V but then pins 1-5 are all 0.321V.  Q7220 also has 12.57V on pin 5 but then P5VS5_LL (pins 1-3) and P5VS5_DRVH are all 0.00V.  Am I misunderstanding the schematic or should those be present when the board is plugged in?\n\nLooking towards U7201, PP5VS5_ENTRIP is 0.00V and that's where I lose the plot.  Resistance in Ohms of R7200 is 71.5k (specified as 75k).  Q7210 pin 2 P5VS3_EN_L is 3.412V, R7210 resistance is 9.97k (close enough to 10k, I think). \n\nPossible for multiple things to be wrong with the board, so I'm guessing that I'll be in for some work.  Hoping for some suggestions as to what to test next to find the fault source(s) and also thoughts on where I did redundant or unnecessary troubleshooting, besides the obvious unnecessary replacement of C7771.\n\nSteve"

I can't seem to find an exact match for the specs of C7770 (0.1UF 10% 25V X5R spec in a 402 package).  As a general rule, when that happens is it ok to substitute with slightly different specifications such as different voltage rating (higher is ok?) or different tolerance?  I think I'm asking generally, are there certain specs on a capacitor that should never be compromised or are there \"close enough\" values so I don't have to keep searching for an elusive cap?  Same question for resistors too:  If I can't find an exact match for a 4.42K 1% 1/16W 402, which (if any) of the specifications can be compromised?\n\nSteve"
