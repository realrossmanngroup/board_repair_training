            "message": "Hello,\n\nI have a MacBook here that does not want to turn on. On the charger, I can see 0.04 amps for a split second then 0 amps for a few seconds and then it cycles again. No signs of liquid damage. Where do I even begin?\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.6 volts (0.398 resistance to ground when off)\nPPBUS_HS_CPU = 12.6 volts\nPPBUS_HS_GPU = 12.6 volts\nPPBUS_HS_OTH5V = 12.6 volts\nPPBUS_HS_3V3G3H_T = 12.6 volts\nPPBUS_HS_3V3G3HRTC_X = 12.6 volts\n\nPP1V2_S3 = 0 volts \n\nPP1V8_G3S = 1.8 volts\nPP5V_G3S = 5 volts\nPP3V3_G3H_T = 3.3 volts\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC_X = 3.3 volts\nPP3V3_G3S_T = 3.3 volts\nPP3V3_G3H_SSD0_SNS = 3.3 volts\nPPBUS_G3H_SSD0_SNS = 12.6 volts\n\nPP3V3_S5 = 0 volts\nALL_SYS_PWRGD_R = 0 volts\nSMC_RSMRST_L = 0 volts\nCPU_VCCST_PWRGD = 0 volts\nPP1V05_S3 = 0 volts\n\nPP1V8_AWAKE = 1.8 volts\nPP1V8_SLPS2R = 1.8 volts\n\nAny advice?"
