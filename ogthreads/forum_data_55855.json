So I removed f7040 put my power supply on 12v and placed it on pin 2 of f7040 so that should now rule out anything on isl as being an issue am I right? If not.

So when fan spins it at 3.3v when off it goes to zero the only other rail I found that does this is ppv1v5_s3 and gets power from pp3v3_s3 which isn?t pulsing on off it stays stable all the time."
