Apple logo would show for 5 seconds with loading bar, computer restarts, repeats. Green light on charger and fan spin.\n\nWhen everything is disconnected and only the DC in adaptor is plugged in, it is stuck on an S5 state:\nPPBUS_G3H is present\nPP3V42_G3H is present + green light on charger\nPP5V_S5 is present\nP3V3S4_EN 0v\nPP3V3_S5_PWRCTL is present\nPM_SLP_S5_L 0v\nSMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN 0v\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN 3.3v\nPM_BATLOW_L 3.3v\nPM_PWRBTN_L 3.3v\nPM_RSMRST_L 3.0v\nPM_PCH_APWROK 0v\nPM_PCH_PWROK 0v\nPM_PCH_SYS_PWROK 3.3v (normally 0v, but I jumped from PP3V42_G3H_PCHPWRGD)\nPCH_SUSWARN_L 3.3v\nPM_SYSRST_L 0v\n\nHow should I proceed with this?\n\nThank you!"
