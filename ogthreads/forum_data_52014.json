No other signs of any corrosion/junk anywhere else.\n\n[B]Symptoms[/B]\n\nBoard behaves, randomly, in different ways when power is applied.\n\n1) Powers on drawing either 0.180, 0.200, or 0.250 amps, fan spins, fan goes off and it falls back to 0.025, then powers back on with original amperage. The readings below are from this state, as it's the most common occurrence. USB light, but no activity. No caps-lock activity. 80% of the time.\n2) Powers on and sticks at 0.025. 20% of time.\n3) This is the odd one -> Powers on and works completely normally, flashing folder mark, etc, but no backlight. Very rarely, but I've got it to do this twice.\n\n[B]Readings[/B]\n\nPPBUS_G3H: 8.57\nHS_COMP: 8.57\nHS_OTHER: 8.58\nPPDCIN_G3H: 18.15\nPP3V42_G3H: 3.44\nPPVRTC_G3H: 3.31\nPP5V_S5: 5.1\nPP5V_S4RS3: 5.1\nPP5V_S0: 5.0\nPP3V3_S5: 3.31\nPP3V3_S4: 3.31\nPP3V3_SUS: 3.31\nPP3V3_S3: 3.31\nPP3V3_S0: 3.31\nPP3V3_S4SW_SNS: 3.31\nPP1V8_S3: 1.79\nPP1V2_S3: 1.2\nPP1V05_SUS: 1.05\nPP1V5_S0: 1.5\nPP0V6_S0_DDRVTT: 0.6\nPP1V05_S0: 1.05\nPPVCC_S0_CPU: 1.7\nPM_PCH_SYS_PWROK: 3.44\nPLT_RESET_L: 3.3\nRTC_RESET_L: 3.3\nPCH_SRTCRST_L: 3.3\nPCH_INTVRMEN: 3.2\nPCH_DSWVRMEN: 3.2\nPM_DSW_PWRGD: 3.4\nPM_BATLOW_L: 3.3\nPM_RSMSRT_L: 3.29\nPM_PWRBTN_L: 3.4\nPCH_INTRUDER_L: 3.0"
