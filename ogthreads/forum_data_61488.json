            "message": "Hi All,\n\nI am new to board repair but have an education in electronics from college two decades ago. Having lost my job in aviation I'm hoping to make a go of Mac board repair in the UK.\n\nIve had some luck with repairing a couple of MacBooks using Louis\u2019s fantastic videos but the A1706 appears quite a chore to re-assemble just to spot fans spin with ribbon cables hidden by ribbon cables with the fans being left in the case and all.\n\nAfter the liquid spill its owner sent it to sleep and delivered to me within a day [he says].\nWont boot, no display but fans spin, no external display.\nBurnt LVDS ribbon cable adapter to screen (burnt at screen control board too), tried some test screens but waiting on new ribbon cable adaptor before further testing.\n\nSo the fans spin on this one already and this has thrown me. I am lost and need help!\n\nI have attached photos below of all corrosion I have seen on it in the hope for opinions on which must be removed, reflowed or replaced. I gradually purchasing spares of  components replaced in Louis's videos but I have only gained one A1465 donor board so far.\n\nFrom what Ive learned from watching Louis\u2019s videos it appears to reach the S0 state\u2026..\nBut there are a few rails missing (are these supposed to be missing).\nAnyhow Ive embedded a few questions along the way (in brackets). Fanspin doesn't seem to be the reward for this board - what is?\n\n(I will just add my multimeter UNI-T UT139C seems to take a long time to settle down when measuring ppbus_g3h and the like. If I hold the probes on it might well drop half a volt after 40 seconds - not sure whats going on there - my other multimeters behave the same)\n\nppbus_g3h    13.1v\npp3v3_sus    3.3v\npp3v3_s0    3.3v\nppvcc_s0        0.73v (shouldn\u2019t this be 1.5v)\nppvccsa_s0    0.85v (why does pdf say range 0.55 to 1.5v)\nppvccgt_s0    0v\npp1v2_s0    1.2v\npp0v6_s0    0.6v\npp1v8_s0    1.8v\npp1v0_s0sw    1v\npp5v_s0        5.2v\n\nppvccedram_s0_cpu    0v    (40ohm to earth, I expect this is ok????)\nppvccedram_reg_f        0v\npm_opc_zvm_l        0v\ncpu_zvm_l            0v (signal comes from U0500 - what does this chip do?)\n\npp5v_s0_vcore1    5v\npp5v_s0_vcore1    5v\nppvcc_s0_cpu        0.5v    (should this be 1.5v, page 68 of pdf indicates 0.55 - 1.5v Why?)\n                    It seems to wander between 0.43 and 0.53 according to my multimeter.\n\npp5v_s0_fan_conn    5.2v        Does this indicate fan wold be spinning if it was back in case?\nsmc_lid            3.4v     Does this indicate lid(screen) open or closed?\nlcd_bklt_en_l        13v        Is this an ok level?\nbklt_en_r            0v\nedp_bklt_en        0v\n\nall_sys_pwrgd        3.2v        I left mentioning this till last because Im sure it was 0v when I first measured it. But now its there. Hmmmm\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\nRegards, Andy in the UK\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"IMG_3865.jpg\"]60032[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"IMG_3868.jpg\"]60033[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"IMG_3864.jpg\"]60037[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"IMG_3867.jpg\"]60035[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"IMG_3863.jpg\"]60031[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"IMG_3866.jpg\"]60034[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"IMG_3870.jpg\"]60038[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"IMG_3862.jpg\"]60036[/ATTACH]"

I made measurements over multiple days and it does seem to have changed. I am embarrassed how long I have had this board - I tried and tried over 10 days before deciding to join the forum.\n\nForgot to say, my USB volt/ammeter shows  20volts supplied but 0.000 amps drawn.\n\nThanks again :)"

Yes I think for a beginner Ive got a pretty hopeless board.\n\nI have talked customer around into purchasing a refurbed board (at his expense)  but before going down this route he wants confidence in the rest of his computer working first. Its around $500 as it was 3.3GHz and 16GB/512GB\nIf I can keep him happy chances are I get to keep the broken board as a much needed donor.\n\nSo is there any way to get some confidence in the screen without using a working logic board.\ne.g. should the backlight come on with just the right voltage on the supply line and an earth? or does the screen rely on other signals to light the backlight?\n\nI wonder how does the screen supply business test returned screens? Im wondering if there is any cost effective solution to test them other than keeping a stock of working logic boards. Ive collected a bunch of broken screens from customer repairs but from examining pinouts theres big danger in assuming just because a connector fits together they have the same pinout."
