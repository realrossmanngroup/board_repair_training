            "message": "This 820-3332-A works fine until it randomly freezes. If it freezes it still shows a picture but i cant type anything nor move the mouse. Same if i boot from an external drive. Power Button can still turn it off. I already resoldered the joints on U8900 but no change. Can a reflow or new IC help i this case? Or is it a different problem this time? I remeber from one of Louis\u00b4s streams that there also is an issue where the CPU clocks down so far that the device crashes... Could it be that?"

Even if i unplug the battery and wait it wont show anything on the screen. It also wont chime and PRAM reset is also not possible anymore. And i did not touch it...GPU_VCORE is 0.9V."
