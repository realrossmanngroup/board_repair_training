            "message": "I've become pretty comfortable (I though) with this type of issue, but this board is kicking my ass right now. Symptoms and order of attempts:\n\n1. Board had liquid damage that was cleaned at some point in the past, before I got it. Nothing looked too ugly except for one small area near the oft-shorted C6405. I cleaned that area up, and still had a short on 3v42 (.000).\n\n2. Traced short to SMC, replaced and short was gone, but no green light still.\n\n3. Checked ppbus_g3h and it's missing (.7v) but has no short.\n\n4. pp3v42_g3h missing. SMC_BC_ACOK is 0v at U7000.\n\n5. This led me to check voltages at U7000; pins 2 and 3 are both present, but pins 23 (chgr_phase) and 14 are zero. Resistance at pins 17/18 and 27/28 is normal (2.0ohm, 20.0ohm)\n\n6. I replaced U7000 again, along with Q7080, Q7085, Q7030, Q7035 and Q7055 just to be safe. I know liquid was in the area, and didn't want to waste time. However...\n\n7. Same results; missing ppbus_g3h (.7v) and pp3v42 (0v)\n\n8. ppbus_g3h is present at 12v with battery installed (a bit low), and 3v42 is still missing but does jump up to .4v on battery (compared to 0v on charger).\n\n9. PPDCIN_G3h present and steady at 16.6v @ R6990. R6990 and R6905 both measure fine, and voltage is missing completely on R6905.\n\nSo I was leaning towards the SMC again, but power isn't even getting to the SMC yet. I've found no shorts on ppdcin_g3h or anything else. I'm not entirely sure where to go from here; I'd suspect the ISL again since my dcin and acin are both present (pins 2 and 3), but still no ppbus voltage. Rather than waste MORE time here, I thought I'd post about it! :)\n\nHelp me out, Aprendiz/Duke! Thank you in advance."

            "message": "Ahh, got this one right after I posted (as usual); taking the blame on this one--shit soldering on U6990 when I pulled/replaced it tracking the 3v42 short. I was too cautious with it being right by the RAM slot, and didn't re-flow it well enough. Got it sitting proper and now all is well--my mistake completely.\n\nFeel free to close this one, thanks!"
