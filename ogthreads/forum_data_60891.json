            "message": "Liquid damage with slight corrosion around U2890, U3500, Q7660. So slight that I thought brushing it off with alcohol would be enough to bring it back to life. Rest of the board looks mint. \n\nNo traces or pads corroded but I did replaced U2890, U3500, Q7660, Q7680 asa precaution with no change. \n\nTaking 20V @ 0A. Cant see any shorts around U7650.\n\nU7650 voltages are as follows:\n\nPin 1: 0V\nPin 2 (PP5V_S4): 0V\nPin 3: 0V\nPin 4 (P5VS4_EN): 0V\nPin 12 (P5VXX_EN): 0V\nPin 20 (S5_PWRGD): 0V\nPin 21 (P3V3S5_EN): 0V \nPin 29 (P5V5_S5): 0V\n\nDiode mode and resistance to ground:\nL7670: 0.407V 900 \u03a9\nL7690: 0.353V 780 \u03a9 \n\nDiode mode at 5V_S5 is 0.410V\n\nPP3V1_RTC: 3.1V\nPP3V3_LDO3V: 3.3V\nPP1V25_VREF: 1.23V\nPMIC_SHUTDOWN_L: 0V\nSMC_ONOFF_L: 3.4V\n\nOn this board, R7828 is the one present and reads 100k\u03a9 \n\nPMIC issue??? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance"
