            "message": "Hi i have an issue with A1706 13\" 2016 Mac Pro. When installing Os it get to a point where it says \"A critical software update is required for your mac, but an error was encountered\" it just goes back to that. The touchbar doesnt seem to be working. I have inspected the board but cannot see any sign of spillage. It only works when internal video cable is removed then it boots into Os with touchbar working and video external\nWould the screen/webcam be the issue or cable?"
