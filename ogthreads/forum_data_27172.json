I replaced the keyboard (after shorting R5115 it turned on) and cleaned the board to be sure i did not miss any water. Now it works except the power button. The button turns the machine just some rare times on but mostly it has no function... SMC_ONOFF_L jumps from 3.42V to 3.25V when i press the power button. I am not sure whats the issue except its the SMC again..."
