            "message": "I got in a Lenovo Z50-70. It has no video either via HDMI or the laptop display. It comes on with a power light and keyboard backlight. The fan spins only a second at power on and then runs continuously later. I'm not seeing any evidence of liquid damage on the board. I've found a schematic for the board, and it is silk screened. What sort of thing do I want to look for in the schematic relating to no video? I figure there must be some overlap with the Macbook because it's also a Haswell system. Thanks.\n\n[url]https://www.flickr.com/photos/135232461@N04/27118833884/in/datetaken-public/[/url]\n[url]https://www.flickr.com/photos/135232461@N04/27118844954/in/datetaken-public/[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.s-manuals.com/pdf/motherboard/compal/compal_nm-a272_r1.0_schematics.pdf[/url]"

I figure if I'm booting up and sitting on the password screen, mashing keys and hitting enter should eventually play the \"idiot sound\" *thunk* thing. I don't get any of that, though it does read any drive you attach to boot from. I wanted to try Knoppix because that plays a ton of loud sounds on bootup, but I think I'm either having trouble hitting enter at the right time or there's an issue with the BIOS being on UEFI only boot mode because the CD reading eventually stops and i don't get the sounds. I'll have to try Knoppix 7.6.0 once I get a hold of a DVD-R. Should be more UEFI friendly."
