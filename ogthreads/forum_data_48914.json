            "message": "Hi guys I had a mac that kept rebooting and no backlight. Corrosion SMC_Reset_L circuit and backlight circuit. Changed all and backlight works. However, the backlight only turns on if the Mac is about 50% pass booting. If i use Option command the backlight is off, when using Command + R its off and I can see apple logo, after it turns on and boots fine into the menu. I have our own Mac in the office and it behaves the same leading me to think its a software/firmware issue, it only happened after we updated it. Customer is freaking out though and keeps saying I have to fix it :), ideas?"
