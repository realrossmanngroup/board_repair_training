            "message": "Hi, I'm currently working on an 820-00840, I bought the device myself with water damage, so please don't be too hard on me if I have done something wrong up to this point, I mainlywanne study this repair matter to get into this\nI would also like to apologize in advance for my bad English.\n\nThe seller said an apple repair shop said the device was water damaged but after I opened the device I don't noticed any corrosion or red indicators\n\nAt the beginning I only got 5V from the charger after swapping U3200 and U3100, the device ran again and I was able to boot everything wonderfully in IOS after I took both chips off the board to use it for another board for testing I must have created a short circuit when soldering it again I definitely only got 5V from the charger after I got 2 new chips and then soldered them to the board U3200 burnt out with a hole And this is where the fun begins. After swapping both chips again, I finally got 20V from the charger  But no S5 Rails I traced this problem back to the U7800 chip which did not output a PMIC_PGD signal after swapping U7800 the voltages match and I get PP3V_S0 and PP5V_S0 but no boot, the fan turns when I connect it after some back and forth I noticed that PPVCCGT_S0G_PH1 / 2/3 was missing What I was able to trace back to a missing GTVR_FCCM from U7100.\n\nU7100 gets 0V on pin2 (CPUVR_VCC) I was able to fix this after I replaced R7192 and then the board drew about 500mA and U7100 got very hot I think I had a short circuit on Pin2 but I'm not quite sure after swapping the U7100 but this was fixed GTVR_FCCM is now 1.6V\nNow I notice that U3200 and U3100 are getting very hot and Q3200 and Q3100 are mine even after I have noticed Resistance to ground of PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS only at 40Ohm (Black probe on ground) I exchanged D3400 now the resistance is 1. 1K Ohm, however, U3200 U3200 are still very hot but get 20V and round about 300mA from the charger now I'm standing on the hose and could use some help Thanks in advance I'm looking forward to learning something new"
