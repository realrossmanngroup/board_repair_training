            "message": "Hi, so this board came in with board looking clean, customer say this died suddenly, when charger plugged in, I got 20v on dc-in, pp3v3_g3h is present..., and then i see that ppbus is shorted to ground with resistance to ground 0.3 ohm.., I have checked resistance to ground on all big coil\nL7410/20/30 = 2.4 ohm\nL7210/20 : 4.4 ohm\nL7370 : 6.3 ohm\nl8060 : 2 ohm\nl7900 : 3.9 ohm..\nis there any more big coil ? I assume the high side mosfet is not shorted, so all left is caps or cpu ? can I inject voltage to ppbus now ?"
