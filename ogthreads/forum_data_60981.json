            "message": "This board was 5V 0A with PPBUS_G3H missing and full shorted to ground. No liquid at all.\nTraced back the short to U9080 TPS62180 ssd's regulator, it was visually totally blown.\nOnce I removed the short on PPBUS_G3H I noticed both SDD nands U8600 and U8700 were totally shorted (very hot):\nPP2V5_NAND_SSD0 shorted\nR9015 shorted on both sides PPVCCQ_ANI_SSD0 and PP1V8_I0_SSD0\nPPBUS_G3H hit probably U8600 and U8700 SDD nands.\nI removed them for fun and short went out with board stuck now at 19V 0A, I think the board complains without the nands.\n\nOut of curiosity, are SSD nands  replacable on these model if I had ones coming from same board? Or is there some magic mariage  between the nands, T2, CPU, bios?\nIs there a way to use the board without nands let say for testing purposes with external usb? There is a P2V5 PGOOD signal from U9080 or T2 will stool the missing nands?"
