            "message": "A Macbook Air (A1466) came in with water damage that had been cleaned and booted fine with working touchpad and battery, but C7114 and battery connector were replaced because of accidental breakage (while no power). Turning it on, the battery indicator had an X, cursor showed up but touchpad didn't work, and area on palmrest above touchpad got extremely hot so we turned it off immediately. This one clearly had a disastrous execution but seems saveable."

            "message": "[MEDIA=imgur]a/hhbxaxO[/MEDIA]\n\nLooks like there is no damage, but there is some gunk (likely just flux) in the connector. As for your second question, to answer the opposite: the touchpad doesn't work when the battery isn't connected and the heat is NOT there. It was when the battery was plugged in that it wasn't recognized an the area about between the spacebar and top of the touchpad got searing hot. Is it safe to plug in the battery to test that part?"
