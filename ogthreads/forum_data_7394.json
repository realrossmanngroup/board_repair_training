I let the iMac run Heaven 3D benchmark for about two hours before the iMac just cut off. Started the iMac again and started the benchmark again and it lasted for about 10 minutes before cutting off again. After that the iMac would not start at all. Tried it again the next day and I could run the benchmark again for almost two hours before it cut off and would not start at all again.\n\nI have now taken a visual inspection of the power supply, but it seems fine, all caps look okey.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with these, should I address the PSU or Logic board?\n\nIt never shows any signs of graphics artifacts."

I would mostly start up run for a while and then seem dead for a couple of hours or until the next day and then start again. I was fairly gentle when warming the GPU, so I don't think i killed it (or killed it more than it already was). I think the logic board has a problem that keeps it from starting, maybe a bad cap or something.\nI have also realized that working on iMacs are very time and space consuming :).\n\nI may take the logic board out again tomorrow if get the time, but it is more hassle to work on this board than  MacBook boards."
