            "message": "Any help with this board would be appreciated.\n\nno history to help.  the board was clean; no evidence of corrosion nor any tarnished test points.  \n\nall g3h rails are present and correct.  Good 32.7kHz pulse coming from pin 12 of the RTC (replaced RTC in any case as I was seeing a pulsed voltage - gunk on the leads in the end).\n\nAll s5 rails are there. \n\nPM_SLP_S4_L is not present.  Ditto PM_SLP_S5_L.  not seeing anything change when the SMC_ONOFF_L is shorted.\n\nI've reflowed the SMC and checked all the SPI resistors and traces.  \n\nis this probably a dead PCH/CPU?\n\nOne thing to note is that the resistance to ground on L7520 (PP5S4RS3) is very low when the IO board is plugged in.  With one IO board it was less than 1Ohm, on another I tried it was 20Ohm.  When unplugged the resistance is OL. I don't have any other IO boards for this model to test against but this does seem odd.  Nothing getting hot though.  Current draw is only 0.02A at 14.5v.\n\nthanks\nJustin"
