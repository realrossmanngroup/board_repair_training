            "message": "Hi All,\n\nQuite a few names on here i already recognise from AR & CM forums. \n\nAnyway, I have a slightly different issue with this iMac 27\" 2011. It came in with the usual GPU issue. This is no problem, as we ordered a NEW GPU card from Apple.\nThis all went fine, card replaced imac working fine, no issues at all, passed VST, AST ASD etc etc.\n\nNext day just before calling customer, we tried it again. NO IMAGE/BACKLIGHT this time. \nOn further inspection, LED 3 is not illuminated. I assume we have been shipped a duff card from Apple. Not the first time, but quite rare.\nWe try 2 more new cards, and none of these work. All these cards are fine, so it must be a logic board issue.\n\nOther than the logic board supplying PP5V_S0, PP3V3_S0 & PP12V_S0, what else should i be looking out for ?\n\nThanks"

No idea who has real new ones at the moment. Send some messages to the big sellers on Ebay like SEE and E-Best. All the shit on Aliexpress that was listed as new were reballed that I got.\n\nDo you have experience in BGA rework, these are huge chips and are quite a challenge to solder correctly. Also you need to flash the ROM."

I actually found 216-0811000 in Europe at a decent price...\n\nI must confess that my experience on BGA rework  is not amazing but I managed to get my hands on a ZM-R6200 at a very cheap price. I assume it will help a lot. But any advice would be greatly appreciated...\nI remember that in a video on Louis youtube channel, it was said that the original heating programs were not the best and they needed some change. Do you know anything about this ? (I'm thinking now that I should create a new post for this as it could be quite useful to many people)"
