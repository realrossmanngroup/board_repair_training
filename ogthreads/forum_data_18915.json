Not a popped cap.\n\nPPBUS_G3H 8.6V\n\nFirst noticed S5 rails were 0.5V.\nChecked EN 3v3 and 5V S5 all fine.\nTried Q7520 and Q7560 and U7501 That's when I notice PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISN is shorted to ground. No visible signs of bad caps.\nPlugged it up to PSU 8V @3A and nothing is burning my finger. No caps, nothing.\n\nIdeas please?"
