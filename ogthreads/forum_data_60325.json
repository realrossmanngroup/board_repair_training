            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have that board that was liquid damaged.\nI have already replaced U7370 as it was shorting PPBUS_G3H to PPVCCSA_S0_CPU.\nThe chip is an SIC532 but showing up as SIC535CD on the 820-01041 schematics (pretty close to the 820-01418)\n\nBoard was then working fine. I could use it for a day or so.\nThen again, same short, same dead IC.\n\nAfter replacing it again, board would work again.\nI did replace that chip 3 times already (and it's no fun cause it seats between CPU and GPU)\nSo my question is: what can cause that IC to die over and over again?\n\nCould it be the CPU draining to much amperage?"
