I have tried injecting voltage of 5v at the pin 3, and Q7520 appears to get hot from the thermal camera, but I have swapped this out now 3 times from donor boards. I cannot imagine all 3 (Q7520's) were bad. Is there something I am missing here?"

I am not finding a short at all, just that voltage drop on the 3rd pin for j7000\n1.9mv @ c1206 3v3_SUS with magsafe plugged in. J7000, pins 1 and 2 with magsafe plugged in is 14.97v. \nWhen you say \"Post diode mode to ground at L7520; w/ and w/o J7000 connected.\" Are you telling me to remove the remove the mini board? I had purchased a new mini board because the prior one I did have, did indeed have a short. When I replaced the mini board, the short went away. \nL7520 is .454v in diode mode with mini board disconnected from J7000, then with the mini board plugged in to J7000 it reads .449v in diode mode (magsafe not plugged in).\n3.405v with PP3V42_G3H @ U1900 pin 13.\n8.57v with magsafe plugged in to R3080 pin 1 for PPBUS_G3H.\n.423v @ C3540 pin 1 for PP3V3_S5 with magsafe plugged in."
