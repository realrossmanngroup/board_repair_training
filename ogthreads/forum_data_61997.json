            "message": "so i've got an 820-00165 in which had no power - I located a short on PPBUS_G3H and blown F7140. Located the short down to a shorted out cap and replaced, also replaced F7140 after confirming there was no further short.\nBoard powers up enters S0 state has fan spin but CPU VCORE is missing also ALL_SYS_PWR_GOOD is missing. Checked PP3V3_S0 and i'm only getting 0.65V there instead of 3.3v. PP3V3_S3, PP3V3_S4 and PP3V3_S5 are all 3.3v as expected. No short on PP3V3_S0 - it's reading 2.5kohm to ground.\n\nI've replaced U1950 just to rule that out but no difference\n\n\nNo liquid board is very clean i'm a bit stumped as to where to go with this one - clearly the low voltage on PP3V3_S0 will prevent VCore from being turned on but I cannot see anything visible on the board which would cause this issue. - the resistance on L7410/L7420 to ground is 30ohms so looks like the CPU is ok."

            "message": "Thanks once again - nailed the issue in one. Checked U8030 had 3.3V on the input side ok, looked then carefully at U8030 under the scope and saw a tiny crack on one edge of it. Pulled a replacement from a scrap 820-3437 and system works perfectly now, starts up, chimes boots only other issue is the battery wouldn't charge or run off the battery even though it was showing 70% charge. Tried a known good battery which works fine so I don't know what is going on there. Best guess i've got is the macbook was dropped - the original cap with the short was cracked as was U8030 so maybe something broken inside the battery. \n\nOne interesting observation i've made on this 820-00165 - U8030 was not covered with hot glue like it is on 820-3437 - therefore easily liable to damage! I'm not sure if that is supposed to be that way and i'll make a note to check the next time an 820-00165 comes in if this IC is covered or not."
