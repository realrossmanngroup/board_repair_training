            "message": "Hi guys, I have an 820-00239, customer said it stopped working after an update. Since this is not a T2 chip version I dont think its a software issue. The machine takes no charge 5.12v, no amp on all ports. I measure as follows:\n\nPP20V on C3201: 5V\nPP3V3_UPC on C3208: 3.3v \nPP3V3_G3H on C3200: 0v (no short)\nPPBUS: 0.014v (no short)\n\nNext I checked U6903\nL6900: 0V (no short)\nPPVIN C6906: 1.33 (no short)\nEnable signal: 2.22v (Assume this means U7000 is OK?)\n\nNext I checked U7000:\nall resistor measure OK and looks very clean\nI have tried to replace it, as a lucky shot but all values remain the same as above.\n\nI cannot find any short on all big coils as well. Suggestions as what to check next, or if I forgot something in my work flow above?"
