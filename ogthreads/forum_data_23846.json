            "message": "This board was liquid damaged in many places including the SMC.\nHere are a list of the components I replaced:\nU5110 - C5120\nRemoved JTAG (J6100)\nU7090 - L7095 - C7098/99\nR5501/2 - Q5500/10 - R5511/12\nU1950 + C1950\nC5020 & R5100 (Around SMC)\n\nI am getting 16.6V on PPDCIN_G3H and into the U7090 chip. There was a short on Pin 2 of L7095(PP3V42_G3H) and I tracked it down to the U5110 so I replaced it and the short was gone.\nFor some reason though when I measure PP3V42_G3H I only get around 0.9v but as soon as I touch Pin 1 of L7095 PP3V42_G3H goes to around 4.6v. When I initially plug the charger in Pin 1 of L7095 usually shows voltage anywhere from 4.3v to 4.6v and one time it showed 3.1v.\nPin 1 of L7095 is almost always around 4v when I measure after plugging in the charger. Pin 2 of L7095 usually fluctuates around 0.91v to 1v when I initially measure but as soon as I touch Pin 1 and measure again it jumps to around 4v. I have never seen this issue where Pin 2 is a certain voltage and it changes once Pin 1 is touched.\n\nI get 0v on SMC_RESET_L and I figure that is because PP3V42_G3H is not a steady 3.42v. Could it be that the U7090 chip I replaced with is bad as well?\n\nDiode mode of L7095 - 0.35v\nDiode mode of SMC_RESET_L - 0.47v"

I unplugged the charger and plugged it back in and now there is no light when I plug the charger in.\nThe voltages are the same as above except Pin 7 is 0.6-0.8v and Pin 3 is 0v."
