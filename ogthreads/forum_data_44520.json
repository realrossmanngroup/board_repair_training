            "message": "Anyone have any suggestion. Have a MacBook Air 13 820-3209 that's not seeing the battery. I've tried a known good battery from another unit with the same result.\n\nOnly issue i'm seeing so far is the SMBUS_BATT_SCL which reads about 2.84v (3.4v on a good logic board) while SMBUS_BATT_SDA reads about 3.4v.\n\nIve replace U7000 and checked R5281 (which reads 3.4v on pin 1 and 2.84 on pin 2). The only thing i haven't done is pulled the smc. Just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything else i need to check or could be the issue. \n\nAnd yes, there was corrosion on the board, which i ran through ultrasonic clean (took images of all corrosion before cleaning)."
