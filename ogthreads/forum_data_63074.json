After the device is turned on, I plug the battery flex, sometimes it draws 0.60 and sometimes 1.98 Amps. It says Battery is not charging. I ordered a new battery and will try it when it arrives. If the battery is faulty, can it cause the problem of not seeing the ssd? How can I be sure until the battery arrives? Is the problem in the battery or the motherboard?\nNote: The original charger is broken.
