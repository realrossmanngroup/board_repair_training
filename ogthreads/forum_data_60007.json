After using dosdude gmux I still had no backlight replaced lp8550 and fuse\n:( now the board is dead again I removed lp8550 and I have the\nSame short on L7720 and u7720\nI didn\u2019t apply a lot of heat and was in and out quickly. What would give me the same short again? I\u2019ve tested around u7880 and it\u2019s not shorted also GPU isn\u2019t in direct short. P.S. Board was running for most of the day and at J5650 pin 1 PP5v_S0 (fan connector) I have 5v but no fan spin :/ I also replace Q5502, Q5501 because they were missing"
