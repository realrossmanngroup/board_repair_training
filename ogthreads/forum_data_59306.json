            "message": "Hi, I have this 820-3332 and it wasn't showing video but it was turning on because the customer used it via Teamviewer. Anyway I opened it and it was dirty as hell... began to read about this motherboard and found that I should change the solder on U8900. Did that, turned it on, and that generated a short on SYSTEM SIDE. I\u00b4ve been looking to find the short, and found that L7630 has continuity to ground. What is the best way to find the short using the multimeter? when I connected it to my PSU it used .280 ma. Thanks for your help!"

            "message": "First I did change the solder on the U8900, turned it on, but still had no image. Then it just turned off and I started seeing .280 aha at the PSU. I removed the F7040 and F7041 to see where the short was... I thought maybe by removing the U8900 the short might go away, but still there...\nI removed the short on PPBUS_G3H, but the short on L7630 is still there, after checking various componentes, I decided to remove C1682 and C1683, the short is still there on PIN 1 of each. Does that means that the CPU is on short? Did I did something wrong to make it short? I never injected voltage I just did the solder change on U8900 then, turn it on, and then it went on short...
