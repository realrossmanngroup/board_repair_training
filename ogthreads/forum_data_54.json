I fixed the backlight and now it works fine but i found out that the fan is always high and it is really slow. It lags a lot... I tested it with ASD and found out these problems but can\u00b4t really figure out what are these in schematic.

            "message": "The way that ASD test works is it loads the CPU, unloads it, and then checks how long it takes for temperature to drop, and how quickly/slowly it rises. Seeing as all these machines use the same heatsink, same fan, same case, when you load the CPU to 100% and then back to 0%, the temperature should increase/decrease at a specific curve. If it So you have a few options here.\n\n1) Heatpipe inside the heatsink is bad - so it is not conducting properly.\n2) Shitty thermal paste/no thermal paste.\n3) Fan isn't in there or able to spin at top speed.\n4) You're SOL.\n\nThe practical real world cause of this is that the heatsink was dropped during reassembly/disassembly from the person who was originally fucking with it, which broke the heatpipe inside the heatsink. Scared, the guy bends the heatsink back into place, and it looks great... right? No, the heatpipe inside is broken!\n\nI'd also check the EFI version of ASD as it is more descriptive with sensors. Check the hardware profile, go to the list of sensors, and read through the list to see which one looks funny. Sometimes you find things that don't show up in the test."

Yes the heatpipe is good and i did not replace the old thermal so i will do it when I'm at home. I'm just wondering why it lags so much, when i don't touch the mouse and suddenly want to use it, it takes time to show me that the mouse did even move?\n\nWell i will check those 4 options and tell you what happened. I don't understand what you meant by that SOL? Im from Finland so i don't understand everything (I found out, Shit outta luck) :D  But thanks! \n\nAnd by the way this forum is really great idea!"
