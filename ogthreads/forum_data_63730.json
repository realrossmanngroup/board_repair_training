I unplug power cord, try couple of times then it will boot again, crash and work... It's never the same scenario....\n\nI've unplugged camera, I've replace power supply, I did SMC reset, I've removed CR2032... still the same. Sometimes it works, sometime it doesnt. \nIf I unlugged HDD, try another SDD, try without HDD/SSD, same... sometimes it will start when I press button, sometimes not.\n\nMacOS 12.6.2\nRadeon Pro 570 4GO\nIntel Core i5 3,4 GHZ\nRAM - 64GB 2400MHz DDR4\n\n\nThanks\nSam"
