The owner said they spilled something on the keyboard and it stopped working.I opened the bottom and noticed a burn mark next to the LCD connector. L8300 had melted, sticking itself to the board and destroying part of the trace under it. The computer has no image and seems like it is power cycling. The fans will spin some what fast, then slow down, then back up. Is that an in indication of power cycling? the G3H rails are present but that is as far as I got."
