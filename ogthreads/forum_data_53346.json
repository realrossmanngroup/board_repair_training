            "message": "Hi Im working on a Macbook air A1466 which was water damaged and was dead with no led on charger.\nI currently have it powering up fan spin. All major voltage are present.\nI have no chime or screen and am not sure of usb activity but usb mouse red led flickers at the start of power up.\n\nCurrently I have no EDP_BKLT_EN and no output from Q77706. U7701 has power on pins C4/D1/C1 but no output .\nThe unit draws about 350ma.\nL7701 ha no voltage on it due to Q7706 not passing voltage pins 3 and 4 have 8v.\n\ni have flashed the bios with a file from the forum but still the same.\nAny help welcomed"
