            "message": "Hi, I'm fairly new to logic board repair and schematic reading / electronics although I have been in the IT repair business for the last 20 years.\n\nI'm trying to work out my first logic board repair and may well have got confused along the troubleshooting route. Could do with a helping hand!\n\nThese are my test results / notes:\n\nPPDCIN_G3H = 14.8v SCHEMATIC SAYS 18.5v ??\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.35v SCHEMATIC SAYS 8.4V\n\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.29v SCHEMATIC SAYS 3.42v\n\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.2v SCHEMATIC SAYS 3.3v\n\nPP3V3_S3 = -- SCHEMATIC SAYS 3.3v\n\nPP5V_S3 = -- SCHEMATIC SAYS 5v\n\nR7910 Pin1 = 3.26v Pin2 = 3.11v 47k ohm tested ok\nC7911 Pin1 = 3.29v Pin2 = 3.17v\nC7910 Pin1 = 3.1v Pin2 = 0v\nQ7903 Pin1 = 0v Pin2=G Pin3 = 3.25v\nQ7910 Pin 4 = 3.29v Pin 3 = 3.11v Pin1,2,5,6 = 0v\n\nThere is no obvious water damage to the board and everything looks great and very clean.\n\nAm I right in thinking the next step is to replace Q7910?\n\nOf course, I could be mis-reading the schematic entirely and have the completely wrong end of the stick...\n\nCheers\n\nStewart"

This leads me on to another problem but I will troubleshoot first before posting again.\n\nI'm still not completely clear on where my logic failed. Everything looked like PP3V3_S3 should have turned on with the values I was testing? An explanation on where I went wrong on this would help me greatly."

I will have to wait to test it once I get the rest of the machine sorted, also waiting for some donor boards to replace a couple of caps.\n\nAm I right in thinking that my logic was nearly correct? The voltage at the gate was only slightly lower than the source but it was looking for 0v aka P3V3S3_EN_L so it could open? From my tests this seems the case.\n\nAlso is this expected / normal? PPDCIN_G3H = 14.8v SCHEMATIC SAYS 18.5v"
