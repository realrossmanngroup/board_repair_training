            "message": "Not the first time I've had this symptom on 820-3437 ( testing with 85W genuine MS2 ). To date I think I have 3 boards in the \"unsolved\" box all exhibiting this.\n\nInstead of the fan doing the on/off/on/off... on-and-run sequence, the behaviour instead is to run the fan continuously for the about the same period as the normal on/off/on/off, and there is only a very -slight- change in RPM when it would normally turn off during the first \"off\" period.\n\nUSB stick will flash *once* when the final on-run state is started, nothing more.\n\nFrom what I can ascertain, all rails are present, platform reset is present, CPU is at 1.7V\n\nI've tried with a known working BIOS, and even gone and replaced SMCs just to see.\n\nAnyone encountered this failure mode before and found a cause?"
