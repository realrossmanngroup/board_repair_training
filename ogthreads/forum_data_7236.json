If you look in the operating system in about this mac, you can see if the OS sees a 60w or an 85w charger.\n\nIf SMC_ADAPTER_EN is not 3.3v, either you have an SMC related problem or you are using a fake charger.\n\nJust buy an original charger. You paid for a rework setup, you paid to set up your business, spend the $50 or so to get a charger that you can trust for testing."
