            "message": "Hi All,\n\nJust wanted to see if I can get some assistance on a A1502 820-4924A I'm working on. Charger I'm using is a 85W magsafe 2 (straight from the wall not through a bench PSU) bought and used on two 3437s I was trying to fix so that should not be the issue.\n\nBoard looks spotless zero signs of liquid damage or corrosion, or even blown components (besides C7380 was cracked but not shorted rail was still present).\n\nBelow are the rails I've checked:\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.43V\nPPBUS_G3H 12.57\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING = 12.25V\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3.3V\nPP5V_S5 = 5V\nSMC_BC_ACOK = 3.39V\n\nEverything looked normal until I got to: \nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER5V = 12.56v. Schematic says it should be 8.6v.\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER3V3 = Same as PPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER5V.\n\nI then checked: \nPM_SLP_S5_Lcompletely 0 no pulse\nPM_SLP_S4_L ditto\nS4_PWR_EN = 0V\n\nIs PM_SLP_S5_L used in the A1502? I read a article while researching why it would be missing that most macbooks do not use this rail hence it's disappearance is usually a non issue. That said I did find another post on here where they were also missing S5_l/S4_L & were requested to note the below rails: \n\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN = 3.4V\nPM_BATLOW_L = 0V\nS5_PWRGD =  3.35V\nPCH_SRTCRST_L = 3.3V\nPCH_INTVRMEN = 3.24V \nPM_RSMRST_L = 3.3v\nPM_SLP_SUS_L = 3.3V\nPCH_DSWVRMEN = 2.96V\nPM_DSW_PWRGD 3.43V\n\nThey were also asked if they trigger SMC_ONOFF_L  if  PM_PWRBTN_L changes. \nPM_PWRBTN_L 3.42 on normal state 0V after shorting SMC_ONOFF_L. I also checked if PM_SLP_S4/S5_L pulse when first connecting the magsafe with SMC_ONOFF_L triggered and it did not both stayed at 0V.\n\nIs there a way to check if the SMC is OK? I'm starting to suspect the SMC but unfortunately I do not have any replacements. and no A1502 donor boards. Are the 3437 or 00165 SMCs compatible?\n\nThanks for your assistance."

I only have that battery and the battery from the 1598. Both are probably stone flat though."

            "message": "Yup genuine magsafe 2 85W charger. I don't buy counterfeit chargers after seeing what it did to a customers Bose QC30s. Fake Chinese chargers melted the micro USB port and the plastic around the port. DC in board is a bit iffy though, waiting for my replacements to arrive so I have not tried another yet. I also do not have the cross flex/io board installed just magsafe. \n\nPM-BATLOW_L is created by the PCH isn't it? \n\nThink that's because I checked PPBus first before doing anything else, than replaced that split cap I mentioned which is on the S5 computing line. Changed the cap than checked the rest of the rails which is why I'm guessing computing was lower, as PPBUS is now also 12.25v. Cap I replaced it with may of been faulty though it did not read shorted when I checked it before and after installation. \n\nSince missing PMSLP is usually dead PCH what resistances would you normally expect on a 2.7 8GB?\nl7310 & L7320 I'm getting 9 ohm to ground on both."
