            "message": "HI there. I have an intermittent issue with this board that I am able to replicate. Currently its pulling 130ma off the charger @18.5V. There was no liquid damage on this board. If I unplug and re-insert the magsafe (off the DC power supply set @19V) over and over, eventually this board will turn on. When it doesnt turn on, PPBUS_G3H fluctuates 7-9V, and PLT_RESET_L is 0v, all other voltages are within spec. It seems as though it will only turn on with a genuine 85W power supply, and not the 60W. IT will not stay powered on very long running off battery (too low voltage?)\n\nI have replaced:\nU7000\nU4900\nQ7030\nQ7035\nQ7950\n\nConnecting a genuine 60W magsafe - No boot\nConnecting a genuine 85W Magsafe - Boot\nDC Power supply set @ 16.5V - No boot\nDC Power supply set @ 19V - Boot (but sometimes not)\n\nWhat should I be checking next?"

There is no change to boot (no power up @16.5v) powers up fine @19v. PPBUS+G3H is now normal @12.6v after these components have been replaced. PLT_RESET is still low (0.22v) and the green light on the charger slightly flickers while plugged in @16.5V (the same as when doing an SMC reset)"
