I replaced diode on DC Inboard and logic board turned on and booted. Keyboard was also damaged. Would not get green light on charger and no fan with old keyboard installed. Replaced keyboard and everything was working for a while. Started to reinstall OSX and during at some point the board just started to cycle 1 fan spin continuously. PP5V_S3 is missing. PP3V3_S5 was there but was flaky. Now n missing as well and no spin at all. G3Hot 12.5V, PP3V42 3.42V, PPVINRTC 3.4V, PPBUS_S5_HS_Computing_ISNS 12.5V, PPDCIN 16.7V. Missing both enables on U7200. Pin 16 12.5 V.\n\nThank you."

How do you think that happened? IDK...  Just finished putting everything back and fan is now spinning. I will install board and run diags and hope for the best.\n\nI'm no Genius, but something tells me there was an easier way to do this, if I wasn't half retarded and better understood the acronyms and functionality of some of these IC's in the schematic. :)\n\nThanks for your help.

This could probably have been solved by just replacing U7200 in the first place. But since I didnt realize I wasnt supposed to be getting voltage on ENTRIP pins I kept (frustratingly) messing around with it. Thank you for the informing me. I appreciate it.\n\n1 more thing - \n\nComputer is now running and passed diagnostics, but I notice a delay in chime from when I hear the optical drive power up. Like 3-4 seconds. Any thoughts?"
