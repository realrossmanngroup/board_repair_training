            "message": "Hello All,\n\nI've known Louis for awhile, but I haven't needed to post on the forum.  I recently acquired a 2015 15\" Retina MacBook Pro A1398 in amazing condition with a 661-00679 board inside.  The machine was damaged by a coffee spill which has caused interesting behavior, I was hoping someone has seen this before and can point me in the correct direction.\n\nWhen I got the machine, it was showing an orange light on the charger and booting to the decryption prompt (bootloader) where keyboard and trackpad appeared to be working correctly.  I attempted to boot the machine from USB (High Sierra Installer), Recovery, Internet Recovery, and an Ubuntu USB drive.  When the machine would appear to be fully through the boot process and attempt to transfer into user mode (where the progress bar goes away and the GUI shows up) it would reboot.  Attempting a verbose boot did not provide any useful information (kernel panics, etc) that would explain the reboot.  Apple Diagnostics appears to freeze at 99% and never produces a result.\n\nI took the machine apart and there was *lots* of dried coffee inside.  The battery was sitting at 0.8v per cell (tested with a DMM) and the charge controller on the battery was heavily corroded.  I removed the battery and cleaned any visible corrosion off the board with 99% isopropyl.  I cleaned the coffee out of the case.  There was no change in the behavior of the system when powered from a good 85W Magsafe2 adapter.\n\nI have a new battery and keyboard on order (since the current keyboard is sticky).  Has anyone run into this behaivor before?  Where should I look?  If I can't easily test, I'll send it into Rossmann for a repair since I'm not the best with Microsoldering and don't want to destroy the logic board in this very nice system.\n\nThanks in advance, I'd be happy to provide any voltages necessary to troubleshoot.\n\n-Jamie"

Much appreciated. \n\nBTW, I removed the corroded battery with a piece of 24ga copper wire (from inside a Cat5 cable) and a can of compressed air.  The adhesive on the battery gives up pretty quickly when cold.  Made it much easier."
