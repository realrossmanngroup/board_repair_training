            "message": "MacBook Pro has no signs of liquid damage, power on quickly and fine, passes Apple Diagnostics but kernel panics on startup of any OS. The kernel panic is weird though because no kernel extensions are in backtrace, all it says is Thread 0 crashed. I have kind of narrowed this down to being a CPU issue, a PCH issue, or an SMC issue.\n\nHowever it being the SMC is unlikely, when in SMC bypass mode, the same kernel panic happens, however when I reset the SMC, the OS loads a little bit more then kernel panics.\n\nEDIT: In the image, you cannot really see what's above it too well, but this is where the panic starts, it says at the top: panic (cpu 2 caller): initproc exited -- no exit reason available -- (signal 6, exit status 0)\n\nEDIT 2: Noticing when booting an OS, and it kernel panics, shortly after (15 seconds) it restarts, it will restart again, almost like a kernel panic in the EFI. I also noticed when measuring PPBUS G3H, the voltage is 10.4V, for a 820-3787, is this too high or too low?\n\nEDIT 3: Noticing this seems to be happening when the CPU changes power stages. Would changing U7310,U7320,U7330 stop the panic?\n\n[ATTACH alt=\"IMG_1146-min.jpg\"]59251[/ATTACH]"
