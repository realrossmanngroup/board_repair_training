Removed the Fuse. Checked one by one and found C7620 Short. Replaced that and now the Short is gone.\nAs soon as i put in a new fuse and powered it on. The fuse burned. I guess there is some short which i am unable to find.\n\nCurrently No Fuse on the board.\n\nVoltage on Pin#2 is 0.7V\nVoltage on Pin#1 is 8.6V\n\nRequesting help."
