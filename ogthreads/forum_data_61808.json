            "message": "Hello. Got this board here with no power. 20V on charger. If I let it plugged off for some minutes, the first time I plug it in it negotiates 20V with charger and draws around 300mA for some seconds. When this happens I have 1.05V on L7370 but no voltage on L7220 or L7210. Then, after some seconds the board stops drawing current and stays 20V with 0A. If it plug it off and let it sit on the bench for some minutes the same thing occurs again, 0.3Amps for some seconds then nothing. Where should I start?"
