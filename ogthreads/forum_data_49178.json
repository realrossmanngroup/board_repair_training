            "message": "Hey guys, \n\nWorking on 820 3476 with short on PP3V42_G3H! \n\nmore precisely i have a short on pin 2 L7095. With my Power supply i put a wire with 1V on pin pin 2 for find the bad component and only heat r8131! But the stupid think is i remove the R8131 and when i put 1v on L7095 the pin 1 off r8131 keeps burning. when i put ?lcool isoprop?lico on area off r8131 i can see the alcohol evaporate at the pin1 off r8131. I don't have others components heating on this board!  \n\nAlready replace U7100 for a new one and same history! \n\nHow do I find this short?? \n\nThanks"
