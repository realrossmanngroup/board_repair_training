            "message": "Hey Guys.\n\nI have this A1708 no backlight.  On Q8400 pin i have 12.6v and pin 3 12.6 also. I checked C8400, R8401(80.6k) and R8402 all good so the voltage divider works good no issue there and when measured direct pin 3 to 4 on Q8400 it's 80k. I have input on U8400 on pin 5 and 18 i don't have output. All resistors around U8400 are good expect R8432 which should be 150k but it's 24.1. I removed it but then when measured directly it's 150k and i get diode value on LCDBKLT_FB. Also i noticed that R8440 which should be 1m it's 0.86 on 1m scale. Ideas?"

When you connect the charger it display fine on the screen the battery level but when you power on the device it display on the background but no backlight. I have tried to plug external screen with usb c adapter but no luck. The backlight IC  system seems to be working fine gives 51v-54v on D8410 when its on but doesnt want to  give backlight image on. i have tried to go on recovery mode but it doesnt seems to be working that either. Any suggestions?"
