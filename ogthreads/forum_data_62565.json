No fan spin.\n\nU7200 generates PP5V_S5 and has 5V when measured at pin 1 of C7273.\n\nHowever, when measure the same PP5V_S5 at C7801, it is only 3.05V. But when I tried to measure the continuity between pin 1 of C7273 and pin 1 C7801, they dont seem to be connected. When looked carefully the test point/circular pad that is next to pin 1 of C7273 is gone."
