            "message": "Hi. I have an A1278  that after 30 seconds the screen scrambles. At first, my thought was that it was going to be an LCD/cable replacement. I removed the board to look it it over and found that U2600 and the area around it was liquid damaged. I have already replaced the damaged components and everything is functioning normal. My question is; can you give me a general idea of how this damaged circuit effected the display image? I am currently tracing through the schematic but a hint would definitely be helpful. Thanks in advance."

            "message": "No... Tapping on board and RAM slot didn't make a difference. It would boot up, get to OS for like 30 seconds. Then the screen would go white with full spectrum of color static, then go black. After that happened a couple times that computer would just not POST anymore, just turn on with fans at full throttle. Thats when I pulled the board and notice the damage on U2600 and surrounding area. Its no biggie, everything is working now since component replacement. I was just curious to know how problem with u2600 would effect LCD in that way. Thanks."
