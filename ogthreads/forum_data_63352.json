I tried reflow on SMC, I replaced U7501 with no changes... No short lines all diode modes are good. I found that when plugged in only U7100 warms up to 30 degrees and stays like that. I have a green light changes to orange and stays like that, also tried with multiple original known good adapters.\n\nAny ideas pls? Thanks"
