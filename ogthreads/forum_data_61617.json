            "message": "Got a bit of a strange one here 820-00430 iMac 21.5\" Logic Board. \n\nWe have replaced the PSU in this iMac previously a few months back but it has been brought back in with no power - no lights on the logic board but the PSU is outputting 11.85V and PP12V_G3H is present. PP12V_S5 is not however. \n\nI'm using the schematic for the 820-00034 board as I cannot find one for the 820-00430 - would I be correct in assuming that Q6970 is a likely culprit? My only confusion is that Q6970 on the schematic is a 3 leg IC but on the board itself the IC in this position appears to have 8 legs?"
