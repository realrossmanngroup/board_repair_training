            "message": "My 2010 MBP runs perfectly - until it crashes: instantaneous shut down.\nLeft alone it reboots by itself or by pressing power button. Sometimes hangs when booting.\n\nCrashes began following installation of OWC Mercury SSD - all ESD precautions taken\nTime Between Failures varies from 30 seconds to 10-15 minutes\nAppears somewhat linked to workload/screen activity/temperature but I could be mistaken\n\nPaid a tech 100 bucks to tell me it's the logic board\ncurrently replacing C9560 with Alum/Poly Cap - prophylactic if nothing else\n\nSymptoms are different from most reported graphics problems with 2850\nAny suggestions welcome\n\n(nil formal electronics training)"
