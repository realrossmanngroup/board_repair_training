            "message": "I've heard of this issue, but never actually encountered it. Working on an 820-2936 that works fine, but the battery drains as if it's in S0 while it's in sleep/S3/S4. I'm honestly not even sure where to start; maybe one of the power state enables/switches? Customer reports \"when I put the unit to sleep each night, even with 50%+ charge, it's dead in the morning and I have to plug the charger in and battery is at 0%\".\n\nIt just came in today, so I'm testing it now, but is there anything I can look at/for to help narrow down the cause? Would it be something as simple as a bad ISL? The board is very clean, no damage/drops or anything, just this rapid-drain issue. Genuine battery, charger, etc. Issue occurs with multiple different drives and RAM as well (customer purchased duplicates of each thinking that was the issue). Thanks in advance for all help!"
