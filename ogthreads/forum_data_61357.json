Gettting readings from all big coils including VCORE but VCORE is not dropping, it's steady at 0.97V when board is pulling  19.9V.\n\nWith board in there is trackpad activity but no caps lock.\n\nMedusa works and was able to cleanME and reset PRAM. \n\nNo history and no signs of liquid on board. Connectors look good."
