            "message": "Hi, I have an A1708 non Touch Bar MBP and the issue I have is that when you open the screen past 30degrees the Mac freezes. The mouse cursor stops moving. I have done an NVRAM and SMC Reset, booted to an external macOS disk and the issue persists. I am wondering if it is the same as this video -- [MEDIA=youtube]NzjoELvrkYo[/MEDIA] , here you guys say that its one the screen flex cables which can not be replaced and a new screen is required. Can you advise on this please ? \n\nThanks Bob"
