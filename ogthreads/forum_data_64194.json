I hear the chime too sometimes.\n\nWhen checking with an Amp Meter it goes upto 20V and then the amp meter restarts after some seconds.\n\nThis is happening in the all 3 ports. (With Battery Disconnected).\n\nPPBUS_AON is at 12.3V and cycling too because of the amp meter i guess.\n\nPlease help ho to proceed."
