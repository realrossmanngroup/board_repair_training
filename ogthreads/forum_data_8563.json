I was able to retrieve the Data off of the ssd and thought I'd see if I get good karma and try and fix the Macbook too.  It looks like there is no actual fire damage just water damage.  I've put it through the Crest and afterwards it did show the low battery connected symbol but now I tried giving it some power to work on it and nothing.  \n\nQ. Is there a sticky topic on trouble shooting power issues?"

Also nothings changed other than there is no PP3V3_S3. So let's not start over.  What gives power to PP5V_S3 and PP3V3_S3?  You said PM_SLP_S4_L .   Ok so let's look at that. Looks like system power management maybe? \n\nI have:\nOrange/Green light\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.4v\n\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.4v\n\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.4v\n\nPP5V_S3 = 0v (measured at Pin 1 of L4001 and many other places)\n\nPP3V3_S3 = 0v\n\nIf I can get a direction to go for I'm happy to do the research."

I'm turning 40 this week so........ anyways the whole damn board was hit with a firehose. No really it was from a fire. It didn't get hot and there was no black marks on it.  The board looked like a bucket full of shit but after the crest cleaning it did show me the battery dead symbol and after that I couldn't get it to boot.   I realize this might be a dead end but I'm really learning so much and you are the man!  Also it worked just for a second arg!  I'd really like to know what the pulse signifies.  Is that a pulse to switch states or is it a short to ground pulse?  My mom says she'll bake you extra special cookies.  I just wish she'd put on a shirt."

This also happens when the ROM cannot be read, clock signals are missing or pretty much any other reason. Pulsing power can therefore be anything.\nMost likely areas of corrosion are around SPI ROM and clock chip or U1950. There is no easy diagnostic for this problem and even for me would not be an easy repair."
