            "message": "Hello. This board came to me about 2 months ago dead. Shorted PPBUS_G3H. I fixed the short and the board worked for the next 1 or 2 months. Last week costumer brought it back with a strange symptom. If the machine is left off for about 10 minutes it starts one time. No matter if you leave it on for 5 seconds or 1 hour, if you shut it down it won't power again immediately. If I leave it sitting on the bench for some minutes it turns on again for one time and does the same. When it stops working I have quarter fan spin. All S0 coils pulse during the quarter fan except the CPU VCORE ones. Any ideas?"
