All pins except GND measure resistance to ground.\n\nSSD_PWR_EN, PP3V3_S0, SSD_RESET_CONN_L, SSD_CLKREQ_CONN_L, SSD_PCI_SEL_L are 3.4V\nFlashed BIOS, replaced SMC\n\nOf course tested with known-good SSD.\n\nLast thing on my mind is the PCH, or am I missing something?"

I couldn't figure out how to do a continuity test without an extra set of arms or soldering a jumper wire to each Cap so I re-flowed them and it worked. I never would have suspected them as they were as clean as the rest of the board, it never had a Liquid spill but it was overheating badly when I replaced the display and did a thermal a few weeks earlier."
