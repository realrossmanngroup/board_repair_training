As can be seen on the pictures ? there is some corrosion. Cleaned it up with alcohol and Qtip ? now macbook starts and seems to be working. At this moment don't have password to log in and test macbook, but it might be fixed. Thank you both for your assistance. Btw, how much such repair would cost? How much does your shops charge? Luckily repair was simple, but still... customer would never figure out the problem and, if not repair shop, would most likely buy new computer."
