I've replaced that and the green light goes nicely to orange.  But fan stays at high speed throughout. \n\nNo power in the backlight circuit.  Looks like there's no signal on LCD_BCKLT_EN but there is 8v on LCD_BCKLT_EN_L on Q9707. Is that normal?\n\nsome of the coils appear shorted to ground - L7100, L7720 and L7630  and every other coil towards the fan;  and U1800 is getting hot to touch.  all are at about 45C.  \n\nany thoughts on chasing down the short?  alcohol test does not show anything particularly hotter than other things.  likewise an infrared heat scan (with a gun).  \n\nthanks\nJustin"

L7330 is a little better at about 1k .\n\nI've prodded at most things that seem like a culprit and I'm not finding any bad caps or similar . None of the passives are getting super hot.   And I get the boot chime (no SSD so no OS . I will create a usb boot drive tomorrow).  \n\nIs this likely to be a bad u1800?  If so, I guess the board is a write off?  Or is it worth trying some heat on it?\n\nSeparately the screen connector started smoking around the backlight pins.  So I guess that wasn't as salvageable as i had originally hoped. It cleaned up nicely but probably was shorted inside. I've removed it now . The backlight pins of the cable have lost their copper but the underlying metal is still good.  The resistance to ground didn't change after removing the connector.  \n\nThe fuse went. So that's one positive!"

I get 3.3v coming in but the resistor divider is a different ratio to what's in the schematic.  I get 0.77v at the divider and 0.7v at the pin.  From the schematic I should be getting more than 1.05v at the divider.  \n\n2.  PP1V5_S3RS0_VMON.  I get 1.35v here and 0.78v at the pin.  This is higher than the stated worst threshold.\n\n3. PP1V05_SO_VMON.  I get 1.05v where it should be and 0.78v at the pin again.  Higher than the worst case threshold.\n\nso the odd one out is pp3v3_SO_MON via the resistor divider.  \n\nFor the resistor divider I measure \nR7951 at 9,4kOhm\n\nR7952 at 6.1kOhms\n\nso a divider ration of 0.39  \n\nwhereas it should be 0.33.  \n\non the collector of Q1 I am seeing on 200mV despite having 3.3v on PP3V3_S5.\n\nso I removed Q7950 and I'm now seeing the right voltages on the pads.  So I guess that Q7950 was fried?  is that a reasonable assumption?"

Remove the chip and all the voltages are correct at the pins.  \n\ngiven the chip design, doesn't this suggest an internal short across some of the bases?  that would also stop the bases from rising high enough to turn on the transistors and thus the mosfet.  If there were a short on all_sys_pwd gd after the mosfet then we shouldn't see the issues across the bases of the transistors would we?  \n\nIf this is not the culprit, can you point me towards others?  the all_sys_pwrgd line on this board (the BJT version) is quite simple so I couldn't think of anything else!"
