Im a bit stuck as i havent seen this issue before.\nAnyone seen this behaviour? \n\nThankfully i have testing parts and a known good shell that ive tested this in, It is not to do with peripherals. Ive also tested it on an external drive and found the same issue."

I will try a clean ME bios, although its not been messed with before sometimes ive seen bios corruption due to liquid damage.\n\nThanks"
