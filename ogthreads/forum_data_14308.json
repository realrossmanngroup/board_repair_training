EFI test was passed with no errors and I am now running the OS part of the test - before the test was available and while it was looking for tests to run, another window was there titled TCON CONFIG UPDATER - which then disappeared.\n\nAny ideas what was that? And if what it updated could be the solution?\n\nThe test needs quite some time to finish - I will report back.\n\nbr,\ngeorge"

            "message": "unfortunately I had to give it back before thoroughly testing it - I think the guy will buy a new mobo from Apple.\n\nI only managed to run OS ASD a few times only to discover that it crashed at some point (I was not watching so I dont know when exactly) with black screen and fans at high. A big drawback of the ASD tests is that the auto-saving log is not auto-saving after every test module but probably at the end which in this case was never reached.\n\nthanks duke, till the next one.\n\nEDIT: photo uploaded"
