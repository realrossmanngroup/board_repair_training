Pins 1,3,5,7,9,11,13 were completely melted away so I removed the connector and dug and scraped until the short was gone. I tried to power on board and it is at 20mA and Missing PP5V_S4. I measured it and it is not short, actually it is 1M resistance. I checked all the power aliases up to PP5V_S4 but am stumped with where to go from here."
