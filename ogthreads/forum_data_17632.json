            "message": "I have this 15\" 2011 MBP that was not liquid damaged. The fans spin and the cd drive turns on along with hdd light flashes but I get no video.\n\nI tried a PRAM reset but it didn't seem to work. I removed the RAM sticks and turned the machine on and I got the beeping sounds.\n\nI even tried plugging in another working display assembly but I still wasn't getting the screen recognized. \nBoth displays I plugged in showed 0.1v on Pin 1 U9000(LCD_PWR_EN).\n\nI replaced the DC-in board since it looked a little damaged.\nWhen I plug the charger in to the board only without battery the fans spin for 1-2 secs then turn off then come back on after a second and continue spinning.\n\nI figure this might be the GPU issue but I'm not sure."
