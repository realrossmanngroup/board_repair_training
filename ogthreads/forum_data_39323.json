Fully functional\n\nI swapped out the SSD to do some data recovery on an equivalent drive and when that was complete, swapped the old drive back in.  Dead.  Obviously worked on anti-static basis and drive was not dropped or anything.  \n\nis there any decent way to diagnose a bust SSD?  schematics/board views for them etc? \n\nthe logic board for the A1369 still works and the recovered SSD still works too.  \n\nFYI, done the SMC and pRAM reset.\n\ntia\nJustin"
