            "message": "Hi 2 Informaticos, team,\n\nI have this board on which they claimed had a WD but I didn't found any corrosion anywhere......\nas this board is old I checked the resistance of pp3v42 to GND to make sure this is not a bad MCP failure: 0.8M Ohms: OK\n\n[B]ppbus_g3h:8.17V [/B]\npp3v42: 3.42V\n\nat U7000:\nR17/18: 20.8Ohms\nR27/28: 20.5 Ohms OK\nBut what is weird in my case is that I have an [B]ISL6259 mounted instead of ISL6258[/B]\nBoard is turning ON on battery with ppbus 11.55V and the charger light turns green, once the battery is removed I can turn it ON/OFF by triggering R5015/16\n\nOn charger only, it turns in SMC bypass mode.\nWhen the board is ON, the fan spins to the max speed like I have a Current/Voltage sensing issue.......\nReflowed SMC still the same\n\nQuestion: Could that happen that on this boards they mounted ISL6259 or is it a mistake on borad or schematics?"
