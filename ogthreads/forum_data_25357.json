Often these are related in a way and I end up resolving both.\n\nDoes it never have a charging light or does the light dim after the system powers off? From your post I think always?\n\nWhat's the voltage of SMC_ONOFF_L and other SMC RESET signals? Often when weird SMC related issues occur this voltage is slightly dropping to somewhere between 2.3 and 2.9V. Also keep an eye on PPBUS_G3H with a fast response multimeter, see if it drops"
