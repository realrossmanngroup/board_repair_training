I have a mac mini here that plays normal sound through speakers and external display however, when earphones are plugged in, it shows that the earphones are connected but it doesn't play any sound through them. The I/O bezel and logic board seemed good, so i went ahead and set up a new OS however, the problem still exists. Any further troubleshooting tips?"
