It boots up and chimes, but no image to the display or to HDMI. \n\nLCD_PWR_EN: 0v\nEP3V3GPU_EN: 0v\nGPUVCORE_EN: 0v\nPPVCORE_S0_GFX_REG: 0v (resistance check is 16ohm approx on PH2 and 18ohms approx on PH1) but assuming this is due to the GPUVCORE_EN being 0v\n\nI replaced U9100 with no change. (Does this chip have to be from a donor board or can one purchase online (like digi-key) work, as this is what i did)?\n\nAny suggestions"
