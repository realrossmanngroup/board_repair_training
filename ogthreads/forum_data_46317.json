The one on the 00165 board has one triangle pointing away from ground towards the horizontal bar. All donor board diodes I have seen have 2 triangles pointing towards each other. Is this just a slightly different symbol still meaning the same? Can I still use those on the donor boards? I also ordered some monsters, as you put it , but perfect for my currently still limited skill level: [URL]https://www.ebay.ca/itm/291528748673[/URL]. In case the donor board double triangle diodes are not useful..."

Just wondering if you would help me clear up a bit of foggy understanding as far as orientation goes? I suppose I can determine the orientation of the diode I will harvest by measuring resistance and that way determine which way the one way valve for current is oriented, right? And then install it accordingly with the non conducting side to ground. Is that right?

Well, if nothing else it was good exercise in removing diodes from the donor boards. I added leaded solder as I removed them from the donor board, at least they cannot get away that easy, and I have them primed with leaded solder ready to reinstall. After a lot of tries I did get it into place. Would have been so cool if that would have done the trick, since there are lots of them on the old board in the audio circuits, but alas, no cigar. So I am back to zener diode shopping...Being in Canada makes buying stuff from Louis' website pretty expensive, shipping is over the top, for reasons beyond my comprehension."
