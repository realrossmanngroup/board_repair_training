Currently this is what the board does (removed from the case):\n\nConnect to power, 20V and 1.4-1.7A, attempts to boot. Shuts off about 4 seconds later, stays at 20v 0A.\nBoots again, 20V and 1.4-1.7A. Stays on for approximately 10 seconds then shuts off and remains at 20v 0A\nWhen board is installed and battery connected, normal operation but shuts off/reboots randomly while in use and sleeping.\n\nI have replaced ISL 9239 in hopes it was just a charge controller issue. No change."

            "message": "This MacBook was purchased in working condtition and the top case, screen, and battery were all replaced. It was in my posession and worked beautifully for a week before I sold it to a customer. It started acting up days later after a faulty/cheap USB-C cable was used for charging. I have had it back in my shop four times and the last time I reflowed the ISL9239 chip and that fixed it for about two weeks. There is absolutely no liquid/corrosion damage.\n\nI went ahead and installed the board again and connected the battery and now its powering on. Its also powering up with the battery disconnected. I have done nothing other than re-install it into the case."
