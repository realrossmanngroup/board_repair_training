            "message": "I was testing and saw low resistance on PP3v3_G3H_RTC at one of the CD3217 U3100_T. I thought easy problem. Swapped the CD3217, tested diode and was normal. Powered it up and nothing. Checked it again and it seemed like it was blown again same spot but then I realized that if I waited a while after unplugging the charger the resistance would be back up to normal. Something is lowering resistance on that rail after connecting to charger. It's been a minute but I feel like U3100_T charging port was only one not drawing any amperage but all other ports were just over 5V drawing some amps.\n\nSo I think something related to that port... could something with U2800_T cause that? Does that chip have firmware or can I pull from different model board like 01958 2020 macbook air board? I don't have 01949 donor."

All seemed good and it boots, but after you turn it off, it wouldn't boot up again without letting it sit a long time (usually have to wait until the next day). It seems to be on as when I check it there is data activity. Internal screen stays off (no image/backlight) but external screen sticks to Apple logo. I successfuylly tried revive, no change. I let it sit so I could check it with hardware test and that shows no issues. I was able to restore it but issue persists. I've been unable so far to get it through recovery/reload. I'm a bit baffled as to what's happening. It seems like it just stalls out and display never comes on."

I tried putting board back in original to test and right side doesn't work anymore. I have 5V for PPVOUT_S0_KBLED at J8400/1. If I press the keyboard light option on the touch bar I don't get the popup that either would normally show it can't be adjusted or that it is adjusting."
