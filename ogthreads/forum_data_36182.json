I had to replace U3100,U7650, Q7680 and fix a couple of missing traces.\n\nbefore rework iget no voltages anywhere at all. after U3100 area rework, I get 20v on PP20V but sometime I get 5.2v then give it a minute or so then the voltage rise to 20v.\n\n\nppbus_g3h = 13v\npp3v3_s5 = 0.4v\nPP3V3_LDO3V = 3.3\n3V3_S5_SMC = 3.3\npp3v3_g3h 3.4\nPP3V1_RTC = 3v\nPP3V3_G3H_UPC_XA 3.3v\n\nPP5V_S5 = 0\nPP5V_S4 = 0v\n\nSMC_PM_G2_EN = 3.4V\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0V\nALL_SYS_PWRGD = 0V\n\n\n\nDo i have a dead SMC or U7800?\n\n\ni have two 820-00840 donor boards. what stencil pitch size i use on this new SMC?"
