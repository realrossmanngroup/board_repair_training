            "message": "This is ohms Law ;)\nIf you have R1 and R2 in series you can calculate the total resistance R[SUB]T[/SUB]=R1+R2\nExample:\nR1=1M\u03a9\nR2=2M\u03a9\n\n==> R[SUB]T[/SUB]=1M\u03a9+2M\u03a9=3M\u03a9\n\nBUT if you have Resistors in parallel you have to do this calculation:\n[ATTACH]2394._xfImport[/ATTACH]\nBecause there is another resistor in parallel in your case the U6990, the R[SUB]T[/SUB] will always be less than 1M\u03a9!\nOne important point to remember about resistors in parallel, is that the total circuit resistance of any two resistors connected together in parallel will always be [B]LESS[/B] than the value of the smallest resistor in that combination.\nYou can test it if you unsolder R6995 and measure the resistance of the pads. You will get the value of U6990 witch has to be over 0.5M\u03a9 but less than 1M\u03a9 :)"
