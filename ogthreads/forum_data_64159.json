            "message": "820-01700 presented with no obvious damage.  Customer says wouldn't wake from sleep one day.  This is the board with the \"left side SSD controller corrosion problem\", so I looked there first and found the smallest of evidence of the usual corrosion *beginning* to occur.  I saw just a little bit of tin dust.  I didn't reball it yet but the SSD readings seemed normal to me, diode mode too.\n\nThe first issue is that it's [B]boot looping immediately on the \"A\" upper ports [/B](TA, XA), [B]but boot looping differently: after negotiating 20V @ .06A briefly on the lower \"B\" ports[/B]. \n\nThis happens usually.  There is a \"sometimes\" event as well where everything is working fine (after something discharges overfnight? ). When \"sometimes\" happens, it pulls charging current, charges the battery, PPBUS goes full and everything is hunky dory. Screen lights up and all that.  This happens for about a minute, then the charger is reset and we're back to square one. \n\nThe second issue (likely related) is that port XA (U3100) refuses to power on my ammeter at all, or keeps it reset when the machine's battery / battery data cable is connected.  I replaced the CD3217 there to identical symptoms. Diode mode and resistance on all LDOs seem normal, CLK too.  Did the beep test on all major anything I could see, nothing out of the ordinary. I think the battery is fine?  I have that sweet Romanian battery tester, I should use it.\n\nAny suggestions here? PMU inductor inspection? ILS9240? Replace every CD3217?  The one I replaced is from another 01700, same positioning."
