            "message": "Hi ive got an 820-00150 that came in totally dead , (charger faulty) had to replace 4 usb controllers and isl9240 , now board working apart from if you close the lid the laptop will not wake the screen, same on battery power or mains power , you have to hold your finger on the power button to force off then power on again and screen will display , even if you tell the laptop to turn off , wait for it to shut down then close the lid and try to turn on , no display again, would it be u6650 as this looks like it controls both left and right smc lid sensors, or am i in the complete wrong place ?"
