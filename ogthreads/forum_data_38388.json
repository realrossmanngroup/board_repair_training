            "message": "Got a Mac air of which the trackpad is frozen. Keyboard works. I changed the trackpad, same result. Measuring pin 10 of the trackpad connector it showed 0.5-1V not 3.3. After removing the board and no trackpad connected, its 3.3v. R4830 os 0 ohms as it should be. Any ideas?\n\nOn a sidenote, there was a tiny liquid spil on C7555 near U7201 which after i replaced the IC and made a wire the mac worked again. Customer had issues with trackpad before the mac died. No liquid on cable.trackpad looks very clean."
