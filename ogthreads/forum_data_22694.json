I'm not worried about getting any money for them, I just want them to go to someone maybe in New York or somewhere else with a little more international influence than where I am. I'm pretty sure they all work. May have a missing BIL. Trackpads have been pulled. Not sticky. I can't send them outside of the U.S. but let me know if you live in the U.S. and have a need for them."
