            "message": "I've got a liquid damaged (but pre-cleaned) 820-00165A that isn't spinning up.  The liquid damage _appears_ to have been pooling around the edge of the board with some residual grubbiness around the SMC and the RAM chips.  \n\nThe G3H rails are present and the green->orange charger light is as normal.\n\nAn oddity is that PPVRTC_G3H oscillates between 3.3 and 3.42v.\n\nThe PPV5_S5 rail is present but again it oscillates.  This time between 3.6 and 5v.  \n\nno other power rails are active.\n\non U7501 I'm getting lows on EN and EN1 and on EN2 I'm getting an oscillating 0-3v. \n\nany ideas of where to hunt please?\n\nthanks\njustin"

I will check the spi bus but again - this feels like a different kind of issue on the S5 5v regulator circuit. Like a diode failing as a cap discharges perhaps."
