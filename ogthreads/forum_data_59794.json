            "message": "Hey guys! New forum style, neat. Haven't been here in a while lol.\n\nSo I've been dealing with this guy for a while--original problem had no backlight, had some liquid damage around backlight chips/lvds connector, cleaned 'em up and resoldered new connector. Have image, but still no backlight.\n\nNoticed pin 3 of Q7706 (LCDBKLT_EN_L) wasn't low enough (12.93v), but resistance showed good between pin 3/4 of Q7706 and of R7701 (80.6K) and had 3.3v on BKLT_EN_R. Ran wire from BKLT_SD to ground to see if I'd get backlight, still nothing but now LCDBKLT_EN_L is proper 5.5v and 1/2/5/6 Q7706 (PPBUS_SW_BKL) is 13.06v, passing thru PPBUS_G3H. PPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT_PWR_SW and PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT are ditto, 13.06v.\n\nI believe I read that this is due to something with Q7701 being off? But that thread referenced a situation where BKLT_SD didn't have to be manually shorted, and I couldn't find much else, so I offer this to you guys.  :)"

It's probably the I/O board cable as I saw it had some corrosion on one end--will replace and update with if it fixed."
