PP3V42_G3H line to SMC_ONOFF_L resistance is 30ohm but it must 8.5-9K around ( i checked with known good board)\n\nAlso changed R5070 and removed U5010 nothing changed, only when removed SMC resistance is ok ..\n\nReplaced 5th SMC but same resistance and 1.5V is same :(  soo no green light or no power.\n\nWhere can i check next step ..."

I see in your other thread you are measuring ohms with battery plugged in, you can't do that!\nIt makes no sense that multiple SMC give the same problem. It can only be shit around U5110 as there is nothing else connected besides SMC, U5110 and C5710, R5710."
