Probably a bad chip, was an old date code from a supplier i havent tried prior, im waiting for my china shipment to come in and im in a bit of a pickle with no chips atall and customers not wanting to wait. \n\nI think i have but i cant remember, done a bunch of them and for the last 6 months ive just replaced 084's with 005's only having to change the BOM config resistors."
