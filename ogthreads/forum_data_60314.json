            "message": "Hi, this is my 1st post !\nThis 2017 macbook pro 15\" shows low battery icon on screen powered only with the charger in all 4 tipe-C ports.\n \nWith the charger + battery, PP20V_USBC_ is pulsing from 5V to 0V on 3 ports, the port managed by UB400 gets 20V and shows apple logo for 2sec and then turns off.\nIf I try the port managed by UB300 imediatelly after trying the \"good port\" managed by UB400 PP20V_USBC_ will jump to 20V and will show on screen the apple logo for 2 or 3 sec an then turns off but PP20_USBC_ will stay at 20.26V.\nthe port managed by U3100 is the only port that boots through SMC bypass with the fans in full speed and does not recognize the battery.\nthe port related to U3200 will stay pulsing from 5 to 0V.\n\nU3100, UB300, U3200 have been replaced in that order together with U7000.\n\nBefore the replacements this macbook was also showing low battery icon using only the charger in all ports with 20V on PP20V_USBC_ and with the charger + battery had 5V in 3 ports but had 20V on port managed by UB400 showing low battery as well.\n\nsome measurements:\n\nPPBUS_G3H 12.57V\nPP3V3_G3H 3.4V\nSMC_BC_ACOK 3.4V\nCHGR_BMON 0.0V with & without battery\nPP5V_S4_X_USBC 0.0V\nPP5V_S4_T_USBC 0.0V\n\nThis motherboard had no sings of water damage or corrosion, any thoughts?\n\nThanks!"
