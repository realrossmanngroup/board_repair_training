            "message": "Working on an 820-2936 with a bad audio jack. Headphones are detected when plugged in, but no sound/audio at all. Speakers work normally. Replaced the jack since they seem to die on this model, and same issue. Checked all resistors and filters on the circuit, and they all seem to read fine. I have 3.3v on pin 8 of J6700.\n\nReally at a loss here; any ideas of what I need to check next? Any help or direction appreciated."
