            "message": "I've seen several 820-00840 and 820-00875 boards the past ~3 months that all had the exact same symptoms; they power on (trackpad clicks), ppbus is stable at 13v, but there's no other progress/booting. All boards are perfectly clean with no history of drop/liquid/etc. They all came in with similar descriptions, \"stopped powering on\". I have tried loading new BIOS's on a few of the boards, and it didn't help, so I put the original back on each. No shorts found across all coils, nothing getting hot except CPU (gets appropriately warm, etc). They all power on with trackpad click, fan spin, but no chime/boot/video, etc.\n\nI'm working on an 820-00840 board now, measurements below:\n\npp3v3_g3h: 3.4v\nppbus_g3h: 13.06v\nall_sys_pwrgd: 3.22v\npp2v9_sysclk: 3.0v\npp3v1_rtc: 3.09v\npm_slp_s0_l: 3.3v\nGTVR_FCCM: .022v\nUSB Mouse light flickers for literally .1 seconds then no activity.\n\nALL_SYS looks very slightly low, but everything else looks fine. CPU gets warm as normal, but no chime/boot/etc. Any ideas?\n\nThanks in advance!"
