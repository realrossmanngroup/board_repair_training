I replaced this and cleaned damage around the area and also replaced U4830.\nThe board still has no trackpad.\n\n5v is present on L4800 and voltages at U4830 all appear to be normal.\nThe 5v makes it all the way up to J4801 and I can't find corrosion damage on anything in this area.\nI am a little nervous here because I am thinking the trackpad could of surged the CPU lines. This was a water damaged board.\n\nThoughts?"
