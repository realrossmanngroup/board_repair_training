I was hoping something \"easier\" would pop out, but it is what it is.\n\nAs for history, water went through keyboard. 12 pictures are attached where corrosion was found.\n\nI still haven't done my homework on newer Macbooks, so I was hoping if this one could be a \"noob\" guide from start to hopefully happy end.\n\nSo what are your first thoughts?"

It is very helpful on newer machines: [url]https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BP3ZXDT/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_sA6tBbC25KRX3[/url]\n\nAs for your board, you WILL need an OEM 87 watt brick and cable to rule out any variables with aftermarket crap. First thing to measure is if you get 5 volts or 20 volts on PPDCIN_G3H"
