            "message": "I had a return cross my bench.  The original repair was R7121 and R7122 on U7100 were out of spec.  \" not close to 10 ohms \".  Well it's back and they are bad once more.   I assume I have to replace U7100 but wanted feed back from others out there.  I don't understand how U7100 could fail like this.  The original repair lasted for three weeks before failing again.  I have measured both of these lines to ground and resistance is infinite."
