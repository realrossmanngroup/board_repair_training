            "message": "Hi Duke,\n\non this board i had no power ( no green light). A little bit of water was on the LIO board. On the LIO board i found a corroded contact point. After fixing that now i have a green light. The logic board itself looks absolutely fine. But machine is not powering on. My meassurements show that there is no S3 state. S5 voltages are there. At the end i found out that there is no PM_SLP_S4_L. Now what to check?\nI looked at the schematics and wanted to meassure PP3V3_G3_RTC voltage but the schematic is confusing me. When i look at the schematic and compare this with the board view software than this voltage is called PP3V42_G3 in boardview software. Anyways this voltage is missing on R1920 and R1921.\nWhat is the next step to meassure? Any ideas?\nThank\u00b4s!"

If it really is not there then there must be a corroded trace. Also these boards do not auto power on, you need to short the power pads on the board."
