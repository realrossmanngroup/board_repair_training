Replaced, now get amber light but only pulling .2A on 18.5V supply.  Same on 85W genuine known good adapter.  \n\nFound PPDCIN not getting past dual Q7180.  AGATE voltage on left side is 15 volts, shouldn't this be brought down by u7100? CSON jumps.\n\nI've never had to do the logic chain stuff on the retina u7100 so please pardon if I do anything stupid.  I replaced the u7100 and q7180 just in case they were fried.\n\nBasic voltages:\n3.42 present obv\n\nu7100 (no battery)\n1. 15.36\n2. 16.35\n3. 3.9\n9. 1.06\n12. 3.39\n13. 3.26\n14. 3.066\n15. 0\n17. jumps around .500v to .800v or so\n19. 5.51 (isnt it supposed to be 5.1?)\n20. 5.51\n27. jumps between .226 and .336\n\nResistance 17+18 @ 3.4  //  27+28 @ 21.1"
