Ram is getting the proper voltage so I think I have pretty much narrowed it down to a bad ram chip and figured I would ask you guys if there is anything else I should check before I ebay it."

You could try heating the PCH to 150c for a few minutes and see if anything changes, but most likely this is junk. This is $169 when it works so removing every individual RAM chip and replacing them, only for it to be a bad PCH or some crack inside the PCB itself you can't see would be a real kick in the nuts."
