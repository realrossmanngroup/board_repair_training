The customer reported seeing a BIOS message while the screen was flickering during the Intel Display Driver installation. This was while the BIOS WRITE lock jumper was in place. Resulting in Loop restarting.\n\nAfterwards, the customer attempted flashing BIOS via a USB stick, resulting in turning and immediately shutting down unit NUC8I7HNK4.\n\nUnder the thermal cam, I can see that the CPU is initiating a heat signature for a second before it switches off.\n\nThere are two bioses in this model. There is also 3rd bios that is directly connected to the USBC chipset, so I am assuming that is not relevant to this case.\n\nNUC8I7HNK4 W25Q128JV SYS_SPI\nNUC8I7HNK4 W25X40CL GPU_SPI"
