But 0.9v - that isn't valid at all.\n\nIs PP3V3_S5 present?\n\nR1481 doesn't exist on this board. Either way, resistors used in these circuits fail to a higher resistance, not a lower resistance, so this doesn't count. Don't bother replacing resistors if they measure a lower resistance than their stated resistance and do not appear damaged. If something else is connecting point A to point B in other sections of the board you are measuring everything around the resistor as ell and of course if these paths exist you will see a lower resistance."
