            "message": "My reference only: TT9952\n\nIssue: Apple logo appears for about 2 seconds then screen goes black if timed just right when attempting to power on. Computer never turns on all the way however the meter shows it is getting 20v with the board in or out. \nHistory: Customer was doing a Ventura security update (not sonoma), and the computer powered off, and the customer was never able to get it powered back on. The boards looks in great shape, nothing appears damaged. \nCurrent issue: I cannot get the computer to go in to DFU mode going the normal way of using the keyboard. I have been successful with forcing DFU but then trying to do a revive or restore, I get the \"Gave up waiting for device to transistion from DFU state to DFU state.\" With the 4042 error at the end. Logiwik shows this is a timeout error waiting on the SSD. \nI checked out the voltages going to the SSD and they all seem present, however I am not certain how to tell if we have a SSD problem, or something else?"
