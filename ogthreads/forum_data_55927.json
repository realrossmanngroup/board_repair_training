            "message": "Hello everyone! I have a 820-00928 board that is not displaying image to the internal display. This board had some minor liquid damage near U3200 and was originally only giving me 5v on the charger. I replaced U3200 with a new CD3215 chip and the board now gives me 20v and boots to the OS, but only displays image to an external display. I have read most of the posts here about the A1707's with no display and have already tried to replace U9850 3 times and the screen is still black. No image or backlight shows up on the screen but all the screen voltages seem to be present. External display is working fine using usb-c to HDMI adapter so not sure where to look next. The LCD connector on the board looks perfect also. Any help would be appreciated. Here are some voltage measurements I took while the board was connected to my know good test screen only.\n\nPP5V_S0SW_LCD - 5.1\nPP3V3_S0SW_LCD - 3.3\nEDP_PANEL_PWR_EN - 3.3\nPANEL_FET_EN_DLY - 3.4\nDFR_DISP_PWR_EN - 3.4\nBUF_EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN - 3.4\nBUF_SMC_REST_L - 3.4\nDFR_DISP_SMC_RST_L - 3.4\nSMC_RESET_L - 3.4\nDP_INT_HPD - 3.3"
