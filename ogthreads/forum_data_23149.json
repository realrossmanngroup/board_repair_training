            "message": "Hi Guys,\n\nI just got a board in, no light on the charger, still need to test everything. Customer said it had been repaired in Cambodia before as it didn't run on the battery. Now my question is, I noticed R7051 and R7052 pin 2 where both soldered together. Any reason why the other shop would have done this? Desoldering didnt make the Mac work, I guess I need to start with Onewire:).\n\nMy question is, is there any reason for soldering these resistors together, as it seems it was done on purpose, it was a nice solder bridge. \n\nThanks"
