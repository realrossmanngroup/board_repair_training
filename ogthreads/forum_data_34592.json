It was for a friend so i tools quick look, checked for obvious shorts, cleaned it up and sent t back. He reported that the machine worked lie new.\n\nSince then the fan has started spinning at full revs and the charger light doesn't come on . But the device still powers up and still charges the battery. Apple diagnostics reports ppp002 and 007 (charger not found).  \n\nNothing obviously burned out on the board.  I will utrasound it in case there is crud under the smc.  But none of that feels right.  \n\nAny clues?\n\nTried SMC reset a few times to no avail. Likewise unplugging battery.  \n\nThanks in advance as always .\n\nJustin"
