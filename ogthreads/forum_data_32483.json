            "message": "Hi I have a Macbook Pro 15\" 2012 Retina 820-3332-A.  It will boot from usb and thunderbolt and work perfectly but the internal PCIE drive just boot loops.  I've tested the PCIE drive on another Mac and it works perfectly.  I'm guessing the issue has to do with some data lines going to the Storage but before I start I'm hoping for some direction or if someone has readings for the data lines.  Or if someone has ran into this before.  Thx."
