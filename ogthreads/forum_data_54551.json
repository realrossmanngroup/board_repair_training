Upto pp5v_s5 and pp3v3_s5 stable.Other than all power rails including Vcore is pulsing for a second.fan does not spin at all. \npp5v_s0 also pulsing come around 2.3v and 0v.\n\nWhat can see TP[01] SPI_MOSI TEST POINT IS BURNT.\nBut the connectivity from R6112 pin 2 to R6127 and R6122 is there. voltages 3.3v\n\nChecked the bios area all resistors acurate. Any idea ?"
