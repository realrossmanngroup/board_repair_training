            "message": "I know Toshiba is off topic, but may be someone has encountered this issue before and can help, or have any kind of insight!\nBoard with fan and heat sink and CPU compound, powered with 90W charger / 19V, will boot (fan spin) without RAM inserted in any of the slots. \nWill quarter spin when a stick of RAM is inserted. When fan spins, power button turns on. When fan stops, power button is off too.\nIf I pull the stick of RAM while it is quarter spinning, it will boot. If I insert the stick of RAM while fan is spinning, it stays on.\nBut computer does not boot with RAM inserted.\nAny insight would be awesome!\nP.S.: working blind without schematics, I found 3 parallel inductors with 1.05V, 1.35V, and 1.5V which all seem to match with CPU-GPU-RAM-PCH voltages. So those seem to be produced.\nCPU is removable but customer said they isolated issue to main board.\nCPU immediately gets warm, almost hot when I connect to power. Not sure if this kind of temp is normal or not. This is my first attempt at PC board repair."
