            "message": "Hi, I have another 820-3437 with liquid spill around the SMC. After cleaning the PPBUS went from 8.16 to 8.56v. Orange and green light present. Fan starts to spin, stops after 10-15 seconds and then starts again and keeps spinning. I have 3.3v on both U1900 and U6100. 25 and 36mhz coming from the clock chip, CPU gets hot but still not booting. Also have a mouse lighting up on USB. Thoughts?"
