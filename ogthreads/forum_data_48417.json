Magsafe has light.\n\n\nNow have this reails:\n\nPPBUS is ok\n\nALL S5 and S4 reails are ok, except PP3V3_SUS and PP5V_S4RS3 ( It's generated from U8050 that doesnt recieve SMC_SENSOR_PWR_EN, it's just pulsing from 0 to 3.4 every 2-3 seconds.V)\n\nDo you think it's SMC ?\n\n\nP.S: SOrry. PP3V3_SUS is present and all sys pwr is pulsing every 2-3 seconds.\n\nAlready checked u1900 again and it seems be ok.\n\nAlso checked SMC bypass and fan spins for half second and stops."
