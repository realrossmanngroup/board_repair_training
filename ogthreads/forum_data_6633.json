            "message": "I have macbook board 820-00138-A somebody try to do something on it has no physical damage no water damage. I measured for all rails everything is present i have fan spin but no chime no image but i have vcore. there is no power on the USB ports going. The only strange thing i've noticed is when i plug the charger take like 5 seconds for fan to spin just a little and gonna stop so the fans gonna start shaking on off on off for few seconds and after they start spinning for 30 seconds stop again and start again after the fans are working fine. I have no idea where to start I have voltage on all rails. Any ideas ???"
