            "message": "Its a water damaged board, damage was mostly around vcore coils and u6100, cleaned everything and board boots up but there is no image or backlight on screen, there is usb activity when i connect external device and cpu also gets warm.\n\nVcore starts from .9 volts and then drops to .6 volts after few seconds.\nBacklight_en -0v\npp5v_s0sw_lcd - 0v\nPp3v3_s0sw -0v\nEdp_panel_pwr_en -0v\n\nCan it be the cpu? I saw in Louis's video that backlight line and edp_int_aux_n are next to each other, and a slight spike from backlight line to edp_int_aux can fry that part of cpu.\nis there anything else i can check before declaring it dead?"
