            "message": "Hi, Sold a 2850 board customer broke a ton of things installing it.  We got it back and am attempting to repair the broken connections. The WiFi Connection was torn off on the front side all copper pads are missing. I Ran 4 wires that are under the chip and the rest of the connections in the front but im getting no WiFi Hardware to show up.  What im wondering is if my Attempted WiFi repair is not sufficient or if there may have been something along the line Fried. I went a head and monkeyed the thing by just replacing every wifi connection around it and on the backside as it was faster than testing everything."
