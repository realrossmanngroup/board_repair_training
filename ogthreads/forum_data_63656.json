            "message": "Hello\n\nThis one has arrived with a complaint of intermittent shutdowns and the battery occasionally not holding power, with no signs of corrosion or prior work.\n\nEverything works fine however I observed the following symptoms (all tested without battery)\n- Continuous full fan spin\n- When I get into diagnostic mode, it reports:\n  1. There may be an issue with the SMC, reference: PFM006\n  2. There may be an issue with the power management system, reference: PPN001, additional reference VFF001\n\nI am a bit unsure where to start as the laptop comes up fine with no obvious issues other than above. Thermal sensor comes to mind, but not sure any of the above errors are related."
