            "message": "820-3437-b Board came with prior liquid damage few months ago, fixed at the time.\nCustomer came few days ago with not booting macbook air, i checked and noticed that there is no 5V S3 and 5v S0 also.\n5v S5 present.\n\nWas poking around and applied heat to SMC around 200c for diagnostic purpose. Mac started up, worked for 10-15 min, after cooling off same issue, so i decided to reball SMC, did it, macbook worked that evening, passed tests. In the morning i came and before calling customer decided to check it, and it is not coming on with same symptoms.\nSo i reballed SMC again thinking i did not good job on reballin. Same thing happened, worked same day, next day does not boot with same symptoms. \nWhat could be the issue?\nMany thanks in advance."
