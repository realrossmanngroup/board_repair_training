I have taken the connector of an old A1278 fan but I can't tell which pin goes where.\nI have tried some different places now an got the fan to spin but I don't know if tach and controller pins are correct.\nThe fan spins high all the time now. The hard drive is also missing one of the thermal sensors (the one not connected to the SATA plug). I know this could be the fan issue as well as I have only taken a sensor from an old iMac to try. Can I replace the sensor with a resistor for testing?\n\nI know I could just buy a new fan and thermal sensor but I would like to verify that everything works before ordering."
