            "message": "The computer stopped charging properly after I start using Oracle Virtual Box with heavy configuration, I guess something somewhere overheated. Initially the problem was that the battery was not charging even though the mac works fine using the charger only, without the battery. Since the status of the battery was \"replace soon\", I purchased a new one. The new one was not charging as well, so I guess the problem is in the board. I took the mac to a \"friend\" who works with iphones only, but  he said he \"could handle this problem\", well he didn't, and worse, after I pick it up and turn it on it was not even recognising the battery anymore and the battery status is not in the menu bar anymore (If I check the box to show it it unchecks itself). He must've added another problem trying to fix the problem, since he was nervous when he handed it back and didn't charge anything. I know some basics electronics and have a multimeter so I would like to understand what is causing this. Could you please point me to possible faulty components that could cause this (e.g check R7005 and so on)? Many thanks."

Since the store who sold me the battery ask me to send it back, I sent it  to them a few days ago. But I doubt it was a faulty one.\n\nR7050 looks good when tested with multimeter on diode mode."
