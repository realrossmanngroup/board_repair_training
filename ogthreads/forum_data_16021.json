Perhaps my multi meter is a bit crap? Works for everything else though.... Will see if I can borrow a more expensive one to test that theory before shelling out on a more expensive one.\n\nJust need to tidy up the wire and all the other bits and pieces I have touched and then need to decide what ultrasonic to buy over here in the UK.
