R7051 measured around 3.0 ohm (however between the 2 pole or any 2 screws the multimeter read 0.9ohm, assuming this is internal resistance between the 2 pole). I guess subtracting that from 3.0 will give 2.1 ohm which means R7051 is probably OK.\n\nI measured R7050 and it is also 0.9 ohm. again subtracting the internal resistance should be 0 ohm, which also means R7050 is ok.\n\nThis implies R7052 is messed up?"
