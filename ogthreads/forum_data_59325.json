When i attempt the recovery process, the progress bar for the internet download starts to jump about. Also, the fan is running very high after about a minuter or 3 of the unit being powered on.\n\nAHT result says there's an issue with the SMC, suspecting either due to the high fan reading or the smc itself. Any suggestions as to where to start on this one."
