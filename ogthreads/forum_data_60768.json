Found that a trace was missing from R7052 (2) to R7050 (4) so I put a jumper in it, did that, but still not turning on, when I turn it on with my PSU sometimes I get PPBUS_G3H at 12.6v  @.020A and sometimes I get PPBUS_G3H at 4.99V @.080A. Have replaced U7000, same behavior.\nThere is a weird thing, on U7200 pin 6, I get .850v and I think I am supposed to get 3.3v there am I right? Anyway, when the board is at .080A there is no pp3v3_s5. but when it is at .020A I do get the pp3v3_s5 line.\nU7941\nPIN 1-3 = 3.3V\nPIN 4 = 0V\nPIN 5 = 0V\nPIN 6 = 3.3V\nPIN 7 = 0V\nPIN 8 = 3.3V\n\nANOTHER WEIRD THING, WHEN I TURN OFF MY PSU IF I MEASURE PIN 2 OF F7040 VOLTAGE IS NOT 0V IT IS AROUND 3V AND DROPPING..."
