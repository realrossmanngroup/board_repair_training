So I need the correct Logic Board number    One online source said that from my serial number of the computer ([B]C2QLM04AFKYP with 1.3 Intel 5 with 4 G)[/B] that correct logic board was 820-000164 and another suggested it was 661-7476. I need that to know which IO board to order. Or perhaps I need a new Logic Board. The computer now has no working USB ports and while it will boot up with the \"replacement\" IO board I bought off Ebay, it only holds 1% charge, no orange/green light. If those symptoms suggest a bad logic board Ill just opt to upgrade to a 13\" MacPro A1502 that Louis recommended in his reviews."

Battery is a component that degrades over time so it'll last less and less time and at one point it'll stop working entirely.\nSo saying \"The original IO board wont hold any charge at all.\" is a bit weird and doesn't really describe the original symptoms.\n\nPossible symptoms include no green light on the Magsafe, not turning on at all, not turning on from battery, not turning on from Magsafe, turning on from Magsafe or battery but not charging the battery, etc\u2026\n\nAlso state the model number on the original Left I/O board and the new Left I/O board. It's written on it somewhere. If you can't find it (it's written on it somewhere), send pictures of both.\nMain logic board model number is also written on the main logic board\u2026 maybe above CPU."

For months, I've had to wiggle or hold the plug from the MagSage in a certain way to finally see an orange light then gently let go of the plug to maintain the light.   Now I cannot get the plug into any position to gain any orange light.  I ordered a new MagSafe charger AND a used IO board from Ebay (which was the wrong board apparently since I cant get my Mic ribbon cable to fit into the replacement IO boards receptor - my cable is slightly too wide).   But even with the Mic left unplugged, it will only get to a max 1% charge. and now the USB port is nonfunctional.   Thanks"

They should also be helpful to make sure you get the right product for your machine.\n\nAlso inspect the DC-in flex connector on the logic board to make sure it's not damaged."
