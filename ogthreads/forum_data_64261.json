But I would suspect it being higher than a steady .3V. If the multimeter would not be capable of measuring this I would have used my CRT.  My plan was to lift the one pin off the coil and put it at an angle (on the MCP side) so that I can measure the voltage from U7750 after the coil with no load attached to it that could pull it down. I will check C7770 tomorrow and report back. As I don\u2019t have the schematic with me right now I can\u2019t tell for sure but I probably did already check and maybe replace it.
