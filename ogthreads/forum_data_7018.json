You can not enter that state S3 is turned off, touch again let sustained 6 seconds to turn power button.\n3. THE ASD brings me 9 errors. These can cause the above problems?\nAnnex photos of the reports of ASD. Thank you."

I extracted the C5025 and the shorte disappeared, so the MacBook Pro turned on. I did the ADS and the error sensors desappeared, it's all OK. Then, the machine was turned on and working, but 20 minutes later the computer turned off, just by itself. Now i have green light on the magsafe AC,  but it doesn't turn on. The voltage is missing in U6100 pin 3 and 8 =PP3V3_SUS_ROM .  When i try to turn it on, the fan has a little little movement but the machine doesn't turn on."
