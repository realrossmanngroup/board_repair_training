            "message": "Hello. I got a 820-00840 that was liquid damaged and both usb ports would give me 0v when connecting a charger. Had to replace both CD3215 chips and some caps and resistors around them to restore 20v and the board boots. Everything was working fine including the power button, so I sold the laptop to someone. 3 weeks later, it was returned to me because they could not get it to turn on. When I tested it, it would only turn on when you connect a charger to it. It does not automatically turn on when you open the lid or when you press the power button. Also, when the computer is on, I cannot turn it off using the power button at all. I have to do SMC reset to get it to turn off. I tested the board alone with just a charger connected and tried to trigger SMC_ONOFF_L, and PM_PWRBTN_L stays at 3.3v and the board does not turn off. I also tried to trigger PM_PWRBTN_L and SMC_ONOFF_L also stays at 3.3v and the board does not turn off. I am thinking there is an issue with the SMC but wanted to confirm first before changing it."

I did not see any corrosion near the SMC but decided to pull the SMC and reball it anyway. After re-balling the SMC, I now only get 20v 0.03a for some reason. PP3V3_G3H is 3.3v and PPBUS_G3H is 13v, but all the other rails seem to be pulsing. I think I will try and replace the SMC with a new one tomorrow, unless you suggest checking something else."

I took another look at the board and noticed a solder ball that bridged 2 capacitors together and bridged PP1V8_S0 with SPKRAMP_5V_3. I fixed this and now I am back where I started. The board boots again but the power button still does not work to turn the computer on/off. SMC_ONOFF_L, PM_PWRBTN_L and PLT_RST_L are all 3.3v. I soldered a wire to SMC_ONOFF_L and tried touching it to ground and holding for a few seconds, and the board stays on still, so it does not seem like an issue with the power button itself."
