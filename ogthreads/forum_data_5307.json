I don't know what to measure. \nGot a 820-3462 board with not a sceric of water damage to be found under the microscope. \nLaptop works fine on cord but battery is always showing an X. \nTried a new battery and a working second hand battery. Same prob. \nPower rails exist obviously because it turns on. So SMC? How do I tell if this problem is the SMC or not?\nPretty confused on this one. \nThanks."

It's one of the screws holding the battery to the board, and if not present nothing with the battery will work, it is not magnetic, so everyone loses it."
