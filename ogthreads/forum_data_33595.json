            "message": "Hi everyone, working on this 820-2849 board. Its been driving me mad for the long time and i cant figure it out so decided to ask you guys some help. its been a pain and i know that it might be a dead video but i believe i can still fix it. Right so the problem is that macbooks starts as it should, chimes ok, but theres no backlight or video.i have checked all power rails and all power rails are pretty much ok. GPU vcore and cpuvcore both present. i have noticed that PPVCORE_S0_CPU starts with 1.05v with fans spinning but after fans starts to spin faster voltage drops to 0.89v . is it normal or needs to be investigated? Also came accross that GFXIMVP_ISNS_IOUT=SMC_GFX_ISENSE only 0.01V. anyway any suggestions where to start? ppbus_S0_LCDBKLT_FUSED power stops at Q9806 pin4. 0V pin 1.2.5.6. LCD_BKLT_EN -0V. \nL9000 - 0V both sides. LCD_PWR_EN 0.01V .Changed u9000 no change. really desperate for some help or where to start."

Other required pulldowns has power but R9693 missing as well. Also checked  Q9607 and pin2 ALL SYS PWRGD has power, R9676 pin1 has power but pin 2-0V. could you explain how it works? as far as i can understand when all sys pwrgd powers the gate it opens and lets GMUX_S3_PD_EN open the gate right? but now pin 6 and 5 0V\nR9678 has power pin2 but 0V pin1 so LCD_pwr_en is 0V somehow. really struggling to understand why as pin 2 of R9678 is GMUX_S3_PD_GND so should be 0v i guess but now pin2 of R9678=2.64V, pin1=0V"
