            "message": "Hi, this one drives me crazy... No previous history, no signs of spillage, dust etc. (MLB looks like factory new). It does boost on all 4 ports to 20V, switches on to 180mA, drops down to 20-30mA and switches back on to 180mA then stays at this level. No PPVCC_S0_CPU although ALL_SYS_PWRGD signal is present on pin 48 of ISL (3.3V level). All other coils have the correct voltages (comparing to the table of measurements taken from working MLB). PPVCC_S0_CPU resistance to ground = 6 Ohm, no short circuit on any surrounding capacitor. Replaced ISL95828 controller and both SIC635 switches, no luck. What to do next?\n\nEDIT 1: Checked with an oscilloscope and no single pulse at primary side of CPU coils when the MLB takes 180mA and ALL_SYS_PWRGD signal goes up."
