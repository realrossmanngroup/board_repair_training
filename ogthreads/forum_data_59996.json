Device had battery changed by another tech and now will not power up. Below are the voltage measurements. PM_SLP_S4_L = 0 which I think is due to PM_RSMRST_L being at 61mv. R7810 resistance measures fine and did not find anything out of the ordinary with diode mode. Tracing back on the schematics I think the issue could be with U7800 but wanted some expert advice on where I might go next to validate. I do not have an Oscope to check clock signals. Thanks in advance.\n\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3.09\nPCH_SRTCRST_L = 3.07\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.34\nPM_DSW_PWRGD = 3.35\nPP3V3_SUS = 3.34\nPM_BATLOW_L = 3.32\nPM_RSMRST_L = 61mv\nPM_PWRBTN_L = 3.34\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0"
