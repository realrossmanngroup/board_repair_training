Just keeps turning itself back on.\nThere is no OS installed. \nI try to run Apple diagnostics and it wants to connect to the internet, I type in the wifi password and it never connects, just spins.\nThe mouse and keyboard are slow/choppy. The fan does not spin fast, it does not spin up at all but from what I can remember, the fan would spin up after being turned on for a while. \nBattery seems fine as I unplug the charger and the computer stays on.\nKeyboard light is coming on. \nI tried getting the computer in to DFU mode via the keyboard method and no success. (Not sure how to place in DFU mode without keyboard).\nI am assuming this is a sensor issue but I have no clue where to look to be able to tell?"

I ended up replacing the entire J6700 connector from a donor board. While doing so, I noticed pin 14 \"I2C_KBD_SDA\" the pad was damaged. Not sure if I did that or if it was like that the entire time. Anyhow I repaired the pad with a slug.
