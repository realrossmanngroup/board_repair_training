            "message": "This board came in for no power; PPBUS was shorted, inject 1V and took off the bad cap, which was C7324.. now PPBUS is clear of short. \nBut the board is still not powering on; after visual inspection I found out that had corrosion on pin #2 and #3.. I replaced the chip and the board is still refusing to power on.. \nAlthough the symptoms are different where I get a fan spin.. then stop.. then a continuous fan spin.. if I unplug and replug.. I get no fan whatsoever.. \n\nWhen then fan spins I get PP1V05_S0.. Any clue on where to look?"

PPBUS or 3v3_S4 or anything the fan spins..\nSo I took the diode mode readings of all power rails and it all seems to fit with 1. FlexBV (although my readings were higher in all readings I guess that's for the multimeter differences) and 2. another board that I have.\n\nWhat was a bit suspicious to PP1V05_S0 so I replaced U8005; same issue\nalso PP1V05S0_DRVH_R was kinda weird going up then down.. I replaced both U7600 and Q7630; same issue\n\nDunno what's wrong with this board.. it was supposed to be a clean easy job of PPBUS_G3H; take it off and boom happy A1466..."
