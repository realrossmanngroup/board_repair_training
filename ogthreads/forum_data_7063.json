I do not have schematics for this one, but I have tried to google if this is a common issue.\nIt seems like there is a lot of these displays with similar symptoms which leaves me thinking there may be some weak components in these displays.\nI know the power supply is good and outputs 24V as it should."

The EEPROM was bad and either U101 or 102 and also U303.\nSo check for power on both of those coils and check resistance on power on of both EEPROMs. Also check CPU power bus on C206/208/211.\nYou can also see a LED to the right of the CPU, it should come on.\nDisconnect inverter to rule that out, I have had those die too."
