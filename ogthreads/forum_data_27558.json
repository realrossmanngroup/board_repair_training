            "message": "So c6100 was corroded and kinda fell off the board, that is around u6100, the board doesnt look bad, always starts up with chima, it will start to boot, and the line under the apple logo just about to finish, than it powers off, in boot menu holding option key is the same, new battery and new SSD with installed osx,s still the same. Now i think it will be the u6100 bios chip, we have 2 donor boards, one of them have a good loking u6100, but atm i dont have the programmer, do i start that way? to remove u6100, read it out and program the bios chip, or if the bios chip is damaged it would not even try to boot?"
