I only had this happen once while I was swapping around parts turning it off and on.\n\nWondering if anyone has any ideas?\n\nThanks"

While on the phone call, I hit the power button to turn off the unit and hit the power button to turn it on and well, it booted. The unit will never boot if I just connect the power cord, I have to turn it off via the power button and turn it back on. I also noticed, if I connect the other fan back, it will not boot anymore. So I turned off the unit to deal with it this morning and I was able to figure out a process to make it boot which is.\n\n- Disconnect one fan\n- Connect power cable so the unit powers on\n- Let run like that for 2 minutes (the heat sink is pretty hot now)\n- Press the power button to turn it off\n- Press the power button to turn it on\nNow it boots.\n\nI know it's not healthy in letting it cook like that but it doesn't matter if the unit doesn't come back to life as it's not a customers device.\n\nSo I am assuming something on the board needs to get up to temp before it works which in turn tells me the board is trash possibly.\n\n\nAnyhow, for giggles, I did swap the cap \n- No change\n\nVCORE was the same as well after the cap change, in fact, nothing changed at all with the unit.\n\nThoughts?"
