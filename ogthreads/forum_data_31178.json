            "message": "Replaced a screen on macbook air 11 inch 2012. Unfortunately had an accident with fan screw holder on the motherboard. (Very lame of me, I know!). Now macbook doesnt start from battery or hold charge. Starts with adapter plugged in. Shows battery percentage. Battery percentage goes up. As soon as disconnect magsafe, switches off.\nDid NVRAM and CMS reset. Getting 8V on pins 1,2,3 of J6950 battery connector.\nWhat did I fuck up now?\n\nThanks!"
