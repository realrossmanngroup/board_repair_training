Customer brought it in because it would not turn on after it went black randomly while browsing.\n\nPlugged in charger and it was giving 20v @ 0 amps. I found a short on PPBUS_G3H. Fixed it by replacing U7430. No more short, PPBUS_G3H = 13 volts, MacBook now turns on, makes charge connection sound, but no backlight (I can see faint Apple logo and it would boot / go to recovery assistant).\n\nThere is no sign of liquid.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 13 volts (12.3 - 12.5 volts if battery is connected)\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT = 55 volts"
