            "message": "I have a 820-3115-b board here with spillage damage isl6259 was damaged as were the two tracks to pins 17 and 18. I have repaired these and checked all current sensors the only issue I could find was there is no continuity between R7050 and R7052 I have tried cleaning the via but am unable to find anything rigid and thing enough to fit throug it so I have ran a Jumper between the 2. The charger just stays green. Q7005 has 12.27v on pins 1-3 pin 4 has 12.24, pins 5-8 have .6v \nReadings on the battery connector are  7-9  are .6v. \n6 is 3.4\n5 is 0v\n4 is 3.4\nAny pointers welcome"
