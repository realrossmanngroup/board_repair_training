Corrosion was around the PP3V42_G3H area and the J6950 jack. \nTested with known good battery.\n[LIST]\n[*]R5380 and R5380 both have 2k.\n[*]SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL\n[LIST]\n[*]2,48V - 3,5V (2,48V is the baseline. Pulses are getting up to 3,5V)\n[*]0.5440V diode-mode\n[/LIST]\n[*]SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA\n[LIST]\n[*]0-3,42V (looks like normal communication)\n[*]0.5400V diode-mode\n[/LIST]\n[/LIST]\nThe SMC does not seem to short the SCL line to GND. It increases the voltage. Any ideas before I have to take a deeper look at the SMC?\n\nThanks for your help. Nice to be here! :D"
