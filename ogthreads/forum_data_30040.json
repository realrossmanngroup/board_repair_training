            "message": "This board had a very small unique spot of water on bottom side near audio chip. \nThe rest of the board is intact, I replaced keyboard because some keys were not working anymore.\n\nLaptop works perfectly but with EFI I have IPBR over high limit error when only battery.\n\nWhen battery +charger plugged in I have no errors when I run EFI.\n\nI inspected ISL area with sensing resistors on pins 17-18 (4.6ohms) and 27-28 (20,8ohms) and R5429 300kohms.\n\nIPBR value reported is 1.984A. Normal range should be [0.0-1.5]A.\n\nExcept a bad battery I don't see anything else that may cause this error. I went over one complete charging discharging cycle and it holds charge a good 6 hours with full screen video and apps running, nothing heating.\n\nAny advice beside trying antother battery tomorrow?"

It could of course be that the system is really pulling that much current, but I doubt that as the battery would not last 6 hours. \nCould be a bad ISL or crap under the SMC pulling up the BMON line. Crap under SMC is my first suspect."
