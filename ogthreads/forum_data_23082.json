            "message": "Got a 13\" Retina board that had liquid damage 8 months ago the client said and now has a flashing folder. Tried a tester SSD and still got the flashing folder. After looking around the board some I see signs of corrosion that tells the story that most likely the PP3V3_S0 pin on the speaker connector shorted out the whole rail as there is power to the SSD Switch for 3v3_S5 but no 3v3_S0. Is there a good place to start looking, currently I'm just going by testing nasty looking components on the rail."
