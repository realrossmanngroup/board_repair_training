When I plug it in I got 12V for a moment, slowly dropping to 0.4V.\nI got a green light on the charger, PP3V42_G3H is stable.\nCHGR_DCIN is okay\nCHGR_RST_L is okay.\nCurrent sening seems okay.\nI already replaced U7100 and Q7130 and removed F7140 with the same result.\n\nThank you for your help.\nDudi"
