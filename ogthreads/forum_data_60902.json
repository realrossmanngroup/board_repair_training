Some components are missing, dirty, CD3215 overheated etc. No voltage on USB-C meter at all\n\nWhat is done for now:\nReplaced all 4 CD3215\nReplaced U7000\nSoldered back missing U8000 and U7960\nSoldered back missing Q7040 and Q7030\n\nNow got back 20 volts, but 0 amps\nPPDCIN_G3H 20 volts, stable\nPPBUS_G3H 0.6-0.9 volts. No short\nR7020 is ok, 0 ohm, 20 volts\nR7021, R7022, R7061 and R7062 is 1 Ohm as it should be\nU7000, Q7030 and 7040 as i said is already changed\n\nIs it something else can pull the line to the groung, or u7000 still doesn't work properly by some reason?"
