I wonder if some of the other lines are pulling it down?\n\nWhen unsoldered in this order:\nR8166 - P1V8S3_PGOOD - 0.7V\nR8165 - P5VS3RS3 - 0.7V\nR8164 - P1V05S0 - 0.9V\nR8168 - When I removed this one too and no other _PGOOD resistors left apart than R8167,  I have jumping 3.3V on ALL_SYS_PWRGD on 5 sec low / 1 sec high interval.\n\nIs that expected?"
