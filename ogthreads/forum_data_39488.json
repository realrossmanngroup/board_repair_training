            "message": "Hi guys\n\nI got this 4924. It came in with no chime and no sound and no audio devices shown in audio settings. No liquid. Just stopped working one day.\n\nI opened it up and the Cirrus audio chip got a hole burned in it. So I just replaced it. This brought the sound back but at low volume. I made a PRAM reset and the chime is also lower volume than normally. And also the quality of sound is not perfect when playing music.\n\nCirrus chip was taken from a junk board and reballed. Is something wrong here or could it be something else??\n\nThanks"
