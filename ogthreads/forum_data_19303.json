Would love a bit of help.\n\nIt only had small signs of corrosion around 1 of the USB controllers. \nCleaned off thinking 'probably going to be all good after an ultrasonic' \n\nits not, i cant seem to find any power at any part of the board. Im using an 87w USB C apple charger thats brand new (tested on a a1534 macbook and charges it fine)\n\nI found a small inductor with very low resistance to ground 2ohm's. It doesnt look to be part of a high amperage circuit. \nIf anyone has one of these boards could they measure the power to the inductor and its resistance to ground? \n\nWill attach pictures in the next post.\nThanks"

            "message": "Yeah. thats what i thought, and it would make sense that i cant get any power anywhere without pp3v42 (or whatever variation these use.) i injected 1v into it but because its 2ohm and not 0ohm it doesn't pull enough current at 1v to heat anything. \n\nI lifted the inductor and checked both pads for resistance, 30k on one side and 2ohm on the other, Im thinking of injecting about 3v3 but dont have the confidence as its a customers and im assuming they have important data on it. Dont wanna start injecting higher power into it and risk damage.\n\nI could try using hot air to pinpoint it. Even if i do i doubt it will be a component i will be able to get hold of. These newer systems are killing me."
