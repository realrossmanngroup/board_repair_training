Here in the bench, it was working, playing videos from youtube for 2 days strait, and when I shut it down, it didn't' power on again.\n\nAfter a while, it powered on again, and after a while it stoped playing image. I rebooted a few times, and always had a chime, but no USB activity.\n\nI removed the board from the chassis, and it worked normaly for a few times on the bench, and now it powers on but is on the diagnostics menu.\n\nAny idea? Can you help?"
