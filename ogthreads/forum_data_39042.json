Thank you for any tips. \n\nI have done SMC bypass mode and I actually get a chime, I just don't get any image whatsoever. Not sure about the mechanics of it. Vcore at 1.3 is present in SMC bypass but not present in normal boot. \n\n\n\nPerhaps it needs a new SMC or a reflow"

Now with that backlight fixed we are good. \n\nI injected power into S0 backlight and was able to see 1 amp drawn with just 2v at one capacitor on the back of the board. I guess I'll replace it now. :D"

When I got it to start smc bypass it would have been present probably.\nSo it never was booting because of the \u201cno battery\u201d but then with backlight I can see that and it boots fine.\n\nshould I repeal and replace this 2.2uF 100v capacitor? It seems redundant. There are about 20 others on the circuit and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s super necessary. I took it off, but I\u2019m not sure if I can find one in my old MacBook Pro donors\n\nEDIT: found a nice big 2.2uF cap on an old MacBook Pro. It is big, but it works."
