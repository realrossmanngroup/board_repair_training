I was unable to test the computers functionality before I returned it because I saw corrosion on the trackpad cable and the trackpad was not working. I told the customer to replace the cable and trackpad and they said they but the keyboard and track pad are not working. I looked at the cable and everything and it looks ok. Do I need to just do an SMC reset or something? or are there bigger issues?"
