            "message": "I have two A1502 came in today, identical machines with 820-3476 boards.\n\n\nproblems are the same, machine can power on, chime , back light will be on (after it chimes and wait like 20 seconds later). sometimes no back light but still chime.\n\nif it has back light, then that's it, no flashing folder, or apple logo, just black screen with back light ( just like usually we see it boots up but no apple in the middle)\n\nremove SSDs, and tried other screen tops , still same story.this problem is pretty similar to the 820-3332 board with the soldering problem of U8900\n( Which Duke figured out and let me say that was absolutely brilliant !! )\n\nso tried to compare that with this board, but pretty much have no clue, maybe not related. anyone seen similar stuffs?"

I also notice something, when back light is not present, what's missing to boost the circuit is the BKLT_EN_R\nwhich comes from U8330.\nthen what's missing for u8330 to output BKLT_EN_R is EDP_BKLT_EN (0v? close to) ,which comes from the CPU.....\n\nnot sure if Im thinking the right way though"
