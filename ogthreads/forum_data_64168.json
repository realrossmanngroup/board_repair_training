            "message": "Hello,\n\nI'm working on a A1990 that does not turn on anymore. Charger is stuck at 5.19V (stable) on each of the 4 USB-C ports, power stays at 0.036A (+/-0.002A).\n\nWith the battery plugged in, logic board not taken out, I measured:\n3.37V on the testpad PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X\n7.59V to 12.27 on the PPBUS_G3H, unstable.\n\nWith the battery unplugged, logic board not taken out, I measured:\n40 to 160mV on the testpad PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X\n20mV for PPBUS_G3H measured on R3451, pin2\n17mV for PPBUS_G3H measured on C3503, pin1\nThen I checked CHGR_EN_MVR on R6968, pin1 and pin2. It reads a 200 to 400mV, fluctuating a lot. Might peaks very briefly at 1.x V, unless it's due to the autorange of the multimeter\n\nThere is no short on PPBUS_G3H; red probe on pin1 of C3503, black probe on a screw shows 0.7 MOhm\n\nGiven the ~20mV of CHGR_EN_MVR, the value of PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X is not a surprise.\n\nPage 68 shows ISL9240 should give CHGR_EN_MVR, which, on page 67, enables PP3V3_G3H_RTC_X, whose value should be 3.38V.\n\n\n\nCurrently taking the logic board out of the case to measure what the ISL9240 receives as inputs.\n\n\n\nBackground:\nThe defective logic board is in a MacBook that had its top case+keyboard+battery replaced at the Apple Store in May.\nThe logic board, in its current condition, could win a beauty contest.\n\n\nIs there any way to make sure that the ISL 9240 is the culprit at 100% ?\nI never had to unsolder such a chip so far. Wondering if I would be better off finding a rat lab to train myself before."

Thanks.\n\nEdit: CB304 is now out of the board,it looks like I perhaps broke it while trying to measure 1V1_LDO_BMC. Can't solder it back in place.\nI measured it, 1.12uF. If I can measure it, I don't understand why I can't put it back in place.\n\nEdit: I found a 820-1958 (MAcBook Air 2020) donor board, took the C2830, schematics shows 2.2uF, measured it, 0.3nF...going to pick them all one by one and test as I do not have any 2018 MacBook Pro donor board\nMight be luckier if I pick one on the same part of the circuitry xD\n\nEdit: C3206, 1.03uF, but 6.3V; C4423, 2.1uF, 4V\nLooks like I ripped off the pad of CB304, will scratch the surface to solder on the trace\n\nI replaced the CD3215;\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]UB300[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD][/TD]\n\n[TD]{}=TA[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP1V8_UPC_{}_LDOD[/TD]\n[TD]0.44V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP1V1_UPC_{}_LDO_BMC[/TD]\n[TD]0.455V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_UPC_{}_LDO[/TD]\n[TD]0.355V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP1V8_UPC_{}_LDOA[/TD]\n[TD]0.478V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]USBC_{}_CC1[/TD]\n[TD]0.542V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]USBC_{}_CC2[/TD]\n[TD]0.543V[/TD]\n[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n1V1_UPC_TA_LDO_BMC is now in line. But, I still have to solder back a new CB304\n\nI didn't succeed, but I plugged the power, and I still get [email]5.19V@0.03A[/email] on 1 port on each side, and [email]5V@0.36A[/email] on the other. That's less than before actually."
