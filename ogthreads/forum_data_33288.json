            "message": "Hello guys,\n\nI have here a troubled 820-3437 board. When plugging in the original adaptor, the fan would do a quarter spin. All G3H rails are good. It would go to S0 state for a split second and then drops.\n\nU8080:\n- PP5V_S4RS3 would go to 5V and then goes to 0\n- P5VS0_EN would also go to 5V and then goes to 0\n\nNo history of water damage, but a lot of dust near the edge of the board. Some points look dirty, but I do not think any are corroded (I could be wrong).\n\nAny advice?\n\nThanks"

If you are 1000% positive it is not liquid it could be a corrupt BIOS. You should see if there is any more history to this machine, a drop maybe, something plugged in and it died?"

            "message": "Thanks.\n\nI ultra-sonically cleaned it and when I first plugged in the adaptor, green/red light and no fan spin. Replugged it in and no more light. Sometimes if I leave the adaptor in it would go green/red after like 20-30 seconds which is odd. What could be the cause of this?\n\nI will test the traces in the U6100 and U1950 areas.\n\nEDIT: I lied. Green/red light is good now. I probably didn't leave it submerged in alcohol long enough after the ultra-sonic cleaning to get all the water out. But still no fan spin."
