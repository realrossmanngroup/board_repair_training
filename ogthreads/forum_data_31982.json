            "message": "I can't edit the title, but I got this board mixed up with another one (very similar). This is also an 820-3330 board.\n\nSymptoms:\n\n1. Board won't detect hard drive; doesn't show in EFI, and flashing folder appears.\n2. Drive gets power; I can hear the whine of the drive being powered, but no \"ticking\" (data). When I disconnect power, I can hear the typical click-off of drive.\n3. Pin 7 of U4510 is 3.3v\n4. C4510 and C4511 both look like they've seen significant heat/draw (not shorted, but darker-yellow on the end caps than others)\n5. Board boots to USB drive fine; WiFi, BT, Audio, etc., all work.\n6. Drive not detected in disk utility or System Info, of course.\n7. All resistors measure out fine around U4800/U4510, etc.\n\nSo I suspect some issue with the data connection. I replaced U4510, C4510 and C4511, but no dice. There are lots of data lines related to J4501, so unsure which others I should be looking at."

Also tried 3 other boards in the same casing and all work well/fine.\n\nCould it be a PCH issue? No liquid, but maybe a drop? I've seen a few dropped boards that had very particular/singular issues like this...most commonly, missing data/clock signals to LCD."

All checks out.\n\nI checked at C4517/18 pins 1 with an oscilloscope, and on a good board, it's a nice healthy signal. On this bad board, nothing (drive connected, etc). I might give up on this one, thinking maybe a PCH issue. If you have anything else I should check I will. Thanks so much for the help! This one kicked my ass."

However, maybe it was one of the rare moments some fuse was actually blown by a short circuit."
