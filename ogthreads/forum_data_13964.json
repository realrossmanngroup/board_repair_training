            "message": "Hello, i have a 3437 with Orange LED but no fan. It was liquid damaged with some spil near SMC as well as U6100. U6100 i replaced as well as some resistor around it. Here some measurements:\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.58\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.43\nPP5V_S5 = 5.02 \nPP5V_S4RS3 = 0\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.33\n\nAt U7501\nPin 12 SMC_PM_G2_EN = 3.41\nPin 21 P3V3S5_EN_R = 3.41\nPin 4 P5VS4RS3_EN_R = 0\nPin 23 VIN = 8.58\nR7551 = 0 ohm\n\nU6100\nR6101 = 95.9k\nR6102 = 3.28k\nPin 8 PP3V3_SUS = 0v\n\nAny suggestions based on those readings?"
