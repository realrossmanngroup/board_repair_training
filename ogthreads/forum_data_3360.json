I am waiting on the customer to give me the password so I can be sure the battery is charging. I've tried two batteries and both did the same thing.\n\nAs soon as I remove the charger the computer shuts off immediately.\n\nI watched Louis' video on this issue but that was on a Macbook Pro.\n\nWith the battery plugged in without the charger I checked PPVBAT_G3H_CONN and got around 0.075v. I don't know if it should be that low.\n\nI'm not sure where to check next."
