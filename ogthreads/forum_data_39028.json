            "message": "Whats up everyone, love you guys over at Rossman Repair Group, I have been working up the courage to start offering logic repairs to my customers (own a small repair shop) and your videos and knowledge have helped me work up to the point where I am actually doing some repairs, and have actually been successful in repairing a few, imagine that!\n\nAnyhow, it is great to be a part of this awesome community, and I can't wait to start helping people get their items fixed at a more affordable rate!\n\nSo here is what I got going on!  (Please bear with me as I still feel slightly stoopid with schematics and understanding how the board actually works, but I learn quick ;-)\n\nI've got a Macbook Pro 13\" Retina 820-4924 a1502 board with no backlight.\n\nThe LCD connector was partially melted off so I have already replaced that, hoping that would be it, but of course not.  \n\nFrom what I can tell there is NO PP5V_S0, which I believe based on the schematics that is what goes into the LED Driver and powers the Backlight Enable?\n\nThe Q7700 is not enabling if it has 12v on the LCDBKLT_EN pin is that correct?\nI am getting the 12v at the PPVIN_S0SW_LCDBKLT but it is not making it to r7742 which is the BKLT_EN Resistor.  Hope I am doing ok on this.\n\nI am not sure what to do, and the only other question I have is this, does this board need to be powered on with the keyboard or do I need to power it on with power pads in order for the backlight voltage to appear?? Because if so, I am not doing that, and only have the board plugged in alone without anything else while testing.  \n\nI have put the board back in the unit and it still displays an image, but still no backlight!\n\nI really appreciate what everyone does here and I spent about 5 hours yesterday trying to figure this out on my own, with videos/brdview software.  I just think I need a little more teaching before I can repair these in a respectable time limit, because I just cant spend this much time on a board haha..\n\nThanks for reading, and I eagerly await the knowledge!\n\nDavid Rainer\nComputer Booter"

            "message": "Just was watching Louis' video on his repair, and he found a short to ground off the bklt_en resistors, well I found one too at C8359 which is the IC2_BKLT_SCL line, I just removed it and the short is still there, so I guess that means I need to check the rest of those Capacitors in the line?? I am working on that, and I will also get the U8300 voltages right now.\n\n\"there is no pp5v_s0\"  I guess that means I am wrong about that statement, sorry about that.. still learning. but I know 5v is missing all around the backlit driver and bklt_en resistors... unless the screen needs to be plugged in to get those??  Will report back soon, thanks!"

I have ordered x2 LED Driver chips from your site, and I hope after replacing it things will be different haha, is there anything else I should check before receiving the new chip?? I do believe that the cap C8359 destroyed the LED driver as a similar cap in Louis' video did as well.\n\nI am still getting 12v on both pin 3/4 on U5450 which I understand means it is not switching over either?? Sorry I dont quite understand, but from what Louis said in the video, this should be 12v on pin 4, and about 5-6v on pin 3 in order for the backlight to operate, is that correct?\n\nI will replace the LED driver and test again. I love learning this and have learned a lot by watching the videos and am honestly amazed at the support and response you are giving to people... I appreciate it!\n\nDavid"

The 820-4924 backlight repair the Louis' did is practically the same as this one, and near the end of the video he finds out that the cap for BKLT_SDA had blown the donor LED Driver that he had installed, so after removing that cap, he replaces the LED Driver for the second time, and then he gets backlight.  So I will check the resistance to ground at pin 15 of the LED IC, which I am assuming will be almost 0 and then once I get the LED driver I will replace it!  Fun fun fun!"

She is going through her insurance to get it replaced but might still have it repaired, depending on insurance.  Thanks, and ill have another board that has missing Wifi and loud fans to repair here soon.  Second attempt at repairing it.  Ill start a new post"
