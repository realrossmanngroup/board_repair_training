I have no magsafe light at all.\nPP3V42_G3H = 3,41V,\nPPBUS_G3H, = 8,6V,\nSMC_BC_ACOK=3.3V, present at I/O board J9500 connector\nSYS_ONEWIRE=3,4V present at I/O board J9500 connector..\nISL6259 pins 17,18= 5ohms, 27,28=22ohms. DCIN 16V and ACIN (4.xV) present\n\nIt powers fine with charger only. it powers fine with battery only.\nIf I plug in magsafe while laptop is powered wtth battery I can see the charging logo but it actually doesn't charge, and the source is ac adapter.\n\nWhen I check battery status everything is normal, battery is seen and percentage ans estimated time is correctty reported, however in the system report for the magsafe I see nothing but:\nConnected: YES\nIdentifier: 0x0000\nRevision: 0x0000\nFamily: 0x0000\nSerial: 0x000000000\nCharging: No\n\nUsing only original magsafe and known good tested i/o board i/o cable and battery.\n\nAny idea??? Maybe a stupid thing I overlooked or an smc issue?\nThanks in advance"

            "message": "Thanks for the suggestion Gmorb. Yeah it was powering on both with only charger or only battery. But there was no syswire communication.\nIt's fixed, somebody had used brutal force on J9500, as sys_onewire pin was moving, same thing for SMC_BC_ACOK.  No corrosion at all, clean board...\nDidn't want to reflow smc because it's alive with proper voltage, and passes EFI...\nNow in system report I can see the magsafe charger well identified.\n\nThe odd thing is that I just lost backlight, maybe this board is finishing the avalanche failure now that magsafe light is restored:)\nIt was faint backlight then screen shut off. strange behaviour backlight going to 19-24V and then 8,6V.\nI will check that more in details."

What a total troll...\nNow I don't have audio, I mean it's not disabled, i see the audio speaker logo in the menu but no sound emitted. I am sure something still related to J9500. It's something inttermitent, because when I was diagnosing the no magsafe light I heard from time to time the chime, probably another bad pin. I will inspect thoroughly the pins and let you know."
