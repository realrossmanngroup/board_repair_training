            "message": "You cannot expect a power good signal, before corresponding power rail appears.\n\nU7100 requires more than a simple enable signal.\nIt is controlled through CPU_VID bus.\nSo there could be a problem with PCH/CPU, or even BIOS.\niGPU voltage (PPVCCGT_S0G) will not appear until high graphics load is detected, but CPU core voltage (PPVCCCPU_S0G) is of course required.\nMany blocks of CPU are already powered with other voltages and communication is necessary between some blocks of CPU and PCH, prior to generate core voltage.\n\nBe aware, liquid sign on the CPU power supply could mean letal damage.\nTry known good BIOS, clean ME."

I replaced it out of desperation.\nWill check now if it doesn't crashes after couple of minutes :)"
