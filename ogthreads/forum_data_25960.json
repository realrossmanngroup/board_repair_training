In the case of ASD which has a blue background, all I get is blue. Don't want to start blaming the GPU right away but in this case I also have no idea where I should begin to look.\n\nBefore the white or blue screen there is no weird pixelation or any indication the GPU is having an issue. Visual inspection showed a perfect board. On a bare system same issue."
