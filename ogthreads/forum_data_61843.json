            "message": "Hello everyone!\n\nHave this board, the story behind says that it felt down while hdmi was pluget and since then, no power. The board was first taking 0v on left side and 5v 0.3amp on the right side ports. After opening up and inspecting, i saw that on the left side usb c cable was actually not plugged in and the connector on motherboard was damaged and i presume it was damaged in previous shop and not by the impact it self (they screwed the metallic clamp on top still). I tried to fix the connector(it was a bit bend) and plugged it back, got 5v on this side as well.\n\nHowever i didn't like how the connector was looking i removed in to be sure there is no shorts in it.. still 5v on the other side..\n\nMy understandings is that there is one of CD chips that is blown witch affect the whole system there fore i have multiple questions:\n\nBest way to get this chip? If its from a donner board then it does need reball? How to get the old chip out (compound around it).\n\nAnd also regarding the connector, is it possible to use from a donor board or must be new? My understanding is that it will have to be soldered on using hot air since no access to pins, how then i should menage it in sort to be sure everything is soldered right and also not melt it?\n\nEdit: Forgot to check PP3V3_G3H, will do that tomorrow, but have a feeling its not related to charger ic..\n\nThank you!"

            "message": "Long time long time...\nAfter more than a year i finaly had some time to work on this one againe.\n\nEnded up fixing most of the pads and installing another chip (ub300)\nThe mother board does boot and work now\n\nHow ever i have a couple questions:\n\n1. I ended up not restoring 11, 22, and 26 (PP5V_S4_T_USBC) since they are all internaly related in the chip to pads 34 and 69 and those pads are still ok, also i have not fixed the pad 24 (UPC_TA_GPIO1) it look like it does not go anywhere\nIs it critical?\n\n2. I might damage the CB212 and C7006 in the procces. They look to be still connected but i am not sure. How crutial they are?\n\n3. The usb ports on the side of the board where the ub300 is are not working, not sure if its related to the issue #4 there is power output but no data( ex mouse recive power but does not work)\nBut it does charge the mac itself if connected to charger with those ports\n\n4. The mac does not wake up from the sleep. I am not yet sure why. Touchpad does click but black screen/no backlight. I run the diagnostic (D key) and there is no issues found\n\n\nPram reset did not help and it is freshly reinstalled os\n\nThank you!"
