It can probably also be another part of the board.\nIf yes, it can be defective LEDs inside the display assembly."

There is sign of burning on the top part of the board where a mosfet and a diode is located. Checked the diode and it is shorted. (Not sure about the mosfet yet)\nProblem is I cannot find the characteristics of the diode. The serial number written on it is irrelevant. Cannot get a replacement this way.\nAnybody has any idea what kind of diode is that?"
