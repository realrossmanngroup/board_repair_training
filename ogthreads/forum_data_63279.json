After 10-15 seconds the voltage drops down. With the 2.5MHz chip to 2.4V and with the 1MHz chip to 0.8V.\n\nThen the board keeps restarting after the gong.\nWhat do you think? Is this because of the chips, or do I have another problem wich have nothing to do with this chips?"

The Voltage drops down to 2.4V after 10-15 Seconds.\nThen i took an TPS621351RXG on the known good board - works perfect. So you can definitely use the TPS621351RXG as a replacement - that's good to know - i had a view damaged UC710 and had always to buy an expensive donor only to get this chip.\n\nBut there is still my problem with this board. It shows the Apple logo and a bit of the progress bar on the ext. Display, then it makes an restart.\nDo you have any hints what I can look for next?"
