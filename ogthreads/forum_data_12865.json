I can't figure out which ASD works on this one, 155 and 162 are a no go, and booting to diagnostmic mode lets me choose wifi, then choose language, then it just shuts it's piece of shit self off. verbose mode boot hangs after flagging the boot volume dirty. \n\n\nsomething's fuckity and I don't know where to start without an ASD or even diagnostic message to go off of. is there something I'm fucking up here?"
