            "message": "Hi,\n\nI made a stupid thing while trying to fix a fan connector issue on a 820-2914-A, shortcutting the PP5V_S0 to ground.\n\nAfter that I'm sure something blown, because I heard it and I smell it.\n\nSearching with microscope don't show anything damaged, but obviously the board is not working anymore. \n\nI'm trying to troubleshoot it. Actually PP3V42_G3H is not present (I read 0). \n\nPPVIN_G3H_P3V42G3H is present when the charger or the battery are connected (with the charger I read 16,48V).\n\nOn pin 8 and 2 of U6990 I can read 3,86V (P3V42G3H_FB), but the output of U6990 is 0.\n\nIf a use a multimeter in diode mode on the output (red on ground and black on pin) I read 0,001 so I think I have a shortcut somewhere.\n\nWhat is the best way to go on? Removing one by one the components on the line to find the one failing on injecting some power to find (I hope) the one heating?\n\nIs the time worth or the shortcut on PP5V_S0 could have destroyed the board?\n\nThanks"
