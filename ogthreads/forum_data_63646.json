            "message": "Hi.\n\nso short story, battery health was @ 55% capacity. before strip down the macbook would work, charge at 20v and didn't really appear to have any other issues. swapped battery and now taking no charge. was originally 5v 120 ma. after NVram and PRAM reset it went down to 38ma @ 5v. iv tried the original battery and same issue. i've checked all connections and all looks to be fine.\n\nNot sure what else to do. there is no damage or liquid anywhere on the board so a little lost as to why now after a battery change it no longer works.\n\nthanks"

Would a loose fitting usb port cause this? every cable seems slightly loose when fitting. Just weird why its failed for no apparent reason. \n\n\ncheers"
