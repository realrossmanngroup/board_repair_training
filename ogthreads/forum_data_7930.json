            "message": "Back with another difficult one :). Attached images show what I tested. Since I have 3.3v from 7200 can I assume the Chip is working fine, although 5v is not coming out? So im trying now to troubleshoot the enable signal but cant find any issues yet, accept for one R that showed wrong, see image description.\n\nOn a sidenote, my customer told me he used the mac for quite some time with a defect fan, maybe something fried. The board looks nice though and I have green + orange light on charger.\n\nGreetz\nArno"
