            "message": "A1466 came in stone dead. No PPBUS_G3H. Resistance to ground was near 0. So I injected 4.0V into G3H and see that Q7560 go hot. Changed it and only got 0.5V on G3H. Found F7140 was no good. Changed it and when I plugged in DC power Q7560 started to smoke. I see Q7560 does go to ground, so it is shorting to ground. When it was removed I did a continuity check on the pins with ground and none of them beeped. Like standing in a crossroad and saying DF?!"
