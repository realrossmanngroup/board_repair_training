            "message": "820-3332 once had a short on Q8961. After replacing it it worked fine. But just for a while.\nQ8930 now has a short and it does not turn on. After replacing Q8930 and U8900 at the same time it had fans-in again.\nbut no image :(. Did I fry the GPU? measuring it showed me that atleast it has no short on it. Tho it doesn't get warm and I have a Voltage reading neither on L8960 nor on L8930.\nWhat do you guys think could cause this issue. Should I measure if the traces are good ?"

If i close the lid it goes into hibrenation. display turns off and so does backlight. If i open it up again. it shows me an image but no backlight. I have tried to attach LCD_BKLT_EN to pp3v3_s3 but that didnt do that much. still same."
