            "message": "Hi,\nI have a liquid damaged board 820-2936-B.\nAfter ultrasonic cleaning it looks good and board turns on with or without battery.\nIt stays on for about 30 sec to 45 seconds. Sometimes it stays on long enough to have the OS up. (It has a SSD drive)\nBut it suddenly turns off by itself and don't turn back on unless I disconnect the battery.\nWhen the board is on fan spins at it's maximum speed!\nAny suggestion? What should I check and measure?\nThanks,"
