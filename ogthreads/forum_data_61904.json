            "message": "I have an 820-01814 with no backlight. The board is very clean and has no sign of liquid or anything else that is obvious. \n\nThere is 55v on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT - I understand that means it's not detecting a load/LED strings from the LCD. I have changed the LCD cable with a known LCD cable, a known good working LCD, and I changed the LCD connector despite it looking good. I also checked for continuity between J8500 and D8410 and it's there. \n\nI'm fresh out of ideas and was looking for another opinion in case I'm missing something or if someone had the same issue and maybe a solution.\n\nThanks for your help."
