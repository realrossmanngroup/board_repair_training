            "message": "Hi, i have a 00239 that had a small liquid spil near the display. Some liquid near the connector, but after wiping it looks clean no burned pins on the connector. Mac boots with external display, but does not output to the LCD. I have tried a working (cracked) LCD but same. Can it be that the power to the display failed? Or what should I be testing first? I am not experienced with these new ones :("
