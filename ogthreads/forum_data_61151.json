            "message": "Hi there,\n\nI  got a 820-00165 with a liquid damage around U7600. I'm in S0 State but ALL_SYS_PWGD is missing because of low PP1V05_S0.\nAlready replaced U7600 and C/R/Q7630. Resistance to ground on PP1V05_S0 seems good (320 Omh).\nHere are the voltages of U7600:\nPin 06 :1.8V\nPin 12: 5.1V\nPin 16: 3.3V\nPin 17: 0.0V\nAlready checked all traces and solders around U7600... they seem to be ok.\n\nAny ideas what else could be the problem here?\nThanks and best regards\nDudi"
