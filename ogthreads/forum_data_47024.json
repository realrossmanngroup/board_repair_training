Not chargin it.\n\n\nChecked U7200 and 27/28 pins have 20 ohms but 17/18 is going to millions ohms. Already changed u7200 with no result.\n\n\nPPBUS ( with only magsafe conecting is 14V than going down untill 2.8V and again 14V and all time like this. When the battery is connected 13.65V stable. \n\n3V42 is present but a little high ( 4V).\n\n\nMy bet is that SMC is bad, but want to ask before changing that shit."

R7050 is blown (less likely, but possible)\n3. The traces between the ISL and R7051/2 are blown or between R7051/2 and R7050. \n\nAlso why did you change U7200? Was it liquid damaged?"
