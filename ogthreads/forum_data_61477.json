I cannot find any 820-3536 files online, only 3476, are they the same??\n\nInspected board and some corrosion around U7200, and J6100, removed J6100 and replaced U7200 and same symptoms.\n\nIf anyone could provide thank you."

As well as E, D, C, and left command, hence why PRAM reset wasn't working.\n\nDoes anyone know what keys respond to what keyboard connector path?\n\nEDIT: Discovered U8000 had corrosion, and when attempting to clean with iso, chip shit itself and shorted everything to ground, and broke."
