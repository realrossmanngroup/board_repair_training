Also smoke should be coming from somewhere and there is NO WAY this board can even have a green light. P=U*I P=3.3*33=109W. Something must be dissipating 109W which is some serious heat!\nI have no idea what you are measuring or doing so I can't give any more advice at this point. Is this board even working at this point?"
