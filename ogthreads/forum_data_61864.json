            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have an A1466 820-00165 that has green light, but no fan spin and pulls only 25mA on bench PSU.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 0V\n\nF7140 seamed to be shorted and so I removed (no continuity). On pad 2 I get  0.24 ohm and 0.000 mV on diode mode.\nI inject 2.5V on PPBUS_G3H but nothing gets hot.\n\nCan you help?"
