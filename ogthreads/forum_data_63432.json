            "message": "Hi all,\n\nI have here a 820-01700 with minor liquid damage around u9080 area. Nobody touched it before, that's good but found more than 1 problem. I was not getting 20v on the USB amp meter and PPbus_G3H was jumping up and down, couldn't get a reading.\n\nFound that pp3v3_g3h was shorted by C9501. Removed that cap and got a nice ppbus and pp3v3_g3h. \n\nThen noticed pp2v5_nand_ssd1 is 2,5ohm to ground. Hoped for a bad U9080 but even after removing that still short. After injecting 2v into rail found heat was coming from U8600 which is only nand chip on this left top and bottom side (there are in total of 5 nand chips). \n\nI was wondering, I have another donor board 820-01700 witch exact same volume of nand chips. Can I suffice by only switching u8600. I read a few times that you always have to change them with sets, but these look exactly the same... \n\nPlease advice. Thxs"
