            "message": "Hi need some advice, board 820-2849 PP5V_S0 acting strange. need to find out where its shorted to ground. If i take RC215 off then pin 2 shows beautiful 5.02V and pin 1=2.27v , what i dont understand where does it take 2.27v when rc215 is off  as UC240 is no stuff. As soon as i put it on 5V disappear  leaving pin 2 with 0.05V. If i inject 5.5V to pin 1 then fans starts spinning and 5v stays as if its not shorted at all nothing gets warm. any ideas where to look at?"

Resistance to ground on L7425=051 is it normal? thanks for your time duke"
