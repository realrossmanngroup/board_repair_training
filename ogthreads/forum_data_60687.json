            "message": "Hi again all.\nHappy New Year.\n\nI've got a 2017 iMac that was working fine until we pulled it apart to upgrade the hard disk in it.\nOn reassembly, we now have no backlight.\n\nThere's no sign of physical damage to either of the two cables that connect the screen to the logic board, nor to the connectors themselves.\n\nThe only fuse nearby tests OK, and reads 12 volts on either side of it.\n\nWe've reseated the data cable to the back of the panel.\nWe've reset the SMC/PRAM.\n\nI do not have the schematics nor boardview for this model.\nI don't have a test screen or test logic board that matches this unit unfortunately.\n\nI believe from googling that the model of the logic board is 820-00597-A.\nI haven't taken the board back out, and assume the number is on the other side, as I can't locate it on the visible side.\n\nAny suggestions as to where to start?\nThanks for any help you can provide."
