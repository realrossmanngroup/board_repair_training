            "message": "Hi MacBook 15\" 2008 board 820-2532-A\nIt would not power on but I repaired it so it now powers on but Beeps once every five secconds. This goes on forever.\nAccording to Apple's support site this indicates a RAM issue or RAM not being detected by the Mac.\nHave tried swapping out the RAM but no luck.\n\nThe initial repair I did was replacing U7700 and the components surrounding it and rebuilt alot of the tracks around that area. I think this area may have had liquid damage or the charger used was a knock off one.\n\nAny help appreciated. Thanks"
