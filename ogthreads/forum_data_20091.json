            "message": "Hi. So, I have a board here that came in with no backlight, but had full video. I replaced C9020 and C9796 because they looked burnt. Also L9080 was missing completely so I replaced that as well. Turned the laptop on to see if it made a difference and I got a chime with a quick flash from the backlight and no video whatsoever. Just darkness. Started measuring around and this is how far I got before things got worse.\n\nU900 PN 4,5 3.2V\nLCD_IG_EN 3.2V\n\nUpon measuring pins 2,3,4 on LVDS voltage started at 3.3 and dropped until I noticed that L9004 had pretty much imploded into a bubble at some point during taking measurements. Right now it looks like it could be welded to the board and C9015, C9010 and L9008 dont look so great either. Thanks for any help in advance. Have a good one."

            "message": "Thanks for the response. Though I am definitely interested in doing BGA rework in the future if there is money in it and it becomes more demanding for me I will take your advice and practice with my hot air station. (crawl before you walk type thing)Thanks again Duke. Have a good one.\n\nPS. $1000 for good working station. (more info if you get a chance)\n\n\"Gurmon\" just saw your response after I posted response. Thank You for your help. To pay someone to do it wouldn't be in my best interest for this board I don't think.  Thanks man."
