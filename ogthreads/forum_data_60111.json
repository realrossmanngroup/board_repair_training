            "message": "hey! nice new forum. i like the fact that i can now pay by card and i dont have to use paypal\n\ngot a 00165 here with multiple spots of liquid damage. sorted a few issues so far,\non first boot, the main issue was that L7320 was heating up. realised that PPBUS_g3h was short. i sorted that ( i really cant remember how because i've done so much work on this board)\nanyway the coil at the start no longer heats up but q7310 did, i replaced that (yes i know, no path to ground but i hunted for a short on the other side of it with none to find. replaced it and now fine. checked the chips themselves off board, the one i took off had a straight path between pin 4 and 5 with no resistance, the new one seems fine in that department.\n\nAnyway, all S5 rails are present, and nothing else except the SUS rails are also present. SMC bypass doesn't work (doesn't even react at all but SMC reset works)\nSo now i've removed L7320 and L7310 and theres a 0.3 ohm short to ground on both on the CPU side.\n\nLet me take a guess, PCH screwed right?\n\nhoping this all makes sense and you can all make sense of my jibbershit, im tired as hell after working on this board for most of the day"
