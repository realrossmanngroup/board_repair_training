            "message": "Hi there. I have an Apple Macbook Air A2179 with water damage. It was not charging and was stuck on 5v. I removed the board, and there were corrosions on multiple spots I cleaned and resoldered using flux to make sure all disconnections connected back again. \n\nThen I connected the charging cable to USB-C Meter and it started to use 20v 0.12 amp. Amp started to go up and back to 0.12. Amp usage was going to 0.35 and then back to 0.12 and then up to 0.55 and back to 0.12, t9 0.70 and back to 0.12.\n\nThe CPU area got hot, and it felt like the mainboard booted. I connected the board to Apple Configurator to see if it is in DFU mode or not. It did not detect it. I assembled the board on a different working A2179 body and started charging and using an amp 2.6amp. The fan was silent, and the screen was black. I connected my iPhone to another USB-C port and the iPhone was taking charge from the Board.\n\nBut the board was making a ticking sound near L7400. I removed that coil and powered the board. The ticking noise is gone. I put in a new L7400 coil, but the ticking sound came back. I need your guidance to get the issue fixed. \n\nThank you again.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else. \n\nRegards\nZeyd"

            "message": "I put the L7400 chips back in place on good and customer boards. Did a diode mode to the ground, and they have similar ohm on both sides? 215-400 Ohms. CPU is getting warm, the board charges the iPhone, and also getting charged from the USB-C cable. Does it mean the CPU works fine?\n\nYour comment: Inspect for corrosion the audio board/flex and touch ID. I used a working new audio board/flex and Touch ID from different computer. The result is the same. \n\nI should do diode mode readings on all J6100. socket contacts? right? Thanks."

Does it mean the CPU works fine?\"\nDon't make confusion between USB power and activity.\nCheck USB activity properly; already explained on the forum.\nSee at least if Caps Lock light reacts.\nYou can also test external video; w/ and w/o internal LCD connected.\n\nCompare CPU core voltage with good board; allow 10-15s after power is applied."
