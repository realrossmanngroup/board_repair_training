            "message": "I have an 820-00045 that has no power, It has no liquid damage, and the chasis is in good condition so i doubt its impact damaged.\nstarted poking around and noticed i have 3v3_S5 but no PP3v3_SUS pinpointed this fault to a break between Pin 6 of u8020 and R1464. \n\nran a jumper wire and got PP3v3_sus back, however im still missing some rails unfortunately (no voltage L7520, L7561, L7820, L7430) None of these rails are shorted either. \nMy worry is that i found one bad trace somewhere in the PCB. There may be more bad traces. \nAnyone have any suggests where to check next? I am still missing PM_SLP_S4_L but have 3v3_sus PM_DSW_PGOOD, PP3v42RTC"
