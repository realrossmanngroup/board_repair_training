            "message": "Working on a board that had liquid damage, and after replacing all questionable components, board had ppbus_g3h at .5v. Found the board had a shorted Q7320. Replaced Q7320 and Q7321, and the short is now gone and I have a good 8.56v on ppbus_g3h, but I'm missing PM_SLP_SUS_L. PM_DSW_PWRGD is present, but PM_SLP_SUS_L and all my sustain signals are not present. No shorts found. U8020 is covered in that protective conformal coating, and I didn't try replacing it yet, but if worth a try I will. I just figured since the liquid went near the CPU and shorted that MOSFET, that my CPU may be toast.\n\nShould I waste any more time on this?"
