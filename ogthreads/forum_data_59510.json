I have yet to hear the fans spin fast though.\n\nWater damaged.  Someone has attempted to clean the board so corrosion is hard to find, but it's obvious water did hit near one of the CD3215 ICs.\n\nThree of the four USB-C ports work fine, and will charge the machine with 20v and 2A.\n\nHowever the port in the back left does not work properly.  If I plug tester in one direction I get 5v and 0A, and if I flip the connection over the tester fails to even power on.\n\nEverything I have read says if one CD3515 is bad, all USB ports will stop functioning.  If this is accurate information, does it rule out CD3215 problem here?"
