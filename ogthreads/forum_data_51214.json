It was slightly liquid damaged around U1900 main board has been cleaned and inspected. I tested laptop with ASD, no sensor or other fault found. New EFi with old dumped bin and ME region cleaned doesn't resolve issue.\nAll main rails are ok. \nAny idea what could slowing down this Mac ?\nAlso I tried new battery other trackpad with new flex, new power board with new flex, other ssd different USB key with system no luck. \nAnyone have something like this before? \nAny help much appreciated. \nThanks"

I expected in first place it will be thermal sensor issue that how it looks like but no errors. Do you think if there is no errors SMC still could be faulty? It will be very unusual unless some liquid damage go under. I will check it tomorrow and report here if SMC from donor board resolve issue."
