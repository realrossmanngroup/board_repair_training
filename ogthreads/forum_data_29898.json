            "message": "This board had liquid damage, I saw red points and destroyed test points near one side of SMC, it looks like liquid spread out on all the board both sides but no heavy corrosion.\nThe board was spinning only once for 4-5 seconds and just stop. There was no usual RTC cycling (on/off, on/off and on).\n\nAll rails  ppbus_g3h: 8,6V and pp3v42_g3h: 3,42V with orange/green light including PWROK 3.4V on pin 3 of U1950, VCORE 1.75V, 32Mhz, PPVRTC were present during the laps where fan spins. When fan stops there was no more pm_slp_s4_l  and got only S5 and SUS rails.\n\nWhat I did:\nI replaced R7121 (120ohms instead of 10ohms), this changed nothing.\nI checked near smc and repaired traces going to SMC from R5178 TDO and R5182 SMC_BIL_BUTTON (physically not used in this board).  This changed nothing.\nI checked for SMC_RESET_L, it was present 3.4V but when I touch the test point with my probe in voltage mode it made the fan spin again and stop, I noticed also the magsafe light switching to green and coming back to orange. I replaced just in case U5110 but this also changed nothing.\nAt this point I decided to give SMC a slight reflow and the board now boots ok\n\nNow the issue:\nFan goes progressively high but it\u2019s not trackpad TS0P related issue. I ran EFI and found the following errors:\n\n1)      Display Port (test 2 verifes no more than one error in 30s) -> Error \u2013 Lane count is zero \nI will confirm tomorrow with internal lcd and run again EFI. I used only external monitor can this only be the cause?\n\n2)      VP0R ->  Error \u2013 Sensor is reading below the low limit Error\nThis error appears only with battery plugged, I will confirm tomorrow and let it charge or just try another one. Hardware profile shows -6.5V\nAnd I am using genuine but 85W charger, is that the reason? I would expect a higher value with this charger.\n\n3)      TM0P MLB Top ->  Error \u2013 Sensor is reading below the low limit \nHardware profile shows -124Celsius must be a short or an open condition?? It says Memory proximity sensor. In schematic there is no reference to an MLB top sensor except for Q5850  marked \u201cPlacement note: TBD\u201d (To be determined or what??).\nMy only guess is Q5850, because it\u2019s on the TOP and near ram memory as reported by EFI.\nU5810 looks a little shitty no way to tell if someone tried tor repair or only crap from liquid damage I will replace it anyways.\n\nAny thoughts about these errors?\n\nThanks"

            "message": "VP0R is just a completely empty or dead battery.\nDisplay port error? Is the internal LCD working or are you using an external LCD?\nTM0p is Q5810 so either that is damaged or U5800 or the traces between them."

            "message": "Indeed after charging battery VP0R error didn't show up anymore.\n\nYes it was display error Test 2. I was using external lcd because earlier, board was very far from life. I finally tried an lcd and discovered I had no backlight, image present. A5 ball was semi exploded with crap, the pad was ok! I replaced lcd driver and backlight is back. Now, there is no EFI display error with internal lcd attached, there is display error when it's not attached, I don't recall with macbook airs if it's normal to have this error with no lcd attached? I will try with another board but at this point I am not concerned anymore about this.\n\nTM0P was caused by shorted C5813, it was shorting out emitter and collector of Q5850 (also on top MLB, near ram chips).\n\nThanks this one can be marked solved."
