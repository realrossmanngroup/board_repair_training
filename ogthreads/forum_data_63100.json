            "message": "Hello , first of all I'd like to say that this is my firt board level repair so please be patient if I get things wrong (like I forget to specify important details), I'll try my best. I've got a 820-02098 board which is liquid damaged. Firt of all after removing the board i checked for liquid damage and I cleaned it as much as i could with IPA, but averall the board looked pretty good (no visibly broken componets, no blacked-out areas).  I then moved to check if the capacitors with the most oxidation where shorted out but I couldn't find any. Luckily I got my hands on the schematics ([URL]https://www.badcaps.net/forum/showthread.php?t=110182&highlight=m1+pro+schematic[/URL]), with that plus the repair wiki i found out that my 3.8V line is working properly (or at least I read 3.8V according to the repair wiki). The problem comes with the PP5v_S2_MAIN line, indeed I don't get any voltage (measured from the inductor indicated in trw), so I moved to the boardview and found that that inductor is connected to 3 pads of the adiacent chip (the one in the image, the pads highlighted). My issue is that that area wasn't damaged at all by liquid (at least not visibly) so I don't know why the problem could be there, but also it looks like the pads aren't properly soldered. I decided to try and desolder it using aboundant flux and a hot-air station. At first I set it to 200C but couldn't get anything moving so I moved gradually to 300C until I decided to stop because I didn't want to cause any damage. My questions are: could this chip be the problem or maybe the absence of PP5v_S2_MAIN is determined by some other component I couldn't locate? If so how can remove it properly?"

Regarding the power supply controller I get 12V on the power pins and nothing (sometimes it briefly jumps) on the enable pin. Rails 3V3_S2 and 1V2_S2 seems to be down (I wasn't sure where to check so I just looked in the boardview for resistors and capacitors connected to that line). I am not sure about DFU, I will check as soon as I get it together, but I know the magsafe charger is not lighting up and the battery contacs show 164mA."
