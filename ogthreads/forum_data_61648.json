Customer says that for last 2 days charging was unstable, then laptop just turned off\n\nNow there is 3 CD3215 in the loop, UB400 stable\nBoard is clean, no corrosion, no oxidation\nFound blown resistor RB036 ( replaced)\nAlready changed UB400 ( 2 times, with known-good chip), UB300 (just for case), QB400 and UB090 (from same donor board) - still 5v\nPP3V3_G3H is present\nAll CD3215 except UB400 has 1.1 LDOs\nCompared all LDOs in diode mode with other chips-it is similar (0.470 - 0.500)\nChecked all resistors around UB400 and UB300 - values matching schematic\nChecked all traces under UB400 - no problem there.\n\nWhat else might cause this issue?"
