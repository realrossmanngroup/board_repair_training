            "message": "Hi, I have a mac air 11 inch with no obvious liquid spil but many probe points look discolored from corrosion. Smoke was coming out of Q7260 and U7201 was frying so I replace both. Now I have a green light on the charger, no orange. I do have orange when i connect a battery, not sure how these old ones work with regards to one wire circuit. Measure the following:\n\nPPBUS_G3H     8.39\nPP3V42_G3H    3.4v\nPP3V3_S5      3.3v\nPP5V_S5_LDO     5v\nPP5V_S3       0v\n\nU6100 looks very clean, gets 3.3v in.\n\nU7201\nPin 21 P3V3S5_EN                   3.48v\nPin 4 P5VS3_EN                   0.204v\nPin 23 VIN                          8.39v\npin 12 SMC_PM_G2_EN       3.39v\nPin 25 SW2                       3.31\nPin 32 SW1                       0v\n\nResistors on S3 Rail Enables measure OK.
