No water under U8100 but damage to a few caps in the area.\nUnit would not engage 20v\n\nI pulled U8100 in an attempt to split ball it which was unsuccessful.  So I need a replacement.  I don't trust the one I have.\n\nQuestion:  Can these be changed or is there some apple voodoo that married it to the machine?  If they can be changed were do I find them.  I was unsuccessful split balling this when I pulled so I am sure I would fail with a donor as well."

Ipad 8th gen PMIC is common and I pop them on and off in 5 minutes.\n\nI just don't want to stencil one to find out they are married.  I am not able to split ball these.
