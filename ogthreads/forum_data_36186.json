            "message": "i bought this Mac on eBay so I can learn how to fix macs. Issue is with the charger I have a faint green light and no fan spin. I ended up replacing U7000 do to having a short.   Once I replaced the Ic I was able to get proper voltage. \n\nAs as of now I have the following:\n\nU6901: 3.42vdc pin5\nU6900: 3.42vdc pin1\n             3.42vdc pin 5\n             3.41vdc pin 4\n\nat this point I have no clue where to go next. Thanks in advance."
