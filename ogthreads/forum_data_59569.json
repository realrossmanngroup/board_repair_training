Everything checks out, ut upon handling the board i noticed that both QB300 and QB400 get extremely hot (burnt my finger on them). when using the corresponding USBC ports.\nI know mosfets can get pretty hot in general, but this is extreme. Could this point to anything? Or should i just go ahead and replace them?\nThe fets on the other end of the board dont get anywhere near this hot when usbc charger is connected on that end."

(it booted into my testdrive and i could see the onboard SSD and browse its files)\n\ni then noticed the burning hot mosfets UB300/400 and decided to replace them. \nAfterwards, the board still booted, but this time coming up with the Critical Update thing.\nAfter a couple of tries, the board can't see its own SSD anymore"
