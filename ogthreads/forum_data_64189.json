            "message": "Hello guys\n\nI have this board that i am working on for a few days and at this point i am lost and need some help.\n\nIf anyone can help would be great.\n\nSo this computer came with a shutdown problem, was really slow and when appear the password of the client shutdown immediately every single time. Other problem was that a lot of times the computer didn\u00b4t start.\n\nI did remove the board to inspection and add corrosion on u6100, i did clean and replace r6116 because wasn\u00b4t good but problem persist. Then with further testing i replace r7006 because wasn\u00b4t good after that the problem off only power sometimes was solved.\n\nBut i still had the slow and crash problem, after that just for testing i did replace de u6100 from a donor. I was kinda happy because the after that the laptop was slow but didn\u00b4t crash anymore. But then i saw another problem every time i insert the login password the progress bar was really slow and never pass from there.\n\nOnce again i inspect the board and i miss corrosion in other point of the board this time u5110, i replace the ic from donor board and after that the board start once or twice and now is dead.\n\n\nNow i will post some values for someone can help have a light of what i have here:\n\nPPBUS_G3H 8.58V\nPP3V42_G3H 3.41V\nPP3V3_SUS 3.32v\nPP3V3_S0 0v\nPP3V3_S5 3.32v\nPP3V3_S3 0v\nPP5V_S0 0v\n\nU5110\n1_ 3.41V\n2_ 0V\n3_ 3.41V\n4_ 2.76V\n5_ 3.38V\n6_ 3.34V\n7_ 3.41V\n8_ 3.29V\n\nI did trigger SMC_ONOFF_L and PM_PWRBTN_L drop from 3.41V to 0.35V\n\nPM_BATLOW_L 3.4V\nPCH_DSWVRMEN 3.22V\nPM_DSW_PWRGD 3.41V\nSMC_ADAPTER_EN 3.41V\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.32V\nRTC_RESET_L 3.32v\nPCH_SRTCRST_L 3.32v\nPCH_INTVRMEN_L 3.22v\nPM_RSMRST_L 3.29v\n\nI did try SMC bypass and the board start with the fan at high rpm and don\u00b4t have any light in the charge is that normal? Other thing i notice was that PPBUS_G3H 8.18V.\n\nI did check the page 11 pch decoupling and this are the results:\n\nC1200 3.32V\nC1202 3.32V\nC1204 3.32V\nC1206 3.32V\nC1208 0V\nC1210 0V\nC1212 0V\nC1214 0V\nC1250 0V\nC1255 0V\nC1260 0V\nC1264 0V\nC1266 0V\nNow in SMC Bypass mode:\nC1200 3.32V\nC1202 3.32V\nC1204 3.32V\nC1206 3.32V\nC1208 3.32V\nC1210 1.5V\nC1212 3.32V\nC1214 3.32V\nC1250 1.05V\nC1255 1.05V\nC1260 1.047V\nC1264 1.05V\nC1266 1.05V\nC1267 1.05V\n\nL1270 1.05V\nL1275 1.05V\nL1280 1.05V\nL1290 1.05V\nL1295 1.05V\n\nNow i am lost and i don\u00b4t know what i should look for, so if anyone can help i appreciate,\n\nSorry for the big text but i tried to resume the best i can and collect the max data possible.\n\nBest regards"
