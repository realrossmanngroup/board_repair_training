            "message": "Hello,\n\nI have a 820-3476 that does not turn on (sometimes). If it turns on, it would be totally fine, but if I leave it or if I press force shut down it would be unable to boot up again unless I unplug battery, unplug charger and connect again. Even then it would be intermittent.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 14 volts. Is this too high?\nI replaced the ISL, checked the Resistors R121/22/51/52, all checks out. Traces are good it seems. Replaced Q7130, but still getting 14 volts.\n\nI notice also when the computer does turn on, pins 5/6 of the BIOS is only 2 volts, is this normal?"
