            "message": "Hi smart guys\n\nRecently I spilled beer on my old macbook and now want to fix it. I am a hardware designer and dont do repairs, so no experience in troubleshooting. Please, help me with it.\n\nSo A1425 13 inch Macbook Pro Retina. It was on when I spilled bear and it immediately shut itself off. Took me about an hour to get to home and teardown. I was surprised how much of green corrosion grew for such short time, most of corrosion was around INA current sensors and mosfets at top part of pcb (where air vents), some around components around smc but not much. After cleaning pcb visually all is ok and not much damage. I found a broken connection on one of INA, but no changes after fixing connection. I checked U5410 and U5400 where were most of corrosion and I see with osciloscope that they works fine. I also checked a few voltage sense circuits to make sure their signals goes all the way to smc.\n\nNo boot.\nGreen light on charger than switches to amber(no battery connected)\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.56V\nSMC_RESET_L - 3.09V (when I measure it in diferent parts of pcb I see slightly diferent voltage)\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.4V\nPPV5_S5, PP3V3_S5 and other S5 and G3Hs are good and present.\nAll others S0..S4 powerails are off but jumps to designed voltage every 5s for a 200ms pulse.\nI did not spot any damage component or short.\nFor me it feels like SMC tries to go to S0 state, but senses wrong voltage/current and shuts everything off, than cycle repeats in 5 seconds. Or it is indeed has a short circuit on one of sub rails.\n\nAny ideas what to check?\n\nThanks in advance."

I think fans just starts with max speed during SMC bypass and that gave me wrong impression that it works longer.\nI checked PPVCORE_S0_CPU with oscilloscope, voltages goes to 1.2v for 50ms than slowly discharges back to 0.\nAre you sure about page 43 & 44? In schematics that I have there is no page 43, and 44 has peripheral connectors."
