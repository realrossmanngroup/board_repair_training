Yes there are some hacks out there to boot off Intel GFX but they are buggy and will not survive a PRAM reset and who knows what else. Replace GPU or just dump it on Ebay, they still sell for $$$ even with dead GPU as there are many idiots that will reflow them and call it fixed with 30 day warranty."
