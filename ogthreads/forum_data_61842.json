Sometimes for longer and fans would spin up for a second then stop, then repeat.\n\nNow dead with no green light.\npp3v42 0v (40k ohm to ground so no short)\nppvin_g3h_p3v42g3h 0v\npp18v5_dcin_conn_r 0v\nppdcin_g3h 0.56v\nResistance seen by charger 63kohms\ncharger no load 0.6v (both my 60W and 85W chargers show same 0.6v)\n\nIs the pp3v42 power supply supposed to start with 0.6v ?\nNeed help!"
