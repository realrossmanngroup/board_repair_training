            "message": "I have a MacBook Pro, no water damage or anything, but it wouldn't power on. Was getting green light, no orange light, and no power. I disconnected the BIL connector cuz I've noticed it's a common issue, and sure enough the light turned orange, battery started charging, and computer turned on. The odd thing is, once the battery had at least 1% charge, I pulled power off the board, reconnected the BIL (J6955), connected the battery and ac, and boom it works fine now. I can disconnect it, reconnect it, power off, on, and all works fine.\n\nIf I have the battery unplugged I get 3.42v into SMBUS_BATT_SDA & SMBUS_BATT_SCL, and the pull up resistors measure 2K Ohms.\n\nWhat should I be looking at?"
