            "message": "Worked about 2 hours on an 820-3115 that had liquid to the area directly between the SMC and LVDS, about .5\" in from the edge. Replaced quite a number of things, ran 4-5 wires, etc., but everything looked good and I had confidence it would work. Liquid didn't make it to the SMC from what I can tell, and the reverse side of the board is clean as a whistle.\n\nRestored power and fan, but board beeps 1 time, which I know indicates a hardware failure on the board. How would I go about finding the fault that's causing the beep? Never really had a case like this one. I don't believe it's RAM related, but I'm not sure if the one-beep code can include circuitry for the RAM, or if that would \"always\" be a 3-beep pattern.\n\nAny ideas?"

I've replaced hundreds of LP8550s, but either goofed this one up or had a bad chip (I probably fucked up, can't blame the chips every time--chip came from a roll of 100 and all others were fine). In any event, this ugly ass board actually works now--thanks, you guys. Always nice to have a board come to life after 2-3 hours of work. I hope the CPU is OK--it literally singed me to the point of leaving a blister. \n\nDuke, you can close this one up as solved. Board chimes and is breathing."
