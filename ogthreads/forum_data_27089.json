U7600 was also replaced.\nI have followed the SPI traces and everything seems to connect. I haven't checked the resistors values yet around the Bios (Note to self)\nI was able to make a backup of the Bios 3 times with no errors.\n\nPPBUS_G3H, PPVRTC_G3H and PP3V42 have a nice stable voltage.\n\nSMC area looks fine, no liquid damage there. I haven't reflowed it yet.\n\nI have tried plugging a battery but no cigar.\n\nAny idea?"

If they look merged or messed up reball or replace it.\n\nIf you dumped the BIOS by using J6100 you can ignore this, but if you didn't make sure the BIOS (U6100) has proper connection to the board by cleaning up the loads of flux surrounding it and manually inspecting the solder joints. If its messed up desolder it, put some solder on the pads and solder it back on again.\nYou said you already checked the bios traces and termination resistors so I assume that part of the circuit is alright. Make sure the traces that do no longer have their coating on them are not shorting to other traces though\n\nInspect the clock chip if it looks questionable or the solder joints aren't that great you can either touch them up or just replace the chip to be sure (Its just about $2).\n\nMaybe duke has some other tips as well"
