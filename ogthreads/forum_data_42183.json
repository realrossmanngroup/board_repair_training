Checked traces from ton resistors to u7400 and nothing was wrong there.\n\nyet no changed i still get just a high fan spin no cpu. what should i try next?"

Ton resistors are recieving its 12.5v on one end and half a volt on the other.\n\ni am getting voltages on u6100 so all traces are good there.\n\nnow i think the cpu is dead on this. When measuring on an o scope i get voltage bursts up to 16v and cpu is getting hot."
