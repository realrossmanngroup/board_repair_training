Yes, same behaviour and current consumption on all ports.\n\n0.9, 1.1 and 2.5 are present on SSD lines\n\nCPU_AWAKE are around 10Ohms - 0.5V\nP0V8SLPDDR are at 35Ohm range - 0.8V\nThe remaining are over 100Ohms.\n\nAl coils around U7800 provide voltage apart than PPVVPRIMCORE L7821/2\n\nI have replaced U3100 again, and now gets 20V 0.01A almost consistent across all 4 ports. Sometimes just takes ages to transition from 5V 0.5A to 20V 0.01A. Disconnect and connect the adapter and then goes straightforward. T2 is getting warm\n\nIs T2 also responsible for PD handshake or only CD32's?"
