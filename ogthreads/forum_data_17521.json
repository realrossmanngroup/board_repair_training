            "message": "820-3209 no green light\nI have no other dc board to test but I have another working 3209 board and it works with customer dc board. So it is not DC BOARD.\nI am confused what to do next as one wire circuite is not on main board.\n\nI checked ACOK pin 14 isl6259 and it is 3.3V\nPPBUS - 8.39V\nBoard is no liquide damage. Pretty clean. Customer told me one day stoped working. I heated SMC a little but no change.\nSMC_Adapter_EN - 3.3V\nSMC_BC_ACOK - 3.3V\nsmc_reset_L - 3.3V\n\nWhat more to check?"
