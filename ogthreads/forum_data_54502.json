            "message": "Hi. \n\nGot this board. It doesnt detect SSD, after 3-4 minutes get question folder. Also tried to boot from USB and it doesnt detect it too, there is usb activity ( mous light turn on when plug). Also macbook doesnt allow me to make PRAM reset, i think keyboard is not detected too ( only let me make smc reset), when start with option pressed and no ssd but macos usb, it also doesnt detect the key. \n\nThere is no water damage. Just stop working. What can it be? \n\nVisually logic board seems be ok. \n\n\nthanks"

Flex also had been changed. \n\nIn last start i pressed D and it stated in diagnostic menu when machine asks to connect to internet but mouse not workin. Keyboard CAPS button work and give green light but i must press it for few second and wait about 20 so light turn on and same to turn it off. \n\n\nMay it be something wrong with clock or something like that because now seems that machine works but its extremely slow in everything."
