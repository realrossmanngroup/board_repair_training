Battery lock up, but same case when using known good battery.\nwhen on only battery, ppbus is pulsing about 12v(can't get a good ready from osope) 2 short pulse within 1sec and 2/3 sec of no activity and loops.\n\nMeasure current sensing for ISL R7061/R7062 and all is good, measured SMB_SMC_CHGR_SDA and SCL and i get normal communication with SMC(diode reading at 0.395)\nnot sure what else is wrong here"
