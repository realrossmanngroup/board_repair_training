Nothing is warming. Absolutly nothing.\n\nChecked R5450 and seems that PPBUS is shorted to ground through PPBUS_S5_HS. Removing R5450 short on PPBUS-G3H desappear.\n\n\nAny advice? Inject voltage on PPBUS_S5_HS_Computing_ISNS and check what is getting warm again?\n\n\nP.S. Also checked meanwhile Q7310/20 and Q7430/630 not seems to be the reason of the short"

I did it because many people on this forum after facing PPBUS shorted recomend that (Like Duke). Sure i started injecting in 1V and max was 2V."
