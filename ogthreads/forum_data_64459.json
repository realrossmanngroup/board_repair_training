I found two burnt & melted inductors (L5100 and L8504) and a burnt via near U8500. Fixing those issues restored the backlight and Touch Bar.\n\nBut the board is missing Wifi and Bluetooth (no hardware recognized). It also does not read external USB drives. It does have PP3V3_G3S_WLANBT and PP1V8_G3S_WLANBT."
