            "message": "Hi Guys, I have a 820-3787, black display and I cannot find the issue all voltage seems there. Found some resistor off value near U7701, I replace the R and also U7701. After that, backlight on but I get a complete white display. All LED returns have correct value all voltages present 3.3v and 44v. Seems some data issue? Tried display in another Mac and it works fine so must be logicboard issue. Also changed LVDS connector."
