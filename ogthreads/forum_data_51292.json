            "message": "Currently working on a 820-3437 where power supply is pulling .02Amps. Device has no signs of liquid damage. Always present power rails are present. SMC_RESET_L is present. PM_SLP_S4_L is missing. Board does not boot in SMC Bypass. I discovered the tiniest amount of corrosion under SMC on Pad 64 which is SMC_PWRFAIL_WARN_L. Did not find corrosion anywhere else on board. I reflowed SMC to remove the corrosion and device still pulls .02Amps and does not boot in SMC Bypass. Before I spend the time pulling off SMC and Reballing, is this a sign of a dead CPU?\n\nSorry for the brief explanation."
