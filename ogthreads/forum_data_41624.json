            "message": "This board was liquid damaged around the lcd connector area and the bottom side of the board by the lcd connector. I have replaced the lcd connector, lcd cable and the following components.\nL8300, C8300/03, C8359, I also replaced a component also in that area(image attached) but I don't know what the component is for because i don't have a boardview for for 4924 so I have to use the one for the 820-3536.\nThere are some other caps/resistors and chips that don't look too good in that area but they are for Thunderbolt so I just left them.\n\nThere was no continuity from C8300/03 to the BKLT pin 1 of J8300 so I had to run a wire to connect those lines.\nWhen I plug in the charger and screen I feel the CPU getting warm but even after 30 seconds of it being on I see no image on the screen even with a flashlight shined on it.\nI also get 3.3v on Pins 6/7 of the connector. Pin 1 for BKLT gives me 0v\nQ7700 voltages:\nPin 4: 12.56v\nPin 3: 12.46v\nPins 1/2/5/6: 0.05v\n\nSMC_LID is a steady 3.4v\n\nR7701/02 have the proper resistance measurements\nR7742 has 0v on both sides so I think that may be an issue."
