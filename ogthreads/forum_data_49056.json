I tried without the pci ssd with external hdd with usb and it still freezes. The diagnostic while holding d at the start does not show any errors. Any ideas? Could it be the wifi board, or the lcd screen?"

If board is clean, then yeah best bet is to try replacing all the FDMF6808 controllers with NEW FDMF6708 chips from Mouser or Digikey. Make SURE you let the board cool or just UC it before firing it back up to test"
