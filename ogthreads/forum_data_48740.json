            "message": "Have a 820-2915 that already has a new 2017 GPU before I received it. Has a power problem with PPBUS_G3H. When R5410 is soldered I have short on PPBUS_G3H with no fan spin but when it is removed short gone and board powers up but no video. Tried replacement R5410 but no change\n\nCan this be caused by shorted GPU since R5410 is on GPU power rail?"
