            "message": "Hey guys,\nI have an issue that I'm hoping someone can please help me with.\nIt is an 820-00165 which has a flickering display after logging in. During startup, the apple logo is displayed and the machine loads to the login screen. After logging in, just before the loading bar completes, the screen starts flickering. It appears to be the screen itself, not the backlight but I could be wrong.\nExternal display works with the screen plugged in or not.\nI have tested with another known good screen, IO board and cable and have removed the board from chassis.\nNo physical damage can be seen. LVDS looks clean and continuity between pins and caps/resistors is fine but I have touched up the joints to make sure. I have also reflowed U7701 but have not yet replaced it. I have replaced C8324 because it looked a little funny but no change.\nDiode readings on LVDS connector all seem roughly .050 or .060 below values shown on logi.wiki.\n[URL='https://streamable.com/a9nxvc']Here is a video[/URL] of the issue.\n\nThank you very much for reading.\nM"

I tested it to be thorough but i also figured it would affect the memory reading in the system specs or the system functionality as a whole. \n\nI kind of landed on it being a CPU issue after everything seemed normal around the display/backlight circuit but I couldn't shrug the feeling that a cpu issue would again, affect the functionality of the machine. Everything else is running perfectly and that's why I felt like I needed an expert opinion. I know this is a weird one so again, I appreciate your help so far.\n\nI will let you know what happens with  Windows2go."
