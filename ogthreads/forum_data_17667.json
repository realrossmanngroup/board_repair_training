            "message": "Badly corroded around U7100 and no PPBUS_G3H. Removed the old one, added a few jumper wires and soldered on a new U7100. It now starts and works fine, the problem I'm having now is that it always \"detects\" a charger even if not connected. It senses wether I'm using a 60W or 85W charger but does not register that I remove it. It charges fine and displays battery status, charge cycles, remaining power and so on. I have tried with another MagSafe/IO board and cable. I have also tried with another battery. Also I have reset the SMC."
