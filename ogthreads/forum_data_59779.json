            "message": "I am hoping you guys experience issue i have. I have been fixing Apple products for over 10 years. \nI wanted to help a friend and install 2 tb SSD to his 2014 iMac 21.5. Which is quite easy to do but it didn't go as expected.\n\nWhen the item arrived it was in sleep mode and it was unplugged. \nI took apart  the iMac installed ssd and went for command + R.\nIt came on fan starts spinning and got stuck on led #2.\nSO i changed the internal battery tried all resets nothing.\nAfter 15 min fan going it chime and nothing happened.
