            "message": "This board sent in because the fans were running on full blast after a water spill. I ran the efi diagnostics and it told me the trackpad cable was the issue so I replaced that and the machine was working fine a couple hours ago. I decided to clean the corrosion from the liquid damage which was only around the following areas.\nQ8150/Q1930 (attached image)\nR8158/59\nQ7310 (very light and only on pin 1 side)\n\nI just put some flux and heated the area to remove corrosion. I replaced R8152&R8158 because they looked burned on one side. After doing those repairs the board no longer turns on even though PP5V_S0 and PP3V3_S0 are present.\n\nI measured R8167 and on Pin 1(PM_SLP_S3_BUF_L) there was 3.32v and Pin 2(ALL_SYS_PWRGD) there was 0.11v. I replaced Q8150 and U1930 since they were connected to ALL_SYS_PWRGD but that didn't change anything.\n\n\nUpdate: I see a little corrosion on the C1924 side of the U1900 clock chip and C1924 looks slightly black on one side. Could that be causing this and should I go ahead and replace this?\n\nAlso I see U5110 has some corrosion on pin 1 but 3.4v was present on all pins except for pin 2. Pin 4 (SMC_MANUAL_RST_L) - 2.78v"
