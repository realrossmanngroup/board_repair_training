It has green light (only with original charger) the fan spins,  it consumes 250mA on PSU, but don't have any USB activity.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.5V\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.4V\nPP5V_S0 = 5.0 V\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.3V\nPP3V3_SUS = 3.3V\nPP1V05_SUS = 1.05V\nPP1V8_S3 = 1.79V\nPP1V2_S5_SMC_VDDC =1.2V\nPP3V3_S0 = 0V\nPPVCC_S0_CPU = 0V\n\nI notice that C5010, C5017, C5002, C5007 and C5008 had corrosion, so I lifted up all of them, and saw that some pads were burnt.

This signal will open load switch U8030 and allow 3.3 S5 to become 3.3V S0. Please have a look at page 59/76 of the schematics and inspect those resistors.\n\nThe laptop should boot even without those caps removed, you can add them later and run jumper wires instead of missing pad/trace). Right now, you need to find out what is happening with necessary voltages. On page 62 you have all power rails. the best is to go through all of them and which are missing (\nPP3V3_S4, 3v3_S3...)"
