            "message": "Hi Repair People.\n\nI'm new here and would appreciate your help. I'm working on an Air 820-00165-a liquid damaged which i managed to power on. Had damange near SMC, battery controller tps 625, 51980a and few other places. Contacts renewed everywhere that needed. The issue is that when i have the battery and charger plugged in not powering on or if i power on on charger and then plug in the battery it turns off the adapter completely. Also i replaced the charging controller which i took out from an old board for parts. Any advice please? THANKS :D"
