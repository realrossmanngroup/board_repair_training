I haven\u2018t replaced C4518 and C4517 yet as they are so close to the PCH.\n\nIn regards to the traces, I traced all 4 SATA signals to their resistors and then capacitors but its not possible to trace them beyond that so a bad PCH or not properly soldered PCH could still in theory be a unlikely cause for this, can\u2019t it?\n\nWhat else to check next?"
