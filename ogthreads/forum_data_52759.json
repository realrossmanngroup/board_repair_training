With the board out, nothing connected, it takes 20V at around .6Amps for the first 10 seconds, then shuts off.\nIn those 10 seconds or so, if I have it in the housing, It shows a battery-low symbol, sounds the charging-chime, and then shuts down.\nAll rails are present in those seconds, up to CPU vcore at .93v.\nI have no clue where to look, does this sound like a BIOS issue?\n\n**EDIT: This is a [B]820-00281-01[/B], sorry got stuff mixed up"
