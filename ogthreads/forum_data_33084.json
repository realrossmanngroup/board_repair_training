            "message": "Hi,\n\nI received this yesterday, see photos attached. Since taking them i have removed 6 shorted caps and ultrasonically cleaned all the crap. I haven't gone any further than this. Wondering at this stage, do i proceed with bothering to fix this, or is it a garbage board? One saving grace potentially for this board is that i have been informed that the battery was dead long before it was exposed to liquid, and it hasn't been plugged in since, so theoretically no power ever ran through the plethora of shorts and corrosion.That said, SMC is living in corrosion so that's probably fucked.\n\nNOTE: I'm not asking for assistance at this stage (though i might do at some point), I'm more asking for opinions.\n\nWhat's your thoughts guys?"
