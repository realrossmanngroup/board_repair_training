            "message": "This is a stupid question but I have a 820-00165 that boots to the OS but strangely loses the trackpad at the login\nscreen.\n\nI was trying to install OS X Catalina on a repaired machine off a USB drive installer that I have used many times.\nThe trackpad works at this point. Its when I get to the language INSTALL screen (i.e where you pick the language to proceed with the install)\nthat the cursor freezes in the upper left hand corner of the screen.\n\nI inspected the trackpad cable and it not good so I replaced it.\nSame issue.\nI am now US cleaning the board as the connector may have some debris in it.\n\nMy question:\n\nWhy does the trackpad work when the machine first starts (power button + option key pressed) and USB drive in place, but stop working when it gets to the language select screen on the Catalina install. I was hesitant to even post this as I though it was surely a software issue that I was dealing with such as an install issue but\nI think it is a hardware issue and the trackpad connector is to blame."
