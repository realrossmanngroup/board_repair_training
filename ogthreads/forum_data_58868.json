Other side is getting 5.15V and 0.32 amps. \n\n\nU3200... and this four components may cause this kind? Before this when it was CD issue i always was getting at least 5V on all ports. \n\nVisual checking on logic board have no issue, nothing burnt. \n\n\nCan T2 fail this way? \n\nNo rails found shorted to ground. \n\n\nOn J3300 when connect there is absolutly nothing on board, no voltage anyware."
