Went back to look over some things and check connectors like you suggested and sure enough, while at first glance all looked good, poking around half of the pins were off the pads on J3401. Not sure if I looked at this board before I got the high powered scope but that thing has certainly paid for itself! It is at least seeing connection in system info, now just have to get it added back in the profile. Reloading OS. Not sure if there was an easier way. When I tried to add the service back in Wifi was not a possible selection. PRAM reset didn't work either."
