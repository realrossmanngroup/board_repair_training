I have a spare 820-00045 board that I can take parts from if need be. \nI searched the serial number of the macbook and it shows that is also an A1534(EMC 2746)\nSerial #: C02QK7XYGF84\n\nFor some reason though it doesn't have the same layout as the other boardview I have and the board view doesn't match. I can see some caps that don't look great but aren't shorted so I want to replace them and hopefully fix this. \nI can't find a board number written on neither of these boards. If these do have a different schem/boardview could someone send this to me.\nHere are images of the board so someone may be able to identify it."
