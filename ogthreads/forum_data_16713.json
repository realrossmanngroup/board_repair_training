After a few days i tried to boot up but no backlight. Ended up replacing l8550 , but shadowing is occuring under the screen.\nChecked all resistors to lvds and they are all reading correctly. The lid, i tested smc_lid circuit and everything seems to check out ok. I am definately at a lost on this one."
