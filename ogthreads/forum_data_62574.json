            "message": "Hi,\nBoard is water damage, most corrosion was in the little caps around the XA/XB USB port connector. Also C3101 was looking nasty, I replace the caps, no shorts detected, just ugly caps.\nWhen I plug the original charger with an amp meter I get steady 5.11V in XA port. XB port pulses 5 seconds in 5.11V then goes to 0V for 1 second and up to 5.11V. Ports on the other side do the same.\n\nI replace U3100, but keeps doing the same.\n\nPP3V3_G3H = 3.39V\nPP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO 3.36V\nPP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS= 5.11V\nPPDCIN_G3H = 5.12V\nUPC_XA_GATE1 = 11.01V\nUPC_XA_GATE2 = 7.18V\nPP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOA = 1.77V\nPP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOD = 1.79V\npp1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC =1.11V\n\nShould I replace U3100 again or look for something else?"
