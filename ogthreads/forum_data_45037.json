Display doesnt light up, there is 8.57v on the fuse but not boosting, but display not turning on at all so it seems. Tried PRAM reset nothing happens. Tried to boot with external drive on external display, nothing happening. External drive and mouse have led activity.\n\nHistory was I repaired it about a month ago, short on C7319 but that looks all good, no short and power is working."

As for display circuit no voltages, only get 8.59 on fuse but voltage for J8300, 3, 4, 14, 15, 16, 18/19 all 0. Cannot find any shorts in display circuit, seems its not turning on? Should have at least 8.59 on pin 3-4 i guess unless the line is broken, but no short."
