            "message": "I have a macbook air with a glitchy power issue. There was light water damage on the keyboard and ever since then it seems like something is triggering the power button. I keep getting notification asking if im sure that i want to shut down and display will turn off as if power button was pressed. All keyboard keys work fine. Before i deem it a faulty keyboard id like to know if its possible that it may be something with u5010 and the circuit around it. Reason i ask is because i noticed using the smc power pads would not turn the macbook on. Only when i plug in the charger it will turn on. I did however manage to get the power pads to turn it on once i believe and on occasion the power button will work. Also when i unplug the keyboard i stop getting those power off messages and mac stays on with no issues after.\n\nany advice appreciated."
