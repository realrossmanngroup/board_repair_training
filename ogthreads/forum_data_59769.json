            "message": "So to cut a long story short one of my colleagues went to change the keyboard on an A1708 macbook, ripped the touchpad cable in the process. We have replaced the touchpad cable but the touchpad is still not functioning. So we got another touchpad cable - same. We have then replaced the touchpad itself and yet same behaviour - the touchpad wont move but will occasionally click. Keyboard does work however - it didnt work with the original ripped trackpad cable. \n\nF4800 is fine, i'm really not sure where to go with this - i've had two trackpad cables from the same supplier neither are working with either the old trackpad or a new one. I don't have any known good other machine to test it on  but other than trying with yet more trackpads and trackpad cables from other suppliers i'm not sure if theres anything on the board which may have burned with the ripped cable?"
