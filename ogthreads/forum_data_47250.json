            "message": "This board is switching between 3.3V and 0V on P3V3S0_EN (from PM_SLP_S3_L).  It will work fine and the screen will come on and then next time I turn it on it will have no P3V3S0_EN (no PM_SLP_S3_L) and 3V3_S0 gets stuck at 1.9V. The only damage I can find was on the via leading to R8319. I fixed that. I replaced U8030 just to rule that out. There are no shorts that I can find. Everything is measuring fine. Is this familiar at all? I'm not sure what's happening with this."
