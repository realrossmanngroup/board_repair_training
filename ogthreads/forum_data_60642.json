            "message": "First post, subscribed to the paid service but not sure if this is where I am supposed to ask my question. \n\nAnyway, I connected faulty electronics to my usb C port, and after an audible crack the laptop started behaving strangely. First of all, it didn't die immediately and continued to work for around 10 minutes before I connected it to a power adapter. When I connected it to a power adapter, it began freezing, so I rebooted it. It rebooted okay but during login it froze again. This happened a few more times before it wouldn't boot at all. \n\nEager to fix it myself, I watched several of your YouTube videos and without any real testing, I removed U700 on the basis that it seemed to be the root of most of the issues with that particular board. The chip number was 645BV which I replaced with a 645AV, convinced they were cross compatible. I verified that the charger bumped to 20V, and reassembled the laptop. Much to my surprise, the laptop booted fine, so I plugged in a usb mouse to make sure that the port was working too, which it was. At this point I gave myself a pat on the back and put the laptop to one side sure in the knowledge that it was working, or so I thought. Fast forward a week and I needed it to do a little work. I opened it up (it still had charge) and logged in, all fine. When I plugged in my USB stick it seemed to work initially and the to my horror, regressed back to freezing and not booting. \n\nThe plot thickens. Since then, I have checked that it pulls a decent current at 20V, indicating it's charging. When connected to power the interior LED illuminates and the processor heats up, indicating to me, a layperson, that the processor is busy or stuck doing something, just not booting. Because it was getting warm I decided to disconnect the battery in case of fire. When I connected the power adapter, with the battery disconnected, it jumped into life booted fine and is working, just with no battery. This seems to me like a big clue as to what's malfunctioning. \n\nIf I had to take a guess as to what it could be, based on my most recent symptoms, I would have thought it was some sort of battery management or power routing IC, but I'm no expert. Perhaps it was hanging on by a thread and the current drawn via the usb stick just pushed it over the edge. Currently it's sitting happily backing up to my time capsule, with no battery and connected to the power adapter. \n\nIs this a common fault? If so where should I be looking and what should the test procedure include? I can provide more information if necessary."
