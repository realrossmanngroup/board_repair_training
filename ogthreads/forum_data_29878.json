            "message": "I got 2 new gpu chips from Duke, 0005, with 1125 date code, i sent a message about this to him but he did not reply so im asking here. We replaced 2 gpu chips, in both case only the gpu is only issue (gpu was reflowed before replacement, and that fixed it), so in both cases what is happening is: after we installed the new GPU chips both laptops turns on with chime, apple logo appears with the loading bar, there is no discoloration or anything which would indicate bad gpu at that point, the loading bar goes up as normal than before it is reaching the end and OSX should load it just restarts. This is the case exactly in both laptops. We figured maybe we did something wring during the new GPU installation, so we reballed the original GPU with leaded balls, installed it back and the laptop works fine, so i guess it is not our method of replacing the GPU.\nOne of the original GPU was 0005 and replaced with a new 0005, but the second one was 216-0810084, but they show exactly the same issue after replacement.\n\nI found something about installing a resistor depending on the size of the VRAM, but on other forums i found that they replaced the 0084 without modification succesfully with a new 0005.\n\nSo at the moment it looks like the chips are bad, but i guess Duke knows very well how to source a good GPU, so i dont know, maybe we are missing something.....\nbtw... one GPU we reballed with leaded solder to avoid high heat (maxc heat was about 195 Celsius), but the second gpu we just left the original unleaded balls on it (max temp was 228 celsius).\n\nAny idea what am i missing?"
