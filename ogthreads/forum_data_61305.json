            "message": "Hello everyone! \nI am new to this forum :) \n\nI have a Macbook Air 820-01958 board. The logic board is actually ticking. ([MEDIA=youtube]pFau91KT0Sw:649[/MEDIA]) same as this. \nSo I am pretty sure the CPU is dead. \n\nI have a question. I am going to swap boards with another macbook air 820-01958 (the only difference is the ssd size 256 vs 512). \nI want to try and keep the same serial number, would swapping the efi/bios chip work in this case? \n\nThank you in advance!"
