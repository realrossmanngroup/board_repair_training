Once i power on the laptop i need to reset pram so it's gonna boot into OS,if i restart it will boot but if i do shutdown on boot after hands with full bar and apple logo. No other damage from liquid and also if i try to reinstall the os with internet recovery or usb and even with new ssd just hangs on apple logo with full bar.\n\nThanks"
