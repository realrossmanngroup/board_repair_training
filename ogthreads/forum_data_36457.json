Known-good trackpad/cable and DC-In board/cable. I'm getting two errors in the built-in test: SMC - PFM006 and camera - PPN001. I've checked every trace, pad and component around the SMC and all are fine. Resistances and voltage-drops to ground are all normal. Not sure where to go next. I attached pre-cleaning pics."
