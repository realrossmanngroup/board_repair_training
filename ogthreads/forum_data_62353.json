            "message": "Hi everyone.\nI got this MacBook 850-01598 to repair and it first came with no power.\nFound liquid on Battery flex cable and some corrosion. The cable was replaced and Mac started and went to the system, but only on the external Monitor.\nChecking the LCD FPC connector from the screen side it also had a bit of corrosion. \nNow I'm not getting backlight and even video. Normally when there is no backlight I still can see very dimmest video on the screen if I use a torch. In this case no backlight and no display.\nTrying to figure out the problem I found that on R5252 I'm getting 1.8V on side 1 and 0 on side 2. The resistor is ok with 100K, so U5250 is not getting Enable signal.\nI'm using the board with only LCD screen connected (New screen).\nI'm a newbie with a bit of knowledge.\nPlease can someone point me in some direction?\nI2C_DISP_LS_EN - 0V\nPP3V3_S0SW_LCD_R - 0V\nR0541 - 0v\nR0540 - 0v"
