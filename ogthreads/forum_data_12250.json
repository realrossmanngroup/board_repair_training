            "message": "I have this 820-3209 board that was liquid damaged around the lp8550 so I removed the it and replaced it as well as all the components around it.\nWith the lp8550 removed i did a continuity test from the feedback pad to the probe(938) as well as from the probe(938) to pin 2 of L9701 and there was no continuity for either one. Also when I measured the output caps in diode mode it measured 0.40v which I believe means the feedback line is broken\n\nI put a new lp8550 on to shove my 36AWG to the feedback ball and run it to the probe(938) but while doing that I ended up ripping the probe point pad. Can I just run the wire from the feedback ball straight to Pin 2 of L9701?"
