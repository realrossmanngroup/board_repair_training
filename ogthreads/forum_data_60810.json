I understand what they are and I understand that all of them up to (and including) xxx_S0 must be at correct voltages.\nNow, If I close the lid, the system goes to sleep and enters state S3, does it mean that all _S0 voltages are going to 0V?\n\nThank you!"

            "message": "I'm sorry, I wasn't clear enough in my previous post. \nWhat I want to say is that according to the schematics, PP3V3_S0 is created from PP3V3_S5 when signal P3V3S0_EN is high, and this enable signal is directly derived from PM_SLP_S3_BUF_L/PM_SLP_S3_R_L after 0 Ohm resistor (essentially fuse). _S5 means that this voltage is present even if laptop is turned off (software shutdown). I know that S0 voltages must exist after all previous _S3 and _S4 are created successfully. I thought PP3V3_S0 will be created directly from PP3V3_S3, but this is not the case, it is created from S5 voltage but only after S3 voltage is present (which is used as Enable signal)."
