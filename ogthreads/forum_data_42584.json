            "message": "Hello!, have a board which is 820-4924-A and was after liquid damage. After cleaning and replacing corroded components board turns on, boots, but won't detect battery and fan at all. So far what I managed to measure:\nPP3V42 - 3.42v\nPPBUS-G3H with connected only battery is 11.04v\nPPBUS-G3H on charger 12.25v\nResistor R5380 - 2.0K\nResistor R5381 - 2.0K\nResistor R5492 is only 148K which should be 200K\nSMC_RESET_L - 3.37v\nPP5V_S3 5.15v\n\nBattery connector under the board was badly corroded (photo before) so can it be that SMC chip needs replacement due to short? Sorry, still pretty unexperienced, hungry for new info, thank you! :)"
