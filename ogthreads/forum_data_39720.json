This board came in previously ultrasoniced by another shop, and the only burned circuit was the U2890 circuit for USBC. The charge ICs were clean! Repaired the circuit now if fires up! Just posting for people working on the newer stuff to give insight on another circuit that can make these a pain and cause you the 5 volt nightmare!"
