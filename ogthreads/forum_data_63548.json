            "message": "Hello, I have an 820-02020 M1 machine here with 5V and taking .450mA. This board has a ton of corrosion everywhere, some of which I have cleaned up. I have replaced the ISL9240. Currently, U8100 gets warm, but not burning. It sits at 40C under thermal cam. PPBUS_AON and PP3V8_AON both measure at 8.2V I know this isn't correct, but I am unsure HOW they have the same voltage values. The same behavior is exhibited in the enclosure. Corrosion hit the backlight circuit area, as well as left speaker area and keyboard and trackpad connector area. No liquid was found on or near U8100. Im a little lost on where to go from here. PPBUS_AON is 250 ohms to ground. diode mode is 0.145 when it should be around .500."
