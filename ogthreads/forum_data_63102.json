Sometimes after many SMC resets it will load OS to user screen or opens boot drive selection, but for most of the time there is only Apple logo. Board has no signs of liquid or other damages. I suspect bad BIOS, could you please share clean one for this board? Or at least clean ME in mine (link below)?\n\n\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://drive.google.com/file/d/190Zr367kxh1eGChRnHdqqzVw67BuuIg0/view?usp=sharing[/URL]"

If I remove SSD I'm able to get to boot menu, but if I will try to run test OS it will get stuck on Apple logo or black screen."
