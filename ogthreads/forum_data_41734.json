Everything seems to work well except the back left USB-C port does not charge the battery or power the computer, though it works fine as a data port.\nThe other 3 USB-C ports take a charge and operate normally.\n\nI'm assuming this has something to do with the PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS?\nI've checked the bank of relevant caps around it and resistance seems fine. tried another I/O board, no change.\n\nAny idea what the usual suspects are for USB-C charging issues?\n\nMany Thanks"

I have found that a partially bad CD3215 will allow ports to work except the one that it corresponds with. Take at U3100 and U3200 for any signs of corrosion or bad components. Diode mode the PP3v3_G3H rail as well as the LDO rails near each CD3215. My guess is either U3100 or U3200 will have a low reading for PP3v3_G3H near the chip."

Any other tricks or techniques?"
