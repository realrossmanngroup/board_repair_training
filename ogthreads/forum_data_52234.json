            "message": "Have this 3787 in that i'm a bit out of ideas for.\nIt is doing the random shutdowns, often times losing video (but backlight stays on) and staying on like that for a little while before shutting down.\nI have replaced all FDMF6808's with 6708N i ordered from digikey (so no sanded down ali-shite)\nAfter testing it at first seemed to be stable, but just now after 4 hours of no shutdowns, it started doing the same thing..\n\nAnyone have any new ideas for this one? It looks similar to the 3332-U8900 symptoms: black screen and then shutdown, but i think the U8900 is not often the issue on these boards, is it?\nI don't like no-fixes so i thought i'd check with you guys first before giving up"
