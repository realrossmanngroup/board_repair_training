            "message": "Hi, 820-00687-A died when closing bottom cover after successful repair (hall sensor on keyboard).\nFirst it had 20v 0a only on one side of usb-c. After replacing U3100 (from ssd dead board CD3215C00 same markings) got 20v 0a on both sides of the cable.\n\nPower rails:\n8.69v PPBUS_G3H \n20.06v PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H\n8.7v PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS\n20.06v PPVBUS_LIO\n20.4v PPDCIN_G3H\n3.31v PP3V3_G3H\n3.31v PP3V3R3V0_AON\n5.06v PP5V_G3H\nPP5v_S5 = 5.0v\nPP3v3_S5 = 3.32v\nPP3v3_SUS = 0v\nPPVCORE_SUS_PCH = 0v\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU_PH1 & PH2 0.00v\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0v\n\nWhat also found (before, without and after CD3215C00 replacement):\nUSB_EXTA_P/N - SHORTED TO GRUND\n\nDoes this means that PCH is dead? Tested with 3 different dc cables, 2 chargers, 3 cables.\nThanks in advance."
