I've reflashed a clean ME and also a complete BIOS. Still not powering up. \n\nHere are the readings i have so far:\n\nPP3V3_G3H: 3.4\nSMC_RESET_L: 3.4\nBUF_SMC_RESET_L.: 3.4\nPPBUS_G3H: -0.13 (yeah these readings were erratic. I confirmed on oscope, it is generating negative voltage). On one instance, i had 0.3V reading. \nPPBUS_G3H Diode mode: 0.43\nTBA_VDDA: 5.2\nTBA_VDDP: 5.2\nPP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC: 0\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC: 0\n\nAny suggestions."
