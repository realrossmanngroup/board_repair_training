The fans started spinning fast after i assembled it back.\nran asd and it showed \nta0p\ntc0p\nth0p\ntm0p failed smc i/o.\n\ni have replaced u5511 and checked all the resistors but everything looks fine, i even compared values of q5520, q5510,q5515 with working board and they all are same but fans are constantly spinning on high rpm.\nr"
