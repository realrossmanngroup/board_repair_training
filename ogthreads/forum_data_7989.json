            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nI've a 820-2879 here with a power problem.\nThis one is not liquid damaged. Lot of dust in the computer, but no liquid damage.\nThe problem is that it turns on sometimes and it works ok, but lot of times it won't turn on.\n\nSome measurements:\n\nWhen it's not turning on:\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.55V but goes down and up.\nPP3V3_S5 - jumping between 3.3V - 1V\n\nSometimes everything goes down to 0V and stays there until I disconnect and reconnect the charger.\n\nSMC crystal is oscillating. \n\nI changed U7200 I thought I've a problem with the PP3V3_S5 line.\n\nThere is no short on PP3V3_S5 nor on PP5V_S3\n\nAny idea?\n\nThank you!"

PPBUS_G3H goes up to 12.56 it's there for 2 sec and collapse.\nI believe the problem is that the PP3V3_S5 rail is all over the place. There is no short on the 3.3V rail.\nHowever if I heat the board just a little bit everything is fine, but when it cools off the problem comes back.\n\nI checked the traces to q7220 all seems ok."
