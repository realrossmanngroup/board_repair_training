Actually it looks really clean.\n\nHowever I noticed that if everything is plugged it gives me 5.15V on the power cord amp meter PPBUS = 0v. \n\nIf I unplug that cable which connects the sound and I guess the power button to the board itself it goes to 20V. PPBUS_G3H = 12.58V\n\nHowever no image on the screen, no fan spin, and no external image.\n\nCould it only be to replace the power button?\nDoes this model of logic board do not have auto power on? First time with this brand new model."
