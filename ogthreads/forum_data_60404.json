            "message": "Hallo everybody,\n\nI got another problem with a MacbookAir (820-3032-A).\nIs seems to get in S0 state (taking 300 mA) but not powering on. I noticed that ALL_SYS_PWRGD is missing so i checked the needed rails and found PP1V05_S0 beeing low (0.22V).\nSo I checked where PP1V05_S0 (resp. PPCPUVCCIO_S0_REG) is created and found Q7630.\nI coudl measure the fallowing voltages for Q7630:\nPin         Voltage\n1/2            8.4\n3               0.28\n4               0.26\n5                 0\n6/7/8       0.22\n\nCan anybody help me with some hints for further steps?\n\nThank you and best regards\ndudipupan"
