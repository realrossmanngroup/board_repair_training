If board was working fine prior to drop, and then stopped after the drop, it's very, very likely damage inside board or underneath CPU/PCH/RAM/etc. You can try a new BIOS...but probably not going to help anything. Check and make sure nothing got knocked off the board near SPI ROM, etc. \n\nThis one will probably not be worth the time. :("
