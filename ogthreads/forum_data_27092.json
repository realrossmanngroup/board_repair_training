Because you're getting a green light so the SMC is atleast doing something.\n\nYou can't really properly conclude if the SMC is working based on the PPBUS_G3H voltage since your measurements haven't been the most accurate so far. Making it unsure if we're just looking at a lower PPBUS voltage or a inaccurate reading. (Are your batteries in your multimeter in need of a replacement?)\nYou can try to reflow it I guess, though.\n\nWhat are the voltages of: PP3V3_S5, PP5V_S5, PP3V3_S4 now?"
