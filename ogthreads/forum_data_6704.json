            "message": "Hello. After replacing a SATA connector that was broken by a coworker on a 2009 Mac Pro Backplane Board, I had noticed I knocked off a small component. If the name is similar to that of the MacBook line, I believe it to be a capacitor (It's either C8180 or CB180; not sure, the text is a bit hard to read). It's apart of the SYS_RESET circuit (also writing on the board)\n\nThis would be a trivial replacement, however, I can't find the component anywhere I've looked, and I have no schematic for this board in particular... Searching for a schematic to buy can't be done because I'm not the store owner. I was wondering if by chance any of you guys and/or girls would happen to have the schematic and know the , or a means to figure out the capacitance of the would-be capacitor that is missing (Still a noobie, basically an apprentice at this job)?\n\n\u200bThanks in advance for the replies.\n\nWill attach a photo."
