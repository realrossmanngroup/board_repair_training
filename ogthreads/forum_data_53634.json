I have one on the bench now. \nMy plan is to just shotgun but wondered what others have done about this.\n\nWhen it fails the LED voltage is 17-20v and is slowly fading away.  \n\nHas anyone else fought this one?"

Then it worked. \nLP8550 looked good \"perfect\" looking under it. I checked all the sides with the scope.   There is no water damage on the back side of the board.   Via is good no corrosion damage."
