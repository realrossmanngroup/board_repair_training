            "message": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have a macbook air here, history unknown but I think someone tried to do something on it before. It looks like someone tried to reflow the memory modules but used a way too low temperature and no flux (The plastic around the modules are slightly molten but not enough to say they used more then 200C). Other then that nothing else seems to be touched\n\nThe system sometimes shows the 3 beeps and doesn't boot, sometimes it crashes while playing the chime sound (Which makes for some really loud and scary audio glitches!) or sometimes it just works for 2 to 10 minutes before the video glitches and the system freezes. The freezes do not appear to be temperature related and its just luck if it will keep on working. The system always crashes after a while and crashes faster if the memory is being loaded (memory testing etc.)\n\nThe voltage of the memory modules is at a stable 1.500V\n\nI tried reflowing the modules with flux and waited until they floated on the solder before I moved on to the next chip. This only seemed to have made the issues worse and now it crashes way more often, I can usually only get up to 3 minutes or it shows 3 beeps at POST.\n\nMy bet is on a bad module somewhere. I currently don't have a lot of devices to work on so I'm alright with replacing the modules if that's what's needed.\n\nSo What modules should I buy? I prefer pre-balled or new ones as it would save me on time it takes to ball them.\n\nEDIT: Here are a couple of pictures of when the device froze\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\tIMG_20171001_175119.jpg Views:\t1 Size:\t573.1 KB ID:\t26198\"]26198._xfImport[/ATTACH][ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\tIMG_20171001_173420.jpg Views:\t1 Size:\t328.1 KB ID:\t26199\"]26199._xfImport[/ATTACH][ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\tIMG_20171001_174305.jpg Views:\t1 Size:\t474.4 KB ID:\t26200\"]26200._xfImport[/ATTACH]"

Also the video is still and not moving around with random patterns (As more common with I/O disruptions)\n\nAlso I've managed to make the issue worse by pointing my hot air at the memory ICs which could show the issue is with one of the chips.\nSince the system detects this as \"two memory banks\", would it be possible to remove one half and see if that does something?\n\nObviously it says nothing if the CPU is still screwing up the memory, but memtest is able to find issues just in a couple of seconds\n[ATTACH alt=\"Click image for larger version  Name:\tIMG_20171001_225934.jpg Views:\t1 Size:\t151.6 KB ID:\t26206\"]26206._xfImport[/ATTACH]\n\nEDIT: Started memtest another time and it failed on exactly the same second, percentage in the same region of memory.\nIs there a way of finding out what module is part of this region?\n[ATTACH]26208._xfImport[/ATTACH]"

Really sorry to bother but could I in theory remove the B side of the memory?\n\nMuch appreciated\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust looked up it and both the 2nd and 3rd generation Intel mobile processors can work in Single Channel mode and this happens when either Slot A or Slot B is populated. So I was wrong earlier and removing Bank A should've done something. So unless apple did something in the firmware to prevent running the system without both banks populated I'm not sure whats up. (Also I think the 3 beeps is too low-level to be easy to re-program by apple? Might even be hardwired)\n\n[USER=\"624\"]Alan.L[/USER]  You sure you removed the right modules? Maybe Bank B contains the messed up part?"
