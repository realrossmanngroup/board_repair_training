I've seen the lowered DC-In voltage happen on these boards with standard component failures and shorts but I'm wondering what else might cause it. Any idea where to look next on this? I'm not finding anything off. C3100 and C3108 were damaged and barely hanging on so I replaced those. I included pictures before I cleaned it but I received this board after it was already mostly cleaned so the clues aren't obvious."

I can't find anything else off on this. I've compared every component in the CD3215 areas to a functional board and there's nothing else that's measuring incorrectly. The only thing I can find is that the pad for PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO is disconnected and not measuring anything but all the other points on PP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO are measuring fine. I attached a picture of the pad I'm talking about. That's it."

Also, I forgot to mention that R3110 was blown and I switched it before my last post. No change after replacing it, but that line obviously got hit pretty hard.
