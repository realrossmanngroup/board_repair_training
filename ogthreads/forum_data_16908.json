The light on the charger stays green and it doesn't turn on when I hit the power button or when I short the onoff pads.\n\nHere are some measurements I took before replacing the U7200 chip.\n\nCHGR_DCIN 16.35 \nCHGR_ACIN - 4v\nPPBUS_G3h - 12.58\npp3v42_g3h- 3.41v\nResistance Pins 17/18 U7000 - 2.9ohms\nResistance Pins 27/28 U7000 - 20.2ohms\nu5010 voltages were all fine. \nshorted smc_onoff_l to ground and saw the voltage go to 0v on u5010 but still doesn't turn on\nU7200 (Pin 1 - 0v - Pin 6 - 0.78v - Pin 16 - 12.58v)\nSMC_PM_G2_EN - 3.4v\n----------------------------------------\n\nQ7221 was showing 3.38v on pin 2 and 0v on the drain Pin 6 so I replaced the TPS51125(U7200) \nThere was still 0v on Pin 1 of U7200 so I replaced Q7221. Still made no difference.\n\nI then checked Pin 16(VIN) of U7200 and noticed it wasn't a stable 12.58v. PPBUS_G3H starts off at 12.58v and quickly goes down to around 5v then jumps back up to 12.58v and repeats. I even took the TPS51125 off of the board and measured and PPBUS_G3H still does the same thing. \n\nWhat could be causing this?"
