            "message": "This board had a small amount of liquid damage around the SMC area and in that area on the other side of the board I replaced several components around that area and have ultrasonic'd the board. \nInitially I started by replacing Q5030/50, R/C5329, C4901/20, R5488/89, C5489\nC/U6901, C7782, U7780, R2460/65, C7781\nAfter replacing all those the board was just pulsing and not turning on. I then replaced U7760 and then the board started turning on and the heatsink got warm.\n\nAfter assembling there was no chime or video on the screen but the fan spun and I was able to turn the machine on and off with the keyboard. I did an SMC and PRAM reset but that didn't help.\n\nI measured PPVCORE_S0_AXG and PPVCORE_S0_CPU but I only get about 0.017v.\n\nThe entire U7400 area is spotless and R7402/03 measure the proper resistance  and that is from the resistor to the pin on the chip so I made sure the traces are fine.\nU7400 Measurements\nPin 1 - 0.53v\nPin 48 - 0.64v\nPin 47 - 3.29v\nPins 46, 29, 19 - 5v"
