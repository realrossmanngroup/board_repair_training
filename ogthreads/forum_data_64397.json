            "message": "Hi to you all :)\n\nI got a 820-02098 board with no liquid and in really nice condition (not even dust) that just died during a Word document according to the client.\nI get 5v and 0.000A on the charger...\nI have no knowledge about this board (all new to me) but this is what I have so far\nPPDCIN 5.195 v    diode mode-0.557\nPPBUS_AON -0.322.      diode mode- 0.035 , resistance to ground 34ohm\nPP3V8_AON 0v.    diode mode-0.153\nPP1V8_AON 0v.     diode mode -0.443\nPP5V_S2_MAIN  0v  diode mode -0.395\n\nNo big coils have the same resistance to ground as PPBUS_AON , mostly around 300 ohm....\nAny help is highly appreciated"
