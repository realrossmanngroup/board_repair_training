            "message": "This board had liquid damage only on the bottom side of the board from the lp8550 across to U1950.\nI replaced the following components initially to see if I could get it working.\nU1950 + surrounding resistors/caps, Q8150 + resistors below it, C6100, U1900, C1910,\nC5010/17, C5002/07/08, R5177/78/79/80.\n\nAfter replacing all those it still wasn't turning on then I found out the trace from the R6120 to R6110 was gone so I ran a wire from R6110 to Probe 750 and that repaired the trace and the board turned on and the Cpu got very warm so I turned it off and UC'd the board. I then realized there were damaged components I didn't replace so I replaced\nC3510,U3510, C3280 + surrounding caps and most of the caps/resistors around the LP8550.\n\nAfter all that I turned the board on and the fan spin but the cpu doesn't get warm at all and there is no chime. PPVCC_S0_CPU is 0v while all the main power rails are present including ALL_SYS_PWRGD, PM_PCH_PWROK.\n\nUpdate: Right after making this post Vcore came back and CPU_VR_EN was 1.05v. I assembled the machine and it turned on and booted to the login screen but then the screen went blank and the keyboard backlight stayed on. I shut it down and now when I turn it on it doesnt boot or chime but the fan spins for about  4 seconds, stops, then spins again continuously. Not sure what could be causing this intermittent issue."
