            "message": "Hey Guys, I have a water damage mac book pro that came in completely dead with a fainted green light. I was able to make it turn on by removing the short on PP3V42_G3H. Now when the computer boots up it flashes a question mark non stop. I already tried a new HD cable but I'm still having the same problem. The area around J4501 and U4510 looks pretty clean; no signs of corrosion. I have attached a image of the areas that got affected by the water damage. As you can see, most of the damaged occurred near the firewire and T29 boost circuitry.\n\nAny suggestions? \n\nThanks for the help!!"

Is there a bootable OS on the HDD?\nBoot from USB drive and install a known good HDD and see if it is recognized.[/QUOTE]\n\n\nThanks for your response Duke. When I boot from a usb drive and install on a known good HDD, I get the following error \"OS X could not be installed on your computer-File system verify or repair failed. Quit the installer to restart your computer and try again\". It's weird the disk gets listed during installation. It also appears on disk utility. I already tried a HDD with a bootable OS. I also hear the hd spinning. Any suggestions? Should i be focusing on certain lines? Thanks!"

I tried setting the date to todays date and reinstalling the os but i still got the same error. At this point, im not sure if i should spend more time on this since the customer only paid me to fix the dead board. Shouls i let him figure this out Whats your opinion? I also noticed the t29 boost circuitry area gets extremely hot. Should i bother fixing this circuitry? Thanks!"

Should i bother fixing this circuitry?  What do you think i should about the installation problem? Should i let the customer figure that on his own?"

Do you think its acceptable to return the board to this customer at this point? Everything works properly it just gives me that stupid error \"OS X could not be installed on your computer-File system verify or repair failed. Quit the installer to restart your computer and try again\". \" \n\nThanks!"
