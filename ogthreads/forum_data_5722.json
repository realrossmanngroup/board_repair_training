Repaired the Onewire circuit and got green light.\nWhen I now try to boot, the MBP reboots halfway through the loading process. It acts the same with both SATA and USB.\n\nASD EFI shows no errors.\n\nWhen I try to install from USB stick the loader bar goes to around two thirds and just hangs, tried both Yosemite and El Capitan.\n\nAnyone seen this before? Bad MCP?"
