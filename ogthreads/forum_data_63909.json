I got a schematic and boardview for a close model. location of the parts on the board are a bit shuffled, but schematic ics seem to match. Here link to the Schematic and Boardview -  [URL='https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqUpFIbofx3Hl5wJE05zzzeM_VvZdA?e=bqp3bc']Lenovo FLEX 5-14ALC05 \u2013 LC56-14A SVT[/URL]\n\nI got two of these, both have been connected to the same (doggy?) usbc, which blew them one by one. \nI have detected a short on the 5V line and traced it down to U7204 (which was glowing at 1V over 5V line). Replaced it, and the short is gone. However, I cannot get 3.3 and 5V lines to fire up.\n\nPU4501 is heating up slightly and was dropping the DCBATOUT voltage from 19 to 9 V. After replacement, it now stays at 19V with no drop.\nNow still slight heat signature on PU4501 bench shows 19V/0.04A\n\n\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"1149px\"]61161[/ATTACH]\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]61163[/ATTACH]\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]61162[/ATTACH]\n\nPU4501/4551, same voltages\nP1 - 4.5V\nP2 - 19V\nP6 - 0V\nP9 - 0V\nP11 - 4.7V\nP12 - 0V\nP13 - 0V\nP14 - 0V\nP15 - 5V / 2.7V\nP17 - 5V"

            "message": "Yes  TPS51393 for sure, but I had one from the donor board, which is the other failed board. So how reliable not sure. And I don't have this chip. \n\nI would have thought that 5V and 3.,3 fire separately. Could missing both voltages at the same time would be still faulty TPS51395/3\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" alt=\"1684710780702.png\"]61164[/ATTACH]\n\nHow can you spot which component is it without an accurate boardview? Seems to be a bigger size one? 0603?\n\nOnly one in that package size seems to be missing on the left of D2502.\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]61166[/ATTACH]\n\n3D3V_RTC_AUX - 3.3V\n3D3V_AUX - 2.7V\n\n\nRemoved the Diode (if that is the one) and I get 2.70 on 3V3V_AUX_S5 and lost 3D3_RTC_AUX which was 3.3V with the diode."
