            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nThis one looked like it took a dive in an orange juice bucket. I UC it and then there was no green light. I looked around and SMC_BC_ACOK was missing while PP3V42_3GH was ok. The problem was U7100 which I replaced and voila there is green light and the CPU gets hot.\n\nI now half assemble the laptop to check if there is image and here is what happens. When I plug the magsafe in there are all voltages present on the motherboard at all coils and the screen shows an empty battery with a bolt (like in iPhones) for few secs - no fan spine - and it then turns off (along with all voltages except S5 voltages and PPBUS_G3H at 12.5 to 12.6V). That happens every time I reconnect the magsafe.\n\nHas this macbook turned into an iPhone? Should I hook a sim card? Other ideas?\n\nbr,\ngeorge"
