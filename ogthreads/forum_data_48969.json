            "message": "Hi guys, I have an 820-3332 with no light on the magsafe. Some small corrosion around Q6896. I check PPBUS as well as PP3V42_G3H and they both have 0v, no shorts. If I check on F6905 i get 0.470v. Tried another Magsafe, and another charger but same. I know how to troubleshoot onewire, but that seems not the issue as I dont even have DC-IN power, or am I missing something? If i.e. U6990 or U7000 are not OK would the Mac not even get DC-IN power? All IC in charge circuit look good. Please enlighten me."
