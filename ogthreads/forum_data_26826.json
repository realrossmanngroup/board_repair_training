Have green light that turns orange. Any ideas what would cause the 10 second fan spin? its not 1/4 fan.  BTW it didnt even do the 10 second spin until i replaced those components."

I couldn't classify that as 1/4 fan spin though for obvious reasons.\n\n3.3V on 3v3_s5\n3.42 on PPCRTC... \n\nwhere would I check for power cycling? It has a green light and switches to orange if thats what you mean."

In an effort to become not so dumb, how would one know its a \"termination\" resister or a \"pull up\" resistor?  \n\nSide note, this one does actually run for 30 seconds before it shuts down. \n\nVCORE is present\nno corrosion around U1900 or U1950"
