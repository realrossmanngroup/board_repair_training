            "message": "I have an 820-3115 board that originally had liquid damage. Repaired several areas of the board, including a shorted C7523 cap. Board ran well for 5 passes of ASD and 72 hours of manual testing. Worked fine for customer for a few days, then was returned because it wouldn't power on. Found C7523 was shorted, removed/replaced and board was back up and running. Ran fine for 3 days, returned to customer. Ran fine for another few days, and stopped again. C7523 was shorted out again. I can replace it and the board will work again, but what would be causing it to short out every time? I can't detect any anomalies when the board is repaired/working, everything works well.\n\nAny ideas, duke?"
