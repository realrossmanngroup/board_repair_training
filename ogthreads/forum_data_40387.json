Or is\nthere something else that could keep the backlight from being enabled?\nI checked the trace from pin 5 on Q7707 to R1470 and it is 2.3 ohms which seems a little\nhigh but there is continuity. I can't see anyway to check the trace to the cpu. Pin 2 on R1470 is also zero.\n\nHistory it was liquid damage mainly around the lcd connector which was shorted and replaced along with backlight fuse. Have 8.6v at fuse output now."
