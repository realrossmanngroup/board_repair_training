            "message": "The PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS is supposed to be 20V the moment the USB-C power is connected to port A. But instead of 20V, there is only 5.16V.\nLooking at the schematics, by design, there is no circuit connected on the PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS that can change/control the voltage from 20V to 5.16V.\nThis means that the problem must be on PP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS (9 decoupling capacitors, D3300, D3301, inside U3100 or inside Q3100). The problem cannot be after the Q3100 (N-MOSFET), meaning the problem cannot be on PPDCIN_G3H or the circuits on that bus.\nDo you think my logic is correct?"
