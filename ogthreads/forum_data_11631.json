            "message": "Hello,\nthis time im working on an 820-2915-B that starts but wont boot up. The screen stays black and it beeps 3 times. I tried different RAM but it did not work. So i measured PP0V75_S0_DDRVTT which should be 0.75V i guess but is is 1.3V. Can this cause the problem? If yes i guess a resistor is blown somewhere because this would explain a higher voltage (a bad cap would short/lower it instead as far as i know). So i measured all resistors on this power rail and all seem to be fine. Just R3250 is 11OHM instead of 10 but i guess this is fine too. NO i dont know what to do next.\nThank you for any help.\nFelix"

Sorry for the dumb Question. When talking from the 1.5V bus you mean SMBUS? Should i replace all resistors on that line to be sure they are fine?
