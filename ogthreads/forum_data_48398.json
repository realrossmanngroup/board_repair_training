            "message": "When I first got this Mac it sometimes had a chime and came on but it would cycle to black screen and them would display login screen.  I shined a light on screen sometimes it would just be backlight not coming on, but the next time it would be no display at all.  I didn't do anything to it beside testing a few points.  It got worse where now it doesn't chime or display at all.  Board looks clean but only little spot of corosion I could see was pin 1 on U7400 and u2600.  Don't usually work on mac's and not a lot of time so thought I would see what you pro's thought.  Thanks"

But while testing now it is .00 volts and charger light is still green but dim.  With the PPVCORE_S0 rail shorted is it safe to put power supply on 1 volt and try to find short or is there risk to the cpu.?  PPBUS_G3H is 12.58 V,    PP5V_S0 is  5.07v  Thanks  I know this board isn't really worth the trouble but it is to me for learning.  Thanks  Also how do you start in SMC bypass mode.  I know I need to fix the short first but...."

            "message": "sorry I checked their traces and continuity to U7400  and resistors measured good.  I don't have any replacement parts on hand so trying to just troubleshoot and order parts.  So when I first got my hands on it.  The computer would chime and come on but would go from start screen to black screen.  Then after having on longer it got worse and wouldn't chime.  So Im guessing the longer it is on whatever was partially failing when all the way out.  there is some sings of water around Q7510 and Q7520.  But not much.  I tested u7400 and pin 47 should be the enable pin and and it has 3.3 volts on it.  and pin# 46 VCC has 5 Volts on it and pin 29 VDDA and pin 19 VDDB has 5 Volts   So it has power and is being told to turn on.  But Im not sure which pin to test that are to tell Q7510 and Q7520 to make the 1.05 rail.  That is if I have all this right.   Thanks again."
