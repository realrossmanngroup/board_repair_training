When AC adapter is attached, sleed LED lights and fan spins for a quarter-second, then rests. Board does power on in SMC bypass mode.\n\nBoard had corrosion near the ISL chip, specifically northern part of chip and above components--cleaned with IPA and resoldered to remove corrosion on pads--nothing. 3v42 is stable, however rails such as SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL and SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SDA phase up to ~3.475 and then down to ~3.445, seesawing back and forth. Should I try replacing ISL?\n\nMeasured the resistance of the northern components that had some corrosion against a good board, all checked fine."

Diode mode shows very low readings for all three, however, I'm thinking of replacing that capacitor. At first I thought the traces could be corroded between ISL and C7050 due to the corrosion there, but when I jumped wires the issue got worse instead of better (dim blinking amber magsafe instead of solid green but no power), so I removed them.\n\nI've noticed my pin 8 is also showing very low, usually it's supposed to be around 2v but it's showing something much lower, I believe around ~70mv. Again, the associated capacitors and resistors to that pin are measuring correctly against a good board. I've noticed a few of my boards have low voltage on pin 8--I'm guessing a related cause?
