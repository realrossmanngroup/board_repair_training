I have replaced Q7335 four times now :(\n\nThe short is worse when the board is warm, 0,010V in diode mode and slowly gets to around 0,100V when somewhat cooled.\nWhen I take Q7335 off the board it immediately measures 0,370V\n\nThe donor boards measures 0,370V before I take the Q7335 off.\n\nIf anyone have any idea what's going on here please tell me."
