Spent 3 days with working with Jason last month to get started (which was awesome, by the way), upgraded all my equipment, and am now working on my first real MacBook board repair. I have a 820-3115 that's been liquid damaged. When I received it, it had no green light. PPVBAT_G3H was showing 0V. U7000 looked pretty bad so I lifted it, cleaned the contacts on the board and the IC, and resoldered. Now I have green light, but no fan. Started checking rails with PPBUS_G3H and found 0V.\n\nIs replacing the SMC the next step? Or am I jumping to conclusions by going straight to the SMC?"

Found the thread that suggests where to find good donor boards and have ordered a bunch. Only donor board on hand had a U7000 that looked even shittier than the one on this board, so I decided to try to reuse it to see what happened. Since I got a green light afterward, I assumed (poorly) that I was getting somewhere with that reused chip. I certainly won't be reusing in the future once I have stuff in stock."

I changed C7050, R7051, and R7052 and now pins 17/18 measure 3.2 ohms.\n\n\n[QUOTE=\"dukefawks, post: 12127\"]Corroded traces in the R7050/51/52 circuit is likely too.[/QUOTE]\n\nTraces seemed fine when I checked the other day, but I revisited that today and found something interesting. Pins 17/18 and 27/28 were shorting. I cleaned up the solder a bit and that fixed 17/18 but not 27/28. With 17/18 no longer shorted, I found that the trace from pin 18 to C7050 is bad, so I jumpered. Strangely enough, after jumpering, pins 17/18 are shorted again, even though solder work still looks good under the scope. Pins 27/28 look good under the scope too, but remain shorted. A check of all pins showed a short on 19/20 as well.\n\nI'm inclined at this point to wait for the U7000 chips and/or the donor boards that I ordered before proceeding further. Seems like there's a good chance I'm just dealing with a shitty U7000, right?"

Should have though that through more.
