            "message": "We got this board in with a green light turning orange but no fan spin. The board was liquid damaged around U7090, the bottom left corner of the board near Q7155, the SMC RESET IC, and BADLY by the ISL6259. Reflowed areas of corrosion and replaced almost any component left of the ISL as well as the ISL itself. I checked each individual pin for continuity throughout the circuit and all was good. Resistance between 17/18 and 27/28 is good both 20 ohm and 3 ohn measurements. The first time I did replace it, the ISL got SUPER hot, and I did not get a green light. I went ahead and replaced Q7180 and the ISL again and now I'm back to square one on the problem with a green light that turns orange with no fan spin and only 1 volt on PPBUS. Measurements below at the ISL:\n\nDCIN: 18 volts\nACIN: 4.48 volts\nBCACOK: 3.3\nRESET_L: 3.3\n17/18: 3.9 ohms\n27/28: 20.9 ohms.\n\nAny and all help is appreciated \n\nThanks"

With just a new Q7180, ISL, and Q7155 my resistance to ground on PPBUS is many kilohms. HOWEVER, when I put Q7130 on the board, the resistance to ground drops to around 0.62 kilohms. I have checked continuity from 6 and 7 of Q7130 to the other side of the board and I get continuity.\n\nIn diode mode with Q7130 on the board:\n\nPin 2: 0.557 on or off the board\nPin 7: 0.128 seems really low compared to donor, normal measurement consistent with donor when off of the board\nPin 6: 0.499 on or off board\n\nI checked my soldering, I have tried a few Q7130's from an identical donor and a few Air boards (don't have anymore Retina boards I can try), and each time I put it on the board, the resistance measurements on PPBUS and CHGR_PHASE go down. I have also replaced C7145 as it looked nasty. No short on that line or any of the lines that I can find unless I put Q7130 on the board. Is there anything else that can be causing this to go low? Don't want to put power through until I relieve that short or I want to know if it normally pulls the resistance down when on the board (doesn't seem like it)."
