Its a 4 USB port MacBook and strangely I'm getting 20v and some current (0.40A before going back to 0A) and on the other side, i'm getting 5v 0.24A constant and on the other 5v 0.24v boot loop.\n\nCould this be the CD3215 which isn't boot looping or as there is a current on the 5v port, be the ROM?\n\nThanks"

So from your expertise knowledge do you think it's the CD3215's (on the 5v non-boot loop) or the ROM. Taking into account that I'm getting 20v on the other 2 cd3215's and 0.24A on the 5v on the other 2."
