            "message": "I?m calling BS on this. If there was actually a cracked ball, it is possible a reball would fix it. However, most of these CPUs imo on the A1534 are dying from complete lack of cooling in the machine. I could be wrong, but the fact they have no fan makes me think it?s just a shit design not meant to last. If the CPU is internally fucked as I suspect from\noverheating, reballing will be just like with 2011 GPUs heat makes it work for a little while then back to dead"
