I noticed that ppbus_g3h with the battery connected went to fuse F7000, that was fine.\n\nAnalyzing the i2c lines of the battery I see that they feed on pp3v3_g3h.\n\nThis voltage comes out of ic U6990.\n\nWhen I measure the input voltage which is PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H I see that there is no voltage.\n\nThis voltage comes from PPBUS_G3H which passes through a resistor R6905, which I measure and there is no PPBUS_G3H voltage, I see that the resistor is a little sulfated. I proceed to change it and find the solution.\n\nThnks!!! [USER=682]@2informaticos[/USER]"
