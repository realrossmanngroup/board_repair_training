            "message": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need some quick advice, please.\nThe MacBook came in with no power. Trackpad clicking and cycling. It has been opened before, presumably by the customer. The screen shield is missing for both the backlight and LVDS connector. There are no obvious shorts under the thermal camera.\nAfter inspection, I found that the L7210/20/30 has a resistance of 0 ohms, whereas on a good board, it should be 73 ohms. PPVCC_CPU_PH1/3/3 is all dead short with 0 ohms.\nI removed the R7210/20/30 to isolate the CPU, and PPVCC_S0_CPU is still dead short. When I inject 0.8V on that line, it draws current, but nothing gets hot under the thermal camera.\nAm I correct in saying that the CPU is dead?\n\nThe customer is desperate for the data.\n\nThanks."
