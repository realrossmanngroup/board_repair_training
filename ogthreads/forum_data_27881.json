I tested the motherboard that has not been damaged by the accident with a working macbook and SSD, board booted correctly and showed apple logo but after less then a minute it showed completely black screen, so I forced the shutdown with CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-POWER. After that the board doesn't chime. Vcore is present but CPU doesn't get hot. I already tried to install another bios with cleaned ME but no change."
