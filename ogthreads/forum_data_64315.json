The customer brought this back to me twice. Each time it was not charging. \n\nAfter visually inspecting, I saw 2 damaged diodes, I did not have the exact ones, but I used a donor board and I tried using the datasheets to match up as close as possible. The 2 diodes were: DZF600 currently has no voltage, and DZF687 fluctuates around 1.2v. \nOther parts replaced:\nU5500 twice\nC5660 \nC5500\nC5508\nC5505\nQ5216 (Purchased from digikey, consulted with an engineer since an exact match was not found, they said this should work).\n\nAll the pads east of CF813 were completley missing, I ran traces/pads to connect them all, RD671 pin 1 has 11.97v along with the traces/pads I replaced.\nC5223 Is getting 5.1v\nPP1V8_S2_CHGR is 1.79v\nI did have the Magsafe light blinking the other day after having reflowed U5500, but because it was blinking, this is why I ended up replacing U5500 twice as I specified above.\nI also had to repair the pad West of UF360 SPI_UPC1_MISO by running a jumper to RF362 pin 2.\nI am losing my mind with this board. Your help is greatly appreciated."
