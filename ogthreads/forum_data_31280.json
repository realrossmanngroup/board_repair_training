            "message": "This board will work fine but the MagSafe light goes off often. The SYS_ONEWIRE will go between 3.3V and 1.3V. J9500 was slightly damaged. After cleaning it, things got a lot better but it will still drop down fairly regularly. If SYS_ONEWIRE is not completing its circuit through J9500 would that cause the voltage to drop like that? Not sure what else it could be."
