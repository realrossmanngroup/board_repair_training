            "message": "Hi guys,\n\nlittle water damage at CD3217 closest to the hall sensor on the side where there are 2x CD3217s together. \n\nCleaned and removed the chip to find out that 3rd ball from the top left (ball 48?) is short to ground (had to remove the other CD3217 to double check although I could also see corresponding the pull-up resistor - no short there). \n\nThis signal according to other schematics (820-01700) is TBT_T_CIO_PWR_EN and in 820-01949 is connected using a 10k resistor to 3.3V_LDO. Also in 820-01949 this signal seems to be independent for all CD3217s while in 820-01700 it is shared for each CD3217 pair and doesn't seem to have a pull-up to LDO.\n\nI assume TBT_T_CIO_PWR_EN is the same pad for all CD3217s in all motherboards.\n\n5V/0.275A at USB-C meter.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n[ATTACH]60156[/ATTACH]"

            "message": "OK I used the thermal camera to detect the partial short of 0.09A of pad 48. It was the Intel Retimer JHL8040R (every CD3217 has one JHL8040R companion), and when removed the short cleared. I soldered back the second CD3217 (good one) I removed at the beginning to take comparison measurements and left out the LD CD3217 and of course the shorted Intel JHL8040R hoping that the board can start or reach 20V without thise. Unfortunately the board keeps going to 5V/0.280A and at this point with the thermal camera I also noticed the T2 gets a bit warm. Not sure if thats normal or T2 is toast and thus game over.
