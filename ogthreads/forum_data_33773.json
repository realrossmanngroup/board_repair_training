            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have a board here that won't power on after a liquid spill. U7650 and Q7660 were badly corroded so I have replaced them. After cleaning the board in the ultrasonic cleaner, the rest of the board looks OK. It's missing PP5V_S4. I'm testing using an original Apple 87W USB type C charger and cable from Apple. Here are the readings I have so far:\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 13V\nPP5V_S5 = 5V\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.3V\nPP5V_S4 = 0V  31K to gnd on that line\n\nSMC_PM_G2_EN = 3.4V\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0V\nALL_SYS_PWRGD = 0V\n\nAny and all advice welcome :)\n\nCheers,\n\nAlex"

I'm sure the problem is related to U7650 but visually it looks fine. I'm going to reflow it with some flux and a bit of solder just incase. I really don't like situations like this where it's not totally clear what the problem and solution was. Thanks a lot for your help :)"
