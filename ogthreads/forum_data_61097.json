I've checked and tidied up the LVDS double checked connectivity there and made sure no pins are shorting together.  L9010/11 look good. Resisters around GMUX check out. Definitely looks like slightly bad or off connection somewhere. Any thoughts?\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59835[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]59836[/ATTACH]"
