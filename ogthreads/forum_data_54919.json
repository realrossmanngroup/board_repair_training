            "message": "Hello I saw a video by Louis that addresses the issue of bricking your Mac when installing Catalina.  My understanding, please correct me if I'm off, is that Catalina leaves a file that is 32bit on a 64bit system.\n\nHere is what I got from the video. Please tell me if I'm off:\n\nMany Macs are being bricked. Apple is deleting solutions on the support page. The actual issue is this.\n\nApple removed 32 bit software in Catalina but kept a 32 bit program for entitlement management on the machine. \n\nThe offending app is located here: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/IMTranscoding.framework/XPCServices/IMTranscoderAgent.xpc/Contents/MacOS/IMTranscoderAgent\n\nSolution(s)\n\nFor T2 Macs.  if you see black screen yet hear power and chime there is a possible fix that has worked.\n\nIf you can get into super user mode (command + S when booting) or Internet recovery mode then use terminal then you could do these commands: \n     disenable root (enter password)      /sbin/mount -uw /      rm -rf /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/IMTranscoding.framework/XPCServices/IMTranscoderAgent.xpc/Contents/MacOS/IMTranscoderAgent          disenableroot disable    Now this only works when you can actually get to a Terminal screen via Super User mode or Internet Recovery. But I'm dealing with a 2015 Macbook Pro that will not get there. I see there is a Medusa tool that can clean ME but can't FlashRom on a Raspberri Pi do the same thing. I already have adapters for the boards.  \n\nI see a post on this forum on how to flash EFI but it seems old.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. When talking about this issue, what is the correct terminology?  Am I working with the bios or EFI or what?  \n\n2. If this is corruption of the BIOS,  Do I just need to clean the ME region to get the BIOS working again? Will Catalina Boot after this is done?\n\n3. Can I do this with FlashRom and a Raspberry Pi?\n\n4. Is the issue actually on the Bios/EFI chip? It looks like from the Directory above the issue is an application in the OS.  Does this application kill the bios/efi (forgive me if I'm saying this wrong) on older than 2016 Macs and is not just as simple as deleting the file? Because I can't get the board to boot from anything. Just goes to question Mark folder after like 30mins"

What I was trying to figure out is would the solution posted above work for non T2 macs but it looks like it doesn't.  \n\nI can find posts here on the forum about Cleaning the ME with MEDUSA  and about how to flash BIOS with Flashrom and Raspberry Pi but are they the same thing? Becuase I can't seem to find a \"how to\" on cleaning the ME region.  Just posts stating that you should. I see some info on how to clean ME on  Ghostly hacks but they don't say how the computer connects to the board.\n\nSo I hope that someone can tell me if I can connect a PC through a Raspberry Pi to the board with the EZ connectors I got from Ghostly hacks and how to do that."

(pic #1)\n\n\n. The EFI Destroyer lite (Ghostly Hacks) uses a Teensy arduino board to with adapters which can access the BIOS. It's used to remove firmware lock.  Much like the SOIC or SOP clip of old, the adapter accesses the BIOS chip through the \"header\" (pic #2) while on the board.  What I can't find is how all of the group here is downloading the BOIS and reflashing known good clean ME BIOS on boards  Again I see posts about MEDUSA but I would love to tinker around and make my own MEDUSA. So I guess I need to ask a more direct question.\n\n1. What tools and software do we use to read and write clean ME BIOS to a 820-00138-a? If you could provide links that would be swell.\n*I've found raspberry pi and SOIC8 POMONA clip and for software FlashRom\n\n2. Is this boards BIOS accessable with SOIC8 POMONA CLIP? Or can I access it through the header with adapters I already have just like what the MEDUSA comes with?\n?\n\nThank you again for all the help. I've run into this issue more than once.  I"
