            "message": "I'm working on a 820-3437 board. It had no green light. After some mesures, I conclued to change the SMC. I did change the SMC : green light, fan spin while the SMC area still warm. But after the board get cool the fan does spin anymore but I still have the green light. So I changed again the SMC, and I still have the same issue after the board get cool. Does somebody has a clue please ?"
