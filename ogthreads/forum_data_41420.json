            "message": "Hi guys i have an 820-3476 that runs off charger, orange and green light. As soon as I have the battery connected the light is off and PPBUS fluctuating between 8-4v. Did replace U7100 just because its easy :P but that didnt fix it ofcourse.Im pretty bad fixing battery related issues, some guidance would be helpful. I did see some melted solder balls around Q7130 as well as Q7520 but have not replaced those yet. Should I just replace them or is there a way to make sure these are OK?"
