But headset not detected anymore on the OS at the top right.\nBut in the preferences it was still not offer to select the internal spearker (audio card), only heaset (AGAIN strarge)\n\nAt R6806, Pin 2: 0V when Pin 1 is high\nRemoved R6806, sound OK on internal Speakers\n\nAny thing you think I can check before I remove J6700 and replace it completely?\n\nRegards"
