            "message": "The MacBook had spilled liquid and the issue is that after some cleaning and replacing C5125 now chimes and display image but no backlight until I close and open again the display.\nAfter that it has backlight but if I close again the display the backlight doesn't go off.\nI couldn't find any schematic so I used from 820-3536 because they are too similar.\n\nPPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT is 49V when I have no backlight and 38V after using a magnet at lid switch and the backlight works.\nR5171 has 3,2V at pin 1 and goes down to 0V with a magnet at lid switch.\n\nSMC doesn't look to have any corrotion and the liquid trace at the top case seems that didn't touch it.\nLID switch also is perfect.\n\n\n\nare there any ASD diags for this model?"
