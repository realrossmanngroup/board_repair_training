Same with known-good screen.\n\nI have ordered a new display flex (the short one screwed to logic board) to eliminate that as I do not have a known good to test with - beyond this is there anything else I should check?\n\nNo visible damage to J8500 or surrounding components\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nChris"

Having left the board overnight it is now stuck at 5V again and won't jump to 20v on either port.\n\nDiode mode on 3v3_G3H is 0.101v so doesn't appear shorted now. Something bizarre going on because I had a 0ohm short to ground there when I last looked the day it wouldnt turn on.\n\nSo bizarre because I literally had it in the OS on an external screen yesterday! \n\nWhat to investigate if its not turning 20v from charger on?"
