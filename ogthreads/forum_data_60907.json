I went ahead and replaced isl9240 and now I get 20v on USB meter but ppbus_g3h only 12.58v for 30 seconds and then drops to 12.26v for 10 seconds. This process keeps repeating.\n\nAny help appreciated.\nThnx"

There are no signs of liquid on the audio/power button board and the flex cable seems fine.  There were some signs of burn marks on one of the pins of the LVDS connector.\nHow do I get it into DFU Mode? Is that the same as SMC by-pass? What should I be getting on PPBus? It says 13v on the schematic."
