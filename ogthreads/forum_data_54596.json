Figured out that the Touch-bar is shorted and if removed allows the machine to get 20v.\nnow it switches to 20v and but displays \"Low battery\" on screen and does not boot.  Just cycles that. \n\nI am pretty new to these boards."

I have the button on the bench and see corrosion on the back switch.  I want to tear it apart but would like input form someone who has been there before me."
