Use your lips to feel the board, at 3.2A something must warm up.\nAlso there are already many failures on this board that suggest a power surge/spike. Looks like extensive damage everywhere. This will be a time waster board, but if you have nothing else to do go ahead.\nI suspect the PCH at this point"
