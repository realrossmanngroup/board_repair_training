            "message": "Hello. Got this board here that has bee cleaned by another store because of liquid damage, so I don't really know where original damage was. After some inspection I found a blown coil, L4004 was gone and so was its pin 1 trace, so I rebuilt it with a wire, there's no shorts I could find. As U3200 area looked a bit bad I decided to replace U3200 as board was not negotiating 20V with charger. I inspected all components around it and everything is measuring good. Before replacing it I was getting 5V, 50mA on all ports except the one corresponding to U3200. After replacement I now get 5V 50mA on all ports. I'm missing PP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC but there are no shorts to GND on it. I'm stuck now. I'm having serious trouble to understand this messy USB-C architecture... I compared BMC diode readings from all ports and all of them give from 0.458 to 0.475, very similar readings, so I think probably all CD3215s are ok."
