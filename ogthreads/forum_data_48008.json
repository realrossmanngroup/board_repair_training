All g3h rails confirmed present \n\nShutdown doesn't occur when flex cable (brand new) is unplugged.  CPU powers and heats up in this state."

I don't understand why though! in the magsafe2 cables there are only two wires so the charger can't be adding any intelligence over what is inside the magsafe port. And my cables were original apple ones! Any thoughts? The board is drawing about 10W with the battery plugged in\nI will plug in a screen over lunch and see whether the back light issue persists.\nthanks."
