The customer says nobody tried other LVDS cable or LCD.\n\nbr,\ngeorge"

GPU is known to be good since it was replaced with new BGA using Fineplacer PICO RS system and was probably the 1xxxth I have done so far - a job where we provide 12 months warranty - only reason I mention this is that for me this is now a routine operation with almost 0% failure rate..\n\nSo my money is on something else taking into account that after replacing the GPU there is no change - and the GPU was replaced since the customer claimed the LCD is working. But as House says, everybody lies and now the customer after some pressure changed his point to \"not 100% sure if it was working I had this machine on a shelf for months\".\n\nHow about the MUX? I know its the culprit sometimes (for green lines) in 2850 but could it fail here, too?"

I did that immediately after receiving it so I did not confirm it. I also checked the dump I took from the BIOS chip and it looked messed up - the serials where found at different offset than expected.\n\nanyway with the new EFI and CleanME it starts, chimes, and no image internally. There is image on the external monitor but only during booting. Fan speeds, voltages etc are normal.\n\n[USER=\"451\"]jgraffis[/USER] I will test R9678. Thanks dude."

            "message": "if done properly it will last - not all chips have issues with the micro-balls between die and substrate. Most machines I have in the field are with more than two years of proper operation since the reball - our policy is one year warranty. With some others I just replace the BGA, Now we can also get newer 216-0810005, year 2016 which are probably even better. I know Louis probably disagrees but don't forget I am using a 70.000euro rework system which at least ensures that everything is done properly temperature-wise. Plus some small tricks up my sleeve.\n\nthis was my main business for the past 5 years, I only got to motherboard level repairs one year ago.\n\nI can also tell you that I reball R9 cards for an Internet cafe chain and you can imagine the beating these cards take. My first one with them was 15 months ago. Plus hundred more examples.\n\nOf course old Nvidias 2007 and 2008 go directly in the bin and replaced with new ones. Those DEFINITELY have bump issues under the die due to high-lead manufacturing process at that time. Eutectic then fixed that. If the old Nvidias work for a while after a reball its because the under-the-die bumps got heated up again but thats short-lived in most cases (i ve seen Nvidia reflow last almost two years in the dreaded ACER systems with the MCP69 diagonal Northbridge&VGA causing bootloop but thats not something you do when you try to have a professional service shop).\n\nSo it seems to work and when there is an issue we go for a new BGA.\n\n:)\n\nNow I run ASD on this mbp15 and it passed but when I started prime95 along with furmark it worked great for half an hour and now the mouse pointer jumps around pretty slowly and any operation takes ages to complete. As a side note the customer has switched to a Samsung SSD."

            "message": "that's not statistically (at least) true - we know reflows last a couple of months (sometimes less sometimes more but you can't tell) and reballing jobs - we usually forget about them. As I said during the 1 year warranty we offer, IF the GPU fails again then we replace the chip with only the cost of the chip itself. I would like to see some X-rays before we can be sure of anything. As engineers if we can't measure or prove we observe but if we can measure then that is indisputable and to check ball joints you use X-rays. Otherwise its mostly speculation.\n\nat the end of the day lets agree that we disagree and also take into account that almost NOBODY is using Finetech's systems for GPU repair. Remember that such rework machines are used in the factory post production of reputable companies (big names you'd definetely recognise)\n\nfinal note - if I was scamming anyone I would definitely have a long queue of unhappy people outside. That's not the case. They tend to recommend us to others. And we bought the rework system 5 years ago.\n\nnow maybe we could focus on that stupid mbp15 - in case you have some ideas or should I just return it?"

Maybe you are right about customers not bothering - but as I said - we offer 1 year warranty. And out of the so many reballs we do during that time, surely some should be coming back.
