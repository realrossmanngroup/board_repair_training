as example, R5015/16 (3115), R5115/16 (00165), R5225/26 (00923), depending by model.\n    Newer models have some kind of switch pads (not populated), marked as RE030/31 (00850), or SWE10 (01521), etc.\n    Just search in pdf for \"ONOFF\"; easy to find them, connected to SMC_ONOFF_L, or PMU_ONOFF_L.\n    In fact, we don't really need to use these pads exactly.\n    Is very easy to solder a tiny wire on the pad corresponding to the signal; just touch any metal plate with it, when you want to simulate power button.\n    Just a temporar contact, of course.\n    When I really need to use it many times, I prefer to solder a small button, with 5-10cm wires.\n\n\n[U]Check PCH's RTC signals:[/U]\n    We reffer to DC signals, not 32KHz, or other PCH clock signal.\n    Intel platforms have 4 typical signals, RTC_RESET_L, PCH_SRTCRST_L, PCH_INTRUDER_L and PCH_INTVRMEN.\n    Newer platforms, may not use PCH_INTVRMEN or/and PCH_INTRUDER_L.\n\n\n[U]Start in SMC bypass mode:[/U]\n- MacBook\n    Press power button, maintain it pressed, connect charger and release the power button after 5-10s, or when the fan starts.\n- iMac, Mac Mini\n    Press and hold power button.\n    Insert power cord (previously removed) and release power button after 5-10s.\n   Then press power button again (shortly).\n    Fan will start with max speed, if succeed.\n    Used to discard SMC sensor problems.\n\n[U]Start in safe mode:[/U]\n    Press Shift key and power button at same time.\n    Can help to diagnose if a problem is being caused by software that loads on boot.\n\n[U]Start the built in AHT:[/U]\n    Press D key and power button.\n    Very useful for the machines from 2015 and newer, as no ASD available since then.\n\n[U]Start from built in recovery mode:[/U]\n    Press Command + R keys and power button.\n\n[U]Start in target disk mode:[/U]\n    Press T key and power button.\n\n[U]Start in single user mode:[/U]\n    Press Command + S keys and power button.\n    Allows you to run terminal commands with full access to the file system.\n\n\n[U]Test in diode mode:[/U]\n    Connect positive probe of the multimeter (red) to ground and touch the test point with black probe.\n    Sometime (rarely) we need to test in reverse direction.\n\n\n[U]Inject voltage to find a short:[/U]\n    Many times we face with short (or very low resistance) to ground in a power rail.\n    Be aware, some CPU/GPUs have very low value as normal; latest CPUs measure like pure short in fact!\n    The fastest and easiest way, is the voltage injection method.\n    Be sure first is safe to inject voltage there; read the forum, if you are not sure!\n    Always start with low voltage (like 1V), and slowly increase (if needed), no more than 120% of nominal voltage of that power rail.\n    We need powerfull lab PSU for this purpose; because sometime, we need to inject more than 10A, with low voltage as 1V.\n    I recommend analog settings, as being easy to manipulate.\n    [URL]https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005002976766661.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.11b47effcRXrlV&algo_pvid=33f608bf-4fba-46ce-8a07-719747a7601d&aem_p4p_detail=202108210908531935426216139200008873722&algo_exp_id=33f608bf-4fba-46ce-8a07-719747a7601d-50&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000023035634267%22%7D[/URL]\n    [URL]https://es.aliexpress.com/item/10000369192918.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.11b47effcRXrlV&algo_pvid=6bb56174-159b-4efc-8d55-957d9476dcbd&aem_p4p_detail=202108210909576465540956096590008878085&algo_exp_id=6bb56174-159b-4efc-8d55-957d9476dcbd-11&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2220000000188269000%22%7D[/URL]\n    These are just examples, search on Internet and choose which one you like.\n    BTW, adjusting output current is not a need.\n\n\n[U]Enter DFU mode, for T2 machines:[/U]\n    Many people complain they can't acces DFU mode following Apple instructions.\n    Here is a link with detailed steps, reported as working.\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://mrmacintosh.com/how-to-restore-bridgeos-on-a-t2-mac-how-to-put-a-mac-into-dfu-mode/[/URL]\n\n\n[U]Check USB activity:[/U]\n    The best and safest way (not cheap)\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]http://www.cmizapper.com/products/usb-tester.html[/URL]\n    The cheaper way, using an USB pendrive with Link LED, like this (just as example)\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://www.ebay.es/itm/PHILIPS-USB-3-0-64GB-SNOW-EDITION-PURPLE-MEMORIAS-FLASH-PERIFERICOS-BLANCO/373426471641?hash=item56f1f3c2d9:g:gwUAAOSwUk5f~jfX[/URL]\n    I use 64GB with preinstalled macOS El Capitan, or 32GB with ASD (12 versions).\n\n\n[U]Disable GPU on some MacBooks Pro:[/U]\n[URL unfurl=\"true\"]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TxGsttypqvqRIfVPmWJi67St50JJqg55/view?usp=sharing[/URL]"
