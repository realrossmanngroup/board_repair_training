In system info it does stating that it has 18 cycle. \nWas wonder if the 87w charger for the A1707 works with the A1706 laptop? I\u2019m about to replace the battery but hate to do it if my issue is due to something new Apple are doing preventing high watt charges from working on the lower watt systems."
