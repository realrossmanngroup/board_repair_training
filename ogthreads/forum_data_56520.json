(after a few seconds during boot , or after 10-15 minutes of normal use with no issues).\n\nNo liquid damage boards looks perfect.\nTried to disconnect everything... replaced display & ssd without improvements.\nApple hardware test gave back a possible display problem only one time.\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks!"
