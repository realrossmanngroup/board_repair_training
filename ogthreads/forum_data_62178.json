The other way they both measure over 200K ohms.\nSo I guess they are OK?\n\nWIth both D3300 and D3400 removed, pin1 of the diodes show directly connected to ground (zero ohms), where as pin2 show 2.4ohms.\n\nAnd gee aren't they fragile, lol?\nI managed to shatter one with just the pressure of the tweezers.\n\nHaving a close look at j3000, one the USBC connectors, there appears to be some damage that is shorting it out through J3300.\nWhat do you think?\nThe first one is on the connector that is the highest, when looking at the top side in boardview, and on the top side.\nThe second one is on the connector that is the lowest, when looking at the top side in boardview, and is on the bottom side.\n\nIs it very hard to solder one of these J3300, new if available, or from a donor board?\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60357[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]60358[/ATTACH]"

I'll give it a shot.\n\nI've never really used solder paste to desolder anything....\nI've already removed the heat shield from the bottom side of the board. \n\nShould I be covering the 50+ pins under the heat shield on the bottom side of the board with 138 degrees solder paste?\nAnd heat from that side as well?\nIs that the correct way to approach it?\n\nI do not have any 58 degrees ChipQuik alloy.\n\nThanks again for your help."
