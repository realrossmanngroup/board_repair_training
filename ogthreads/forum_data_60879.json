ISL has been swapped. No change in Adapter Sense, SMC LID, FINSTACKSNS_ALERT_L, SMC_BC_ACOK or the SDA/SCL lines with cable connected or disconnected. I'm guessing theres a sensor reading being sent when the cable is connected that prevents the board from starting?\n\nGuessing I need to change the SMC, I tried reflowing it. But I'm confused as to why the board will start with cable unplugged."
