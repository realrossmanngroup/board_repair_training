            "message": "working on a1990 2018 strange issue, originally MacBook worked but one port was dead, it was a customer returned MacBook,  was able to identify which port was faulty and reflowed the cd32chips on that side of the board, didn't replace them just heated with flux, this restored the 20v needed on all ports, put MacBook back together checked voltages and once again i had 5v on the one port, all others had 20v. MacBook booted as it did before, removed logic board again  to get better readings, for some reason i am now getting 0v from all ports, no response from any charger, tried multiple amp meters and 96w chargers, any suggestions"
