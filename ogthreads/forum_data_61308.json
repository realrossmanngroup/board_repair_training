            "message": "Thank you to anyone taking the time to read this!\n\nWas a liquid damage six months ago, had a bath, a change of battery and was working fine. Since then, customer may have mentioned the battery started to perform poorly but in any case quickly and now does not run on battery alone.\n\nIt charges, coconut battery says health is good, and this a new battery again (as I took the problem at face value and just purchased a new battery - doing the test on the battery that was installed after the liquid cleaning gives all the same results) that is all to say I'm confident the battery is good.\n\nI found a couple of Rossmann videos both ended up on the G3H supply and the diode D7005 (on this board) that connects the charger and battery into U7090. However both the resistors going into D7005 and D7005 seem good - I get the right resistance on R7005 (and R7020) with the battery connected and no MagSafe I get 12.05V on pin 2 of D7005 and 11.81V on pin 3. U7090 has 3.42V on pin 4 \n\nI realise there is a little drop on D7005 but could that be the issue? I thought not as 11.81V seems in range and 3.42V out of U7090 look correct to my untrained eye.\n\nI'm not yet clear to attempt these repairs, really wanted to take some measurements to have a better idea of what was wrong. I'm sure the customer will be happy with us making such repairs but I'm not Louis level component repair experienced (obviously) and as the Mac otherwise works fine I'd really like to be confident I'm not going to make it worse before recommending a course of action to the customer!\n\nAny suggestions would be very much appreciated!"
