That works fine now with my test board.) Board takes about 15 seconds to post and is booting to the Critical Update screen. I have everything plugged in including the battery. Entire top case is tested and known good using good test board. I've also installed this board in an entirely different known-good case and it does the same thing. Any ideas what might be causing this?"

Might be worth a try?\n\nSome generic ?fixes? like nvram/pram reset won?t solve or help for this issue.\nFull clean install, installation on top of existing only fixes this half way.\nIf you want to avoid a reinstall - try this workaround:\nctrl+alt+shift+power to turn off the device Connect your macbook to the network WIRED with usbC->ethernet or usbC->thunderbolt,thunderbolt->erhernet, just like me\nTurn the device on. The boot takes longer but it boots!\nI did this 10 times to reproduce every time with the following results:\ndisconnected wired network, restart == critical update loop\npower down with key combination, connect wired network, power on == booting\nI have no persistent remedy for this issue.

The diode measurement on DFR_TOUCH_INT_L is fine at .484 on the bad board.\n\nIt's hard for me to understand where the 1.8V comes from on DFR_TOUCH_INT_L being that R4485 is no stuff and it's supposed to be an OUT line going IN to U3900. J4402 was one of the few things hit by the spill and I had to dismantle the Touch Bar circuitry on the actual Touch Bar cable and replace a resistor for that Touch Bar to work on a good board. The diode measurements on J4402 are all very close to the good board, but not exact. There may be a difference of up to .02. So maybe .450 vs .430. All very close.\n\nThe one difference I'm seeing besides DFR_TOUCH_INT_L is that pins 1, 5, 9 and 11 on J4401 on the good board will go from .570 to .740 every time I test them in diode mode. On that bad board those same pins always stay at .540. Other than that I can't find any differences."
