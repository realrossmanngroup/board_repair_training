            "message": "Hi, I have a problem with a 2012 Macbook A1286, I replaced the battery and installed an SSD for the customer then the customer started having random shut down issues. \n\nI have now replaced the battery 3 times, all aftermarket but from different reputable suppliers that I have used for years. Wiped the SSD & installed Mac OS fresh with a more up to date version, the max the Macbook will take - This did improve the shut downs so they happened less often but as time has gone on they have become more frequent. \n\nThe customer says the Macbook also gets very slow when its trying to wake up from this sleep state, though this happens both on and off charge and its not when the battery is low, the customer states the battery has charge. \n\nI've reinstalled the OS, replaced the battery multiple times, manually updated the SMC, reset the SMC & PRAM multiple times, it wakes from sleep perfectly fine. When I run \"log show --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"Previous shutdown cause\"' --last 24h\" it does show a code 0 on every shut down.\n\nMy main problem is that I cannot re-create the issue. It has never once done this for me, so this has made testing very difficult. I have tried it on my known working chargers and the customers but without being able to recreate the issue I can't prove thats an issue or not.  I have done some other repair attempts aswell but the customer takes weeks to tell me theres still an issue and drop it back in so I can't recall everything. \n\nIs this more likely to be an SMC or board fault? The only thing I can think to do now is send the customer away with one of my chargers and see if he has the issues again, tell the customer to finally replace the Macbook after 10 years of use or to put in the original battery, this would prove a battery issue but leave the customer with a faulty/dying battery as aftermarkets then wouldn't be an option.  \n\nThanks!"
