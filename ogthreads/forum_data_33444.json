            "message": "Moderate liquid damage on  board, above and under. R6920(47ohm resistor), Q5490(DCIN_S5_VSENSE) and ISL5269 were fried, replaced and got a green light. I thought these boards were supposed to be amber when no battery is present. Anyhow, if I attach a discharged battery then it turns amber and charges it. SMC reset also works. Any Ideas where to start? I can usually fix most boards but this model seems a lot more complicated or different than the others. \n\nAlso, I see that some of the caps around q7510 and q7550 area are corroded. Also, U5010.\n\nAdapter sense fluctuates between 3.2v and 3.33v\nDCIN 18v5 flucuates between 16.42v and 16.78v\nPP3v42 at 3.39v\nPPBUS_G3H very low at 1.1v\n\nI've replaced ISL twice just in case and same result. I'm thinking the issue lies around U5010?"
