I have saved your thread link in case I get a lead on the 00244.\n\nMay well be a Sunday job to probe every R C L on the 00244 board and note values ready for the next one you get. I mean hell it would be tedious but it may serve for future until (if) brd and schema are available. ........ Can't even find one to buy as reference board."

That huge pile looks more as though it would insulate rather than dissipate.\nI have some spongy thermal pads and a load of MX-4 paste but it's not even close to the thinkness of that stuff Apple are using. The way it's piled up it don't look to me like the metal is actually making contact with the die"
