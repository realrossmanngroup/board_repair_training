Board has no signs of water damage.\n\nEdit 1:\n\nManaged to get pp3v42 stabilized to 0.9v after replacing a cap right before u7100. Then replaced u7100 and the voltage raised to 1.2v.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI decided injecting 3.42v after the g3hot supply inductor, but the current draw is too low to be a short to ground (0.09a). Maybe the U7090 i put in was bad too."

Didn't know that it must be from same model board. I thought if it was the same chip it can be used, even saw Louis saying on a video that he used to buy chips with balls from ebay... Are you sure about that? I know SPI rom chips may have some problems with ME region, but SMC I really don't think so.\n\nSo to the measurements: SMC_ONOFF_L is 64mv and ADAPTER_SENSE is 3,35v. And also PPBUS is 12,33v. Remember Louis saying on a video that a bad SMC causes a drop on PPBUS voltage. Are we getting close here. As the failure was caused by a drop, will try reflowing the smc and get back with the results."
