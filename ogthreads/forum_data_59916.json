            "message": "Need help with one more board. 820-00165 with slight liquid damage around U8005 and U7701. Machine gives a chime and shuts off immediately. In fact it\u2019s just half a chime and it shuts off. After cleaning liquid damage, I get a fan spin but it shuts down after few minutes. PP5V_S4RS3 is at 5.11v when it starts and drops to 0v and machine stops. Any suggestions?"

Liquid damage and minor corrosion seen around U7701.
