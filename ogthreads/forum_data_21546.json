Had damage to U7100 area - shorted pins 23&24 17&18 - after some diagnosis removed Q7130 and shorts have gone away.\nProblem is i've only got 820-3536 donor boards and the Q7130 seems to have different pin placement. Does anyone know of any other boards that this chip exists on ?\nThanks!"

( i knew that the were ram differences between 3537 and 3476 but didn't know about the Q7130) - yes U7100 got changed too - pins 23&24 were burnt out and Q7130 had shorted to ground. Its now charging and ready for final testing. Please mark as solved."
