            "message": "Working on an 820-3115 board, and PPVCORE_S0_CPU is shorted to ground. I can tell the board has been worked on by Apple (black sticker, neat work, so I presume it was an Apple refurb) in the VCORE/U7400 area. Additionally, probe point 1329 is light-green from previous liquid. Board is clean otherwise. I've never dealt with a shorted VCORE before, but based on information from Louis' videos, it looks like the next step would be to replace Q7510, Q7520, Q7550 and U7400 all at once. I want to confirm that this is the proper next step before proceeding.\n\nCPU gets warm (as normal--not hot, so I don't think it's getting a straight 12.55v), and PCH gets appropriately warm as well. I have green light and a slight fan twitch, but no vcore voltage (all other S0 rails are present). \n\nClean board, no sign of damage or liquid. Thanks!"

CPU does not short for no reason so either that 1.3 is normal or something happened.\nAlso Apple exchange boards are GARBAGE. They all have had issues and were repaired too. If I see an Apple exchange board that failed it goes on the bottom of the pile and I mean 3 feet under ground.\n\nCompare Vcore and AXG to GND, they are usually very close."

U7400 itself even looks brand new (perfect edges, no chips, no stains from dirt/dust, perfectly bright pins, etc--perfect). \n\nAnd yeah I was using an i7 board to measure; checking an i5 board shows 1.7ohms, so you're right. \n\nHow would you recommend proceeding?
