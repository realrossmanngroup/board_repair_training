Noticeably it gets [I]very[/I] hot compared to a good board/laptop when left alone.\n\nNothing visible on the board, looks clean. All powers rails are present and ALL_SYS_PWRGD is good. SYS_DETECT_LED is also present. PPVCORE_S0_CPU is 0.795V which is about the same, if a tad higher than a known good board.\n\nI turned to looking at the SPI. When measuring with a multimeter (don't have an oscilloscope at the moment for this) on a known good board I see SPI_CLK oscillate for around 10 seconds after power input and see similar on SPI_MOSI however I don't see that on this board, it's static at 0V. Conscious I might be missing something in the 2-3 seconds after power input before the multimeter probes touch the board though.\n\nChecked for short on SPI_CLK using diode mode, measured 1.58V vs 1.62V on a known good board.\n\nUnsure where to look next."
