            "message": "Hello everyone,\n\nFirstly sorry for my english, french guy inside.\n\nI brought a macbook pro A1708 - 820-00840 logic board inside, wasn't powering on.\nHistory is a day, nothing happened when opening the laptop, that's all.\n\nNothing special inside, no corrosion, no liquid damage, never opened, pretty good state.\n\nFirst, with the logicboard alone on my desk, mesures are :\n5v017 and 0.000 amp.\nFinding a short on the PP3V3_G3H_VR, but not on the PP3V3_G3H (0.540 on diode mode)\nPPDCIN_G3H_CHGR_R present (5,1 volts) PPVIN_G3H_P3V3G3H around 4.1 volts. PM_EN_P3V3_G3H around 2 volts.\n\nTo isolate the CC, removed L6995. \nShort was not before it, but after, on PP3V3_G3H_VR. No short on PP3V3_G3H (at this time). \nRemoved all caps C6996/5/7/8/C6988/9, but short still there.\nDecided to remove R6999. Then no short on PP3V3_G3H_VR (happy) but now PP3V3_G3H is shorted ! (around 0.002 on diode mode)e\n\nResoldering L6995, plug-in USB-C charger => 5v017 on charger, 0.00 amp, but PP3V3_GH3_VR now present (3.42 Volts). \nResoldering R6999 (the real mistake?) but nothing else. No short on PP3V3_G3H_VR (Pin 1 of R6999 shows 3.42 volts) but sill present on pin 2. I suppose resistance can isolate a short, because nothing is connected to the ground.\n\nRemoving C7080 on PP3V3_G3H (the most easier before thinking at U7000) and... nothing more. I decided to leave the board beside.\n\nThis morning, i plug the charger to make new tests, and, without touching nothing since the last day, charge stays at 5v017 but amp drop from 0.3 to 1.8A ! Nasty smell around U3100 and U3200... touching in the zone and burning my finger on Cap C3100... Damned !\n\nCharger pulling down to 0.6 amp and 4.7 volts on first usb-c port, stay around this values and, around 5v017 and 0,3 amp on other port...\n\nSo i decide to take the voltage of PM_EN_P3V3_G3H => 5,17 volts !! how it's possible !\n\nI decided to remove C3100, C3200, and U7000. Unfortunatly there still a short on PP3V3_G3H, and now another on the PP3V3_G3H_UPC_XA and XB. \n\nSo i remove the R3000 and 3001, one by one.\n\nShort is gone on PP3V3_G3H_UPC_XA and XB, so i suppose U3000 & U3001 chips are fines.\n\nBut short on PP3V3_G3H is still there !\n\nI remove R6999 to be sure again, but no difference...\n\nAlso tested keyboard connector who looks perfect, nothing special.\n\nHowever, values are below :\n\nResistance from pin 15 to ground => around 2,6 ohms\nResistance from pin 16 to ground => around 0,9 ohms (same as shorting my multimeter)\nResistance from R6999 (pin 2) to ground => around 2,6 ohms\n\nSo Pins 15 & 16 aren't shorted together, connector seems fine.\n\nA idea for the nexts steps (without more destruction?)\n\nthanks a lot for your help"
