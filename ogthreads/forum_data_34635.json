            "message": "Hi-\nCustomer was using aftermarket charger.\nWas 3.42 on PPBUS. Bad magsafe i/o board, R7122, R7121 and ISL.\nReplaced all said components, and now have 12.56V and a booting machine.\nThe problem is when both battery and charger are plugged in, the light on the charger goes dead and computer no longer recognizes it after about 45 secs.. I have to reset the charger by unplugging for 30 seconds and plugging back in, then it will turn green again.\nReverse Current Protection?\nWithout battery I have no problems.\nWill run on charged battery by itself.\nHave tried with multiple batteries.\nMultiple magsafes.\nThanks, have a good one."

            "message": "[USER=\"1404\"]jamiehorn1[/USER] \nAt the time when I replaced R7121/22 I was getting 3 Ohms on R7151/52, so I figured everything was OK on the battery side. Shortly after my post,  R7121/22 went out again. This time R7151/52 went out as well. Replaced everything again including R7150, R7120 and transistors on Batt side and adapter side. Everything Is now working . Thanks for your input. Much appreciated."
