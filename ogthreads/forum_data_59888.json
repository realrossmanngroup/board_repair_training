I bought touchbars and now touchbar gives image but touch is not working. Checked J442 and seems to be ok. \n\nChecked J4402 for an kind of short to ground (with board off) and there is no short. Seems that touch is managed by U3900, is that right? What can i check?"

Once i solved it ( some small components it started normally.\n\n\n2INformaticos What i must check for J4401 to check why i am not getting image on touchbar?\n\n\n\nP.S. Just reinstalled completly clean version of 10.15 and same result. So i guess there must be something wrong with touchbar touch or image lines on logic board?"
