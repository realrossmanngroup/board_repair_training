I tried several displays and flex cables, and there is no backlight and no display. The internal does not show up in Settings>Displays, only the camera is recognized.\n\nPP5V_S0SW_LCD is 0V except briefly during the chime (5.1V).\nEDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is 0V except briefly during the chime (3.3V).\nDP_INT_HPD is 0V except briefly during the chime (3.3V).\n\nWhat would you check before blaming the EDP portion of the CPU?"
