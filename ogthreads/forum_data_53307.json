I am using one right now on my bench to type this. Each one was locked and I have removed that but now I need to add APFS support to them. When I sell them it will be a huge mess if they don't have APFS support.\n\nI am running El Captain 11.3 on my tech drive and that is the drive I am using now.\nIs there a bios update I can run on these?"
