            "message": "Have a 820-3115 that came in with severe water damage. Cleaned and replaced everything but having difficulty with the backlight fuse. Both pads were beyond bringing back so did scraping in the area to solder replacement fuse and running jumpers on each side of fuse\n\nMy problem is with my jumper for PPBUS_G3H point pin 1 of the fuse. When I run a jumper to R5400 which has PPBUS_G3H to the fuse it smokes and the jumper breaks. Have tried several different gage of wire with no luck.\n\nDo I need to run jumper somewhere else with PPBUS_G3H or is something else happening here?"

I would consider soldering the fuse directly to pin 4 of Q9706 and jumping the other pad of the fuse to something like R4260. That way you completely cut out the cluster fuck of what's left of the fuse pads and run your circuit away from the mess."
