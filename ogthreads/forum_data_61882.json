            "message": "This 2012 15'' 820-3330 was brain dead with all rails, not booting, no usb mouse activity.\n\nI read the bios with the medusa and had an \"Error read blockxxxx not found...\" (apologies didn't write exactly the error)... Tried a random testing 820-3330 bios and it worked and booted correctly.\n\nI want now to put back the customer serial but it seems the bios dumps on these machine looks like they are from another type, I mean that I don't find any $SVS or even the Serial C02 in hexedit...Should I look for another set of strings?\n\nMy plan is to replace manually the serial or even better the entire Fsys block and after that I will use Medusa to Clean ME and fix any CRC mismatch.\n\nHow would you do to replace the serial? \n\nThanks in advance"
