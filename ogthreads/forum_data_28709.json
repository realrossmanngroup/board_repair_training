            "message": "Hey Duke. This board at first was only half chiming when I got it. Nothing plugged in except speaker. Minor liquid damage around clock. First thing I did was reoaired a trace leading to Y2805 and replaced the clock chip itself. After that I got full a chime for 1 or 2 boots then it went dead. Now the fucking thing is missing S3's and everything else down the line. And of course with my luck PM_SLP is missing!!! I'm getting kind of tired of being defeated by this type of issue. LOL. :) Do you think that because reworking the clock area got me a full chime a couple times that this being dead now is most likely related to clock/bios as well? What do you think I should do? Besides sell my equipment on Ebay.\n\nThanks man. Have a good one."
