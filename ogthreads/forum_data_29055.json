Superclean board looks like new, not 1 corroded probe points at all.\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 8.57\nPP3V42_G3H = 3.42\nPP5V_S5 = 5v\nPP5V_S4RS3 = 0v (no pulse)\nPP3v3_S5 = 3.34\nPP3v3_S4 = 0.322v @ C4841\nbut at U1950 pin 1 = 0v, no short on these lines though\nPPVRTC_G3H = 3.34\nU6100 Pin 8 = 3.34v\n\nWhat could cause the low voltage at R8000 pin 1/2 from 0.322v? At C8000 I do have 3.4v so the IC gets power. All looks brandnew.\n\nPS checked also all SPI ROM resistors for correct OHM. Looks all clean too."
