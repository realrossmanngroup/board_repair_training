Unfortunately it hasn't made any changes and I also didn't take a complete list of the voltages I was getting before attempting the repair so I've only got the measurements after the repairs.\n\nThe CPU is getting warm and I've check all the traces and rails but don't see anything else wrong with the board. Hopefully someone can advise what I could check on next.\n\n[TABLE=\"border: 0, cellpadding: 0, cellspacing: 0\"]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"width: 220\"]PPBUS_G3H[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"width: 147\"]1.150V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPDCIN_G3H[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]16.92V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V42_G3H[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]3.39V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPVRTC_G3J[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]3.39V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S5[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S4[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S0[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_S0[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0.565V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_S3[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_S5[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]1.686V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[/TABLE]"
