Connected the mac in DFU mode and apply a revive option but shows the [U]75 error[/U] . Now the usb meter register 20v but in DFU mode have the same issue.\nIn some YouTube video saw that maybe the issue was the SSD so i check the rails and only PP2V7_NAND seems low (2.5V)\n\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC =3.3v\nPPBUS_G3H = 12.56v\n\n[U]U8600/U8607[/U]\nPP1V8_SSD = 1.8V\nPP2V7_NAND = 2.5V (Seems low)\nPP0V9_SSD = 0.9V\nSSD0_S4E0_VPP = 2.1V \nSSD0_S4E1_VPP = 2.1V\nSSD0_RESET_L = 1.8V\nSSD0_S4E0_PCI_AVDD_H = 1.8V"
