Board powers on and works but has fast spinning fans after about 30 seconds. Store reported it is Kernel panicking as well.\n\nCustomer replaced their screen themselves but destroyed the webcam connector, all pads pulled with it. As far as I now this shouldn't be the cause of the problem though.\n\nWhat to check next?"

Repaired traces and replaced both of those and sensor issue is no more! Going to fully test this over the weekend to make sure."
