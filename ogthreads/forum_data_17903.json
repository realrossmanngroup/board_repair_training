            "message": "I'm working on a late 2011 A1297 17\" MBP where one of the fans doesn't spin.  The fan will move very slightly back and forth but not spin.   The fan is actually good, it seems to be the power going to the fan from the connection on that side. The good side is kicking out 4.2v while the non-working side is only putting out 3.2v .  The rest of the laptop works fine.  I don't have the board view for this 820-2914-B board so I'm not sure where to look.\n\nCan anyone maybe point me in the right direction and / or if someone has this board view & schematic that would be really nice too."

So we plugged the original fan into the 2nd fan position and it fired right up like normal.  We then tried the other fan in the original position and it had the same non-working behavior.  Plus the voltage issue points right at it being something besides the fan."

I'm not the greatest with schematics so I'm sure you would have gotten to the same point in much less time.  In the end I simply  jumped J5660 Pin 1 to J5650 Pin 1.  Both fans are working perfectly now."
