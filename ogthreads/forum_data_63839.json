I noticed signs of coffee around the connector of the LCD display.\nAfter thorough cleaning, I noticed that coil L8504 is burnt.\nVoltage is stuck at 5V, current is going up to 53mA and then drops to 0A and stays like that on all USB-C ports.\nThere is no short circuit on the board.\n\nHere are some measurements I did:\n\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC_X - OK\nPP1V8_SLPS2R - OK\nPP20V_USBC_XA_VBUS - OK\nLOD on type C hubs - \u041e\u041a\nPP5V_G3S - OK\nPP3V3_G3H_T - OK\nPP0V82_SLPDDR - OK\nPP1V8_SLPS2R - OK\nPP1V1_SLPS2R - OK\nPP0V9_SLPDDR - OK\nPP3V3_G3H_SOCPMU - OK\nPPVCCPRIMCORE_PRIM_REG - \u041e\u041a\n\nI replaced all 4 USB-C hubs but no success.\nWhen I power on the Macbook, battery is charging.\nOther damage from the spillage isn't noticed.\n\nI'm in a dead end. \nThank you!"
