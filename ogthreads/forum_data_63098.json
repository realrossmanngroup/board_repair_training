            "message": "One of my guys did a battery replacement and after this Mac was getting random enter key presses. After troubleshooting I realized it does it without the KB or TP plugged in too. No signs of anything odd at TP or KB connectors. All pins of connectors are making contact to board. Diode testing nothing seems out of place. When testing J4813 for voltages I get 3V on every pin except: 1-3, 6-9, 13,14, 25-28 these are .1V and then of course 29 is ground. Any clue as to which of these is related to enter key? Control chips on back side look ok. Checked resistors around those IC's and nothing popping out at least as out of ordinary. KB connector is clean inside."
