WORKING.\n\nThought that I was the new Louis Rossman (Biggest mistake ever!) I decided to look under the board the water damage and clean it with alcool. They were corrosion around U4600 and U3310.\nAnd guess what ? Still have green light, fan spining for 2 seconds and stop, no boot !\n\nNeed some advice to know where to start ...\nSorry for being such a newbe.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00e9my"
