This board will only power on if a battery is connected. Here are the measurements from AC adapter. Green/Amber light present. 85 Watt Original. Thanks.\n\nPPBUS - 12.58V\nPP3v42 - 3.428V\nPPVRTC - 3.336V\nPPVIN_S5_HS_Computing - 12.58V\nPP18vDCIN - 16.6V\nPP5V_S5 - 5.02V\nPP5V_S3 - 0V\nPP3v3_s5 - 3.35V\npp3v3_3 - 0V\n\nHave a good one."

If I want to power on with only charger I have to use a chinese charger. Weird. Other then that it works totally normal. Have green/Amber on both chargers. Thank you sir."

With original charger I am getting pulses of 16.60 - 16.80V on the DC-in connector. With the Chinese one I get a steady 16.5V in the same test location. Powers on automatically when magsafe is plugged in with a battery attached.  What can I be missing?\n\nHave a good one."
