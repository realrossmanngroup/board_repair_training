            "message": "I know that installing MacOS \"SHOULD\" initiate a mid-setup prompt that a board is enrolled in DEP, and if it doesn't, it will \"usually\" pop up in MacOS post-install in the top-right corner of the screen. However, I've had some boards recently that show no notifications of DEP, and a few days after the customer receives the board, it will suddenly pop up. Obviously DEP is based on serial and internet is required, but is there some sort of terminal command or other method to \"force\" a DEP popup, if a board is in fact enrolled? I really get annoyed when we repair a board and find out it's DEP locked, and I hate it even more when it doesn't show a DEP notification during our post-repair tests, but then later DOES show a DEP message. It's just incredibly aggravating. Obviously getting firmware/DEP/iCloud locked boards is just a nature of the beast, but I want a more sure-fire way to determine if a board has one in place. It's a bad look to send a customer a board that works fine, but has DEP enrollment.\n\nDoes anyone have a sure-fire way to confirm whether or not a board has DEP enrollment active? I don't want to have to pull BIOS chips and read the $SVS every time or anything like that, I want a dedicated check we can perform during post-repair diags (in addition to clean install of MacOS). All help appreciated."

There should be a separate System Preference panel that's called 'Profiles' (this icon only appears when the Mac is enrolled in DEP, and otherwise is not visible).\nMake sure you have internet connectivity before opening systempreferences first."
