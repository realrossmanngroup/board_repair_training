(on a western digital easystore it blinks the light)\n\nCPU is getting very little warm,\n\nand also U3900 is getting a little warm, it is under-filled and looks very clean.\n\nU3100 -\nCPUVR_VCC - 13V\nCPUVR_IN - 5V\nALL_SYS_PWRGD - 3.22V\n[B]PM_PGOOD_CPUVCC - 0V[/B]\n[B]CPUVR_FCCM - 0V[/B]\nCPUVR_PWM1 - 2.52V\nCPUVR_PWM2 - 2.52V\nVR_HOT_L - 0.9V\n------\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 13.05V\nPPDCIN_G3H - 20.37V\nPP5V_S5 - 5.11V\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.41V\nPP1V_S3 - 1V\nPP3V1_RTC - 3.1V\nPP3V3_S5 - 3.32V\nPP1V8_S0 - 1.8V\nPP3V3_S0 - 3.3V\n\n[B]PPVCCCPU_S0G - 0V[/B]\n\nAny ideas? I am planning to replace the u3100 as I watched other videos from Rossmann and he replaced it, (even tho it is edgebonded all around) and it allowed the machine to work.\n\nPlease let me know what other measurements you would like me to give.\n\nPhotos attached."
