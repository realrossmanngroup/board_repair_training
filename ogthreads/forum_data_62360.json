When I opened it i saw that it was opened before and the lcd connector on the board was ripped off and backlight fuse was replaced.\nSo Replaced the lcd connector then i got an image but no backlight. \nAfter some measurements around U8401 I suddenly don't get an image anymore but the system is still booting I already checked the LCD connector bit it looks soldered good.\nPP5V_S0S2 is going up for a sec when plugging it in."
