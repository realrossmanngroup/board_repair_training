            "message": "Hello, first time poster here - not a repair shop owner - just decided to try and fix a macbook I acquired recently.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know the MacBooks history - just purchased it as defective for cheap with the only info given \"It suddenly didn't turn on anymore\".\n\nThe case seems eerily similar to [URL]https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/820-00840-s5-rails-not-steady.50493/[/URL] but the thread seems to have died without reaching a conclusion\n\nHere are some not-quite-highres pictures of the board: [IMG]https://linedot.org/images/Backcombined.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]https://linedot.org/images/Frontcombined.jpg[/IMG]\nSMC bypass did not work. Here are some measurements I performed so far:\n\nPPDCIN_G3H_CHGR = 20V\nTBA_AUX_DET = 4.97V\nTBA_VDDA = 5.20V\nTBA_VDDP = 5.20V\nPM_EN_P3V3_G3H = 5.20V\nPP3V3_G3H = 3.41V\nSMC_AUX_OK = 3.41V\nSMC_RST* = 3.41V\n\nD6905: \n  Pin 1: 13.04V\n  Pin 2: 19.92V\n  Pin 3: 19.66V\n\nF7000: 13V both\n\nP3V3S5_EN = jumps between 0V and 3V\nPP5V_S5 = jumps between 3V and 5V\nPP3V3_S5 = jumps between 0V and 3V\nPP3V3_S5G = 0V\nPP3V3_S5_S0R = jumps between 0V and 3V\nPP1V8_S5G = jumps between 0mV and 23mV\nPP1V_S5G = jumps between 0mV and 10mV\n\nPPVCCPCH_S5G = 0V\n\nPP3v3_S5_SMC_VDDA = 3.40 V\nPP1v2_S5_SMC_VDDC = 1.22 V\n\nPP5V_S4 = 0V\nPP3V3_S4 = 0V\n\nPP1V_S3 = 0V\nPP1V2_S3 = 0V\n\nPP5V_S0 = 0V\nPP3V3_S0 = 0V\n\nPP1V2_S0G = 0V\n\nP5VS4_EN = 0V \n\n\nU7890:\n\n1 (SSD_PWR_REQ): 1.51V\n2 (PMIC_EN_P3V3S5): jumps between 0V and 3V\n3 (GND)\n4 (PM_EN_PVXS5): jumps between 0V and 3V\n5 (NC)\n6 (PP3V3_G3H): 3.41V\n\nPP5V_S0 = no short\nPP1V8_S0 = no short\nPP3V3_S0 = no short\n\nPP1V_S3 = no short\nPP1V2_S3 = no short\nPP1V8_S3 = no short\n\nPP5V_S4 = no short\nPP3V3_S4 = no short\nPP3v3_S4_WLS = no short\n\nPP5V_S5 = no short\nPP3V3_S5 = no short\nPPVCCPCH_S5G = no short\n\nPP3V3_S5G = no short\n\nPP1V_S5G = short (Or just inductor (L8060,L1250,L1252,L1253,L1254) ?)\nPP1V8_S5G = short (Or just inductor (L7930) ?)\n\nPP3v3_S5_SMC_VDDA = no short\n\nPM_SLP_S5_L = 0V\nPM_SLP_S4_L = 0V\nPM_SLP_S3_L = 0V\n\nConsidering I am seeing a small voltage on PP1V_S5G and PP1V8_S5G with the charger connected, I assume that those aren't shorted? Otherwise I would proceed by lifting the inductors and checking if the short remains. Can you help me with how I should proceed?"
