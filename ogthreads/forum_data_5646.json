I have got a 820-3462 motherboard whit light water damage and when i connect the magsafe the fan start spinning for around 2 second and then shut down.[/SIZE]\n[SIZE=11px]whit out nothing connected the magsafe shows red light. sometimes after removing magsafe it use a couple of seconds and some times minute before it show red light .
