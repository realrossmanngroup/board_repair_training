So i soldered a nice connector on the flexcable and on the little mainboard.\n\nThe intresting is now for me that backlight is ok now but no apple or similar to see, obnly with a good display.\n\nthere was one pin, i am not shure if its soldered from the backlight flex cable connector. \n\ncan this connector cause a no picture fault?"
