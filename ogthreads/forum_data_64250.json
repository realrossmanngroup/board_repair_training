            "message": "Hi all.\nLooking at a 820-01958 board that was extensively water damaged.\nAfter cleaning, I'm only getting 5v on both USBC ports.\n\nWith the AC adaptor connected to the primary (REAR) USBC port: \nPP20V_USBC_T_VBUS 0.00v\nPP20V_USBC_X_VBUS 5.25v\nHowever,\nWith the AC adaptor connected to the secondary (FRONT) USBC port: \nPP20V_USBC_T_VBUS 5.25v\nPP20V_USBC_X_VBUS constantly fluctuating/cycling between 0.00v and about 0.50v\n\nI would normally assume that the fluctuating voltage would indicate a short on PP20V_USBC_X_VBUS, however as it shows 5.25v on the other port, it cannot be shorted.\nWould this indicate a problem with the Secondary USBC controller?\n\nI also just noticed that PPDCIN_G3H also fluctuates from about 2.98v to 5.05v ONLY when connected to the secondary USBC port.\n\nChecking coils, PP1V1_S3 also seems to be too low. \nIn diode mode, red to ground, it measures 008.\nIn resistance mode it measures 2.3\u03a9 to ground.\n\nAny suggestions appreciated, thank you."
