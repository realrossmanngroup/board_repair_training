            "message": "Hello,\n\nI managed to repair a liquid damaged 820-02020 board. There were two shorted capacitors.\n\nHowever, the laptop is stuck in boot looping. Everything is connected correctly (battery, trackpad...)\n\nI cannot even get to the boot option selection screen by holding the power button.\n\nI cannot get into DFU mode neither.\n\nI managed to get to the login screen once, but I can't get to it anymore.\n\nVideo here:\n[URL]https://streamable.com/2ayubc[/URL]\n\nHere is a video of the amp meter:\n[URL]https://streamable.com/k57gd5[/URL]\n\n[I]PPBUS_AON starts at 12.33v then drops to 12.04v a second after plugging it in\n\nI can also hear a clicking sound when it power cycles (right when shutting off)[/I]\n\nAny idea?\n\nThank you!"

Since then, even when disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it, I can't get to it anymore.\n\nI do want to mention, however, that the battery seems to hold a charge and can power on without a charger plugged in (but shows the same behaviour as originally explained)"
