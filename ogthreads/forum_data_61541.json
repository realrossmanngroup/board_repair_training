Performed SMC reflow and replaced 4 components around it.\n- MLB turned on after this but there was liquid damage in various other sections.\n- J9500 (IOB Micro-coax connector) cleaned up.\n- U3711 (SSD S0 switch was reflowed and one cap was replaced.\n- 2 components were replaced near the left speaker connector.\n- KBB connector was also cleaned.\n- Also replaced 3 caps behind the CPU.\n\n[B]After this[/B]\n- Turning on and booting from the internal drive. Very slow booting.\n- Not booting into Catalina from an external drive.\n- Booted into Sierra from an external drive. Still booting slow. Works fine once logged into OS. \n- Did full testing. \n- While changing the display/KBD brightness and volume levels. Slow animation.\n\nWhat should I do next?"
