I took out of the board and inspected it.. nothing.. as if the computer is barely used even.\n\nAnyway, customer said they tried erasing/formatting it and it got stuck on Apple logo preventing to go further.. I asked them why they tried to erase it from the first place? They said it turned off randomly once.. then they erased it and it worked out for a few days then it shut off again..\n\nI put the computer in DFU; I downloaded the latest Ventura IPSW and restored it.. during the \"Installing..\" it restarts then it shows the exclamation mark with Apple link to restore..\n\nI got numerous error codes among them: 4013, 4010, 21..\n\nedit #1: it never goes to boot selector.. when it says \"Loading Boot Options..\" it shuts off.."

Do I check the power rail voltages and check for shorts? Or is there a component level issue such as the battery being bad maybe?"
