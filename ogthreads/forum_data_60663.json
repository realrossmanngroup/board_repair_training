( PP3V1_RTC )\nR1401 3V is OK. ( PCH_INTRODER_L )\nR1408 3V3 OK\nR1407 3V3 OK\nR1405 3V3 OK\nL7690 3V3 OK\nR1403 3V3 OK\n\nQ7900: \nPIN 6;7 AND 8 1V\nPIN 5, 1V\nPIN 2, 13V\nPIN 4, 1V\nPMIC_EN_P3V3S5 OK\nPM_EN_P3V3S5G OK\n\nI checked R766 ( P5VS4_EN )\nIt was supposed to be 5 according to the schematics, but it's present only 3.3V. \nPM_EN_P1V8S3 3.3 present and it's weird \nThe charge also works one way. If I flip it won\u2019t charge or doesn\u2019t appear any signal \nCan you help me, please? Any suggestion."

If I flip it won\u2019t charge or doesn\u2019t appear any signal\"\nThat means a problem into USB-C areas.\nBoth ports have the same behavior?\nInspect for corrosion around CD3215 chips."

            "message": "Hi there, Thank you so much for the feedback. I inspected if any corrosion around that chip ( CD3215 CHIPS), and I didn't see any corrosion around it.\nBut I found a spot blocking the signal around the chip U7100 pin 41. The path was broken ( corroded ) as you can see in the pictures. \nI am just delighted because I just recovered that path and the MacBook is working perfectly. \nThank you so much for the tip! \n\nBDW, next time I will use rail name, not component. I didn't know that. I'm studying it yet. \n\nSo, for example, P5VS4_EN Shouln't measure with a multimeter, but oscilloscope right. \n\nYes, both ports had the same behavior. \n\nRegards \nManuel"
