            "message": "This 82-3115 seems to work normally but has intermitting issues. As i got it in it was booted up but everything on the screen that should be white was blue. After i disassembled it i cleaned a minor water damage and rebuild it. Now the color is normal again but it wont always allow OS Sierra to boot. But it is capable of Sierra (and high Sierra) for sure. Its the 2012 model...\nSometimes if i press ALT it just stays at a white screen (no picture at all), sometimes it works perfektly and sometimes it shows the boot menu but if i select any boot option it shows the \"circle with the line through it\". So it sees the drive but just wont boot because it thinks that its to old or something like this. If it wont boot it sometimes changes between the apple logo (just for a second) and the \"circle with the line through it\" and sometimes even the questionmark folder appears in between but its never going to boot. The customer said that the hard drive cable was changet a few month ago.\nThe water was only at LP8550 (but backlight works perfektly fine and i cleaned that) and a tiny bit on the SMC (shown in the picrure)\nNow i am not sure what to do. Should i give the SMC a reflow or could it be the Bios?"
