            "message": "820- 2849 A Have green Light but PPDCIN_G3H_INRUSH is 1.4V on pins 5,6,7,8 on Q7085. The funny thing is when I plug the charger and check voltage on the pins 5,6,7,8 of Q7085 the voltage is 12.6 v and its start to drop in 30sec to 1.4 V. And on Q7080 voltage is good on all pins. I've checked R7085 and R7086 and they are reading fine. Also checked R7020, R7021 and R7022 they are all good. Also replaced the U7000 but no luck. Any ideas what pulls the voltage down from Q7085? I've also replaced Q7085 but no luck"

I was removing and replacing the Q7080 and Q7085 after I replace them I've noticed that the voltage is ok but slowly goes down, and I start thinking why the voltage is goin down. And it click in my head because the board is cooling down from the heatgun and I started heating up the area again and voltage was going up so I started replacing the caps and I found out that the C7030 is bad. HOWEVER I still hear that clicking and pinching kinda frequency sound from some component and the board is still not powering"
