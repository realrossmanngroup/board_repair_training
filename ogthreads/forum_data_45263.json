            "message": "Have a 820-2936 that has no liquid damage but been messed with prior to arriving here. Flux on c1683 c1681 and c1680, they were also soldered backwards. CPU also has flux under it but does not look pop corned. When turns on it beeps 3 times and then turns off. Tried good known ram, one at a time each slot. CPU vcore starts at 1.1v, and remains at 1.1V until board powers off.\n\nSo far just replaced c1683 c1681 and c1680 and soldered them in correct position. What to check next or does this sound unfixable from prior idiot?"

When powered up now the fan spins and it beeps once every few seconds with or without ram and cpu core stays at a steady 1.1V. No longer powers off after a few seconds.\n\nIs there still hope for this board or better to put in donar pile??"
