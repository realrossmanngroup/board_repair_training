Tried SMC, PRAM resets, and removed coin battery, still no change.  no evidence of liquid damage or physical damage on the board.  PS visual looks good to.  Once booted to chime and LED 1 2 3 on w/ 4 dim (pic attached) the fan starts spinning higher then reboots.  this repeats.  Using a simple IR to scan for anything abnormal, shows cold board or nothing higher than 95F.  This is on the bottom of the board by the little IR flat cable.  \nIs it possible to be a PS issue even though 3 of LED lights on?  BIOS chip and boot ROM is damaged?  Logic board? Recommendations to test and narrow down?  Don't like using the \"swap-tronics\" method of troubleshooting plus don't have a spare PS or board available.   \nOriginal issue was customer kept filling up drive via emails dumping server and capacity errors so after removing files or running a clean up then reboot it never came back on.  New 3.5\" tried, new SSD (orig. 32GB SSD), new memory modules (these done by a different repair shop) but only resulted in $700 of charges for those \"test parts\".  \nI am a year free member and enjoy all things Rossmann!

Results.\nDid the SMC reset and the fan did spin up to high so it was successful correct?\nI connected only a apple wired keyboard and TB3 to HDMI TB3 to TB2 and tried booting into Safe Mode (did not) Diag Mode (did not), tried both video outs by going through the SMC reset and PRAM reset, to try and boot into safe mode or diag mode.  All I get is 3 LED 4th dim (if panel on it's ON) and the ext. screen lights up.  The keyboard does get detected since I can perform SMC but when trying to boot Safe or other the keyboard doesn't show on or Caps Lock light Num lock light doesn't show or work.  \nIs it possible the BIOS or EFI or Boot ROM chip is \"out of commission)?  \nJust seems like this pristine system that's in mint condition should work with no evidence of anything discolored, broken, etc.  \nShould I try using compressed air to see if a component gets hotter than rest at boot up?  I've tried IR gun but the entire board (bottom or facing out when installed) is room temp except around the Coin battery Pads.  Just below is a 470 cap and this gets to 98-102 F while everywhere else is room temp. Also, after boot up or normal boot attempt, once the 3.5 or 4 LED's on and ext. screen lights up that after 60 seconds it reboots.  This will continue at least 5 times then I powered down.  But like clock work it reboots at 60 seconds.\nAll info all help all ideas -- I am very thankful!!!!"

There's not much on GPU resolutions for this model yet.  \nSo if GPU then is it possible to have some protection cap or fuse to blow to save the GPU?

New info:  Cable replaced for rule out.  If BIOS then what are symptoms of a problem BIOS chip?  I also have now all 5 LED's on and bright.  The screen shows backlight or brightness but no video.  Once it chimes, all 5 LED's are on it will reboot and it repeats this every 59 seconds.  (i stop watched it over 10 times with almost on the 59 second mark).  I do get a white vertical line in the middle.  This screen is one from another system that was in excellent condition but had a broken panel.  Broken panel would work enough to boot, install an OS, or anything actually.  So i know the screen works.  What would cause an iMac 2017 to chime, turn all 5 LED's on, show screen brightness and a vertical but reboot every 59 seconds?  No hands have compromised any component on the board.  I did notice on the LVDS connector to be bent.  Which was I'm guessing the original shop during panel removal and lost control while still connected and it bent.  I tried seeing if anything under a scope looks bad but not enough exp. to say one way or another.\nAttached pics are of LED's all lit and a zoom in on LVDS connector on the board.  \nIf any ideas come to mind or anything I'm all ears (eyes).  \nNote: did the do SMC bypass and it to has all 5 LEDS's on, screen brightness like described but it doesn't reboot after 59 seconds!!\nLVDS connector pic below shows the corner that was bent over.\nMany thanks"

Brain poof!!\nI have a generic USB tester and ran the following tests.\nPlugged into USB C TB3 port and voltage showed 5v and it came up on the tester screen just after pressing power and stayed on past the chime and didn't go out or drop off until the 59 second mark and it reboots.\nPlugged into USB ports and same results as the TB3 port(s). I tested both TB3 ports and all 4 USB ports and results were the same for all 6 tests.  I attached a pic of the tester plugged in both the TB3 and USB ports.  Pic's taken after chime and I clocked it so that I take the pic around 55 seconds after power up.  This process is very repeatable and all ports.  \nSo does this mean it's possible the BIOS chip was disrupted/interrupted or messed up when screen pulled with power and LCD cable attached?\nI have 2 preprogrammed BIOS chips I got from an eBay seller that programs per order I guess for this exact model.  I have not tried replacing the chip as you mentioned earlier in this thread as try it because my smd solder skills aren't 100% trusted yet.  \nLooking forward to anymore advice or ideas.
