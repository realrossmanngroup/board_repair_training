            "message": "Have a 820-2915 that has the 216-0809000 GPU. Had typical GPU graphic problem. Replaced with NEW GPU from SEE-IC so no fake but had lines on a section of the screen and noticed piece of glue was stuck under the vram U8550. Tech accidentally pulled pad 152 and 153. These both seem important.\n\nWondering if it would be possible to move U8550 over to U8450 OR U8400 since there are no vrams soldered there on this board with the 216-0809000 GPU for a fix or is this board trashed now?"
