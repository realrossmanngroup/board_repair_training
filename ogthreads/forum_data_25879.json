            "message": "Hello, I have a water damage 820-3115 that doesn't turn on. Most of the corrosion occurred on J6955 (BIL) and U3280 (t29 15v boost regulator). When I was checking the power rails I noticed that the S3 rails are missing. I also noticed that this line beeps to ground when I connect the magsafe. Is this normal? I'm assuming there is something wrong with this line rail is preventing this macbook from turning on. Can someone give me some input; not sure what else to do.\n\nMy voltages are the following:\nPPBUS_G3H 12.52\nPPDCIN_G3H 16.88\nPP3V42_G3H 3.46\nPP5V_S5 4.95\nPP3V3_S5 3.29\nPP5V_S3 0\nPP3V3_S3 0\n\nThanks,"
