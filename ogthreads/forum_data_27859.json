When adapter is used without battery the fans spin up for a few seconds then shuts down and restarts (All S3 rails cycle.) Also, will not stay powered on with HDD plugged in.

The hard drive thing seems like it could be a separate issue but maybe also related. IDK.  Where should I start to try to narrow it down? I have checked U7201. PM_SLP_s4_l drops when the fans do on AC power. All s3 rails drop. I have S5 rails steady. I just need a little direction. Thanks man."
