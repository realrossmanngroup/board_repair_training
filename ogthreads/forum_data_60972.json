            "message": "Hello,\n\nI have a 820-3023 MacBook Air with a keyboard / track pad issue. I found corrosion on the trackpad connector which I replaced and trackpad started working as well as most of the keyboard keys. I replaced the whole keyboard and now both the trackpad and keyboard works. After a day of testing, both keyboard and trackpad suddenly stopped working. I checked voltages and was getting weird USB _TPAD_CONN_P / USB_TPAD_CONN_N voltages (2.8 volts / 1.9 volts). I replaced U5700 and now I get 3.3 volts / 0 volts and trackpad / keyboard works again. However after 1 day of testing again, it stopped out of no where USB _TPAD_CONN_P / USB_TPAD_CONN_N abnormal voltages again. After a bunch of measuring, seems the only thing left is the U2650 which I replaced. Worked for a little bit, and again back to weird issue. I replaced trackpad to make sure that might not be it and UC'd the board. Same issue. I even tried with the keyboard disconnected and just the track pad, but seems to have nothing to do with the newly installed keyboard.\n\nAny thoughts?"
