            "message": "Hey Guys,\n\n\nThis air had a sticky Liquid spill towards the top of the board around the SPI Chip customer said they had another store look at it already. Had Corroded Test Point that broke the trace on SPI_CS0_L. Repaired that and cleaned up any other signs of corrosion. R6116 was missing. Replaced that. There was some corrosion under U6100, U6101 and U1900. I can't see any other signs of damage. SMC Reset L is normal at 3.4V. Light on charger goes green to orange when shorting smc reset to ground. so I assume SMC is functioning normally. No signs liquid hit it either. \n\nAs expected, Missing PM SLP S4 L, I've only had a couple of these rabbit holes and have called it quits on all of them. Im determined this time... No Scope so can't check if the 3.3V has any frequency to it. \n\nSPI Chip Voltages:\n\n1 - 3.3\n2 - 0\n3 - 3.3\n4 - 0\n5 - 3.3\n6 - 3.3\n7 - 3.3\n8 - 3.3\n\n\nPower Rails:\n\nAll G3Hot Rails are all present and at normal values.\n\n5v s5 - 5v\n\n5v s4rs3 - 0v\n\n5v s0 - 0v\n\n\n3v3 s5 - 3.3V\n\n3v3 s4 - 0V\n\n3v3 sus - 3.3V\n\n3v3 s3 - 0v\n\n3v3 s0 - 0v\n\n3v3 s4sw sns - 0v\n\n1v8 s3 - 0v\n\n1v2 s3 - 0v\n\n1v05 sus- 1v\n\n1v5 s0- 0V\n\n1v05 s0 - 0v\n\n1v05 s0sw pch hsio - 0v\n\n0v6 s0 ddrvtt - 0v\n\n15v tbt - 0v\n\n3v3 tbt - 0v"
