I was using my bench power supply with a modified cord for power.\n\nWhen I use a regular charger it is dead.  Nothing comes on.  No green light, No fan spin.  I know my bench power supply sends power regardless of one wire but I get the green light with this supply and the machine turns on so I know the charger is talking to the SMC.\n\nI replaced the SMC no help\nI replaced the DC-IN and ribbon no help.\n\nWhen I use a stock charger no \"one wire activity\" and the charger never turns on the machine.\nLooking at the \"One Wire\" signal line I never see data with the scope."
