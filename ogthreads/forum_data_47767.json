            "message": "Hi,\n\nI've got that 2017 MacBook Air board which had a tiny liquid damage near U7600.\nIt would not turn on.\n\nAfter replacing the chip, it woudn't turn on either.\nBoard would pulse twice and then nothing.\n\nI've then decide to replace U1930 since it was near U7600 and got the board turning on but stuck at 0.4Amp which is not normal as this board usually draws 0.6Amp.\nIt seems it would even reset like the 820-3437 would do (RTC reset) but just once.\nPlugging a screen would bring no picture (no voltage on the coil). On external screen, same thing.\nA USB will light up.\nPPVCore_S0_CPU is 1.8V.\nResistance to ground on CPU is 16ohms which seems fair enough.\n\nI did replace the Bios with a similar 820-00165 model (same specs) but same thing. I did put back the original Bios chip for now.\n\nAny help on which signal I should check?\nDoes it sound like a faulty connection between Bios and CPU?"
