            "message": "Ok so i have a a2337 board i use for testing panels before i install them. Unfortunately yesterday it stopped working. It just take 5v 0.48a and if i put it in a housing it will sometimes go to 19v but only take 0.02 amps. I believe the device is in dfu mode due to the multiple on offs. I haven't checked for anything yet just assuming its in dfu mode. So the question is. What does the board need to enter dfu mode successfully? Does it need a battery keyboard etc ?\nAlso this board is always out the housing with just the type c connector and lcd cable taped to cardboard. After i see it boot to the login screen i would check the panel and then yank the power from it. I would prefer to save it for my convenience so any help is appreciated."
