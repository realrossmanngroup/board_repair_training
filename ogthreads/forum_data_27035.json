Now, I notice I keep losing pp3v3_s3. I have replaced Q7810 and regained pp3v3_s3 for about 60 seconds, fans were spinning but still no CPU_VCORE. Then soon lost pp3v3_s3 again. Im assuming if I replace Q7810 it will come back. But I am assuming I will most likely lose it again. R7975 was ripped off, and has been replaced. If I'm way off please let me know. Thanks, have a good one bro, appreciate it."

Maybe Im confused. Please help me understand. GPU edge bonding is still original. No burn marks in the area. RAM sticker in tact. Resistor was ripped off as if someone had removed the board carelessly and maybe slipped with a screw driver putting it back in. Thank you Duke."

            "message": "Hi. Yes. I had 3v on pin 3 and PP3V3S3_EN was not present. When I remove Q7810 for a like 10 seconds and put it back on, pin 3 becomes 0 and PP3V3S3_EN is present giving me PP3V3_S3 & S0. This does not stay. After I unplug the power and plug it back in I'm back to 3v on pin 3 and PP3V3S3_EN not present. Now, even with my 3v rails being present , I still did not get CPUVCORE. Checked Q7950 and found I was only getting .361V on VMON_Q4_BASE. Though I was getting 3.3V on pin 6, 1.074V on pin 5, 1.497V on pin 7 of Q7950. All this doesnt matter because once i unplug I lose my 3V S3 rail. What changes when I remove this chip? Thanks Duke.\n\n\nUpdate -\n\nQ7812 (non working state)\n\npin1 - 0\npin2 - 0\npin3 - 3.3V\npin4 - 0\npin5 - 0\npin6 - 3.2- 3.0V. It fluctuates up and down. Mostly down.\n\npm_slp_s3_l and pm_slp_s4_l are missing in this state.\n\nThanks"

This only lasted for about ten seconds, then board shut off and PP3V3S3_EN and was gone. I disconnected power and plugged back in, and the same thing occured but this time only for a couple seconds. Thanks alot. Have a good day.\n\nPM_slp_S4_l is also gone, which is where schematic says PP3V3S3_EN comes from."
