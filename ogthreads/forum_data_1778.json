            "message": "Hi\n\nBoard was liquide damaged. After cleaning by ultrasonic cleaner it was worked but  one day later it stopped. When i checked voltage cant see  PP5V_S3.\nWhen i checked u7200 its too hot and replaced it 2 times but nothing changed its also hot. After that i was removed L7260,Q7260,Q6201,Q7220,L7220, and all resistors and capacitors around U7200 but same status:(  PPVIN_S5_5VS3 is 12.8 not problem. Do you have any suggestion ?\n\nnote: I checked PP5V_S3_REG and PP3V3_S5_REG not short a ground."
