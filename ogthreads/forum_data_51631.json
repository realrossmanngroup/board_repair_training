In case its pulling it down. Still doesnt work. very strange! Could it be somehthigng inside ethe board thats messing it up?\n\nnever seen before a Resistor having volateg on one pin and nothing on the other even with a new resistor."

It seems so\n\nI will try to remove the IC U6990 again and see if the short is gone and revert back to you asap."
