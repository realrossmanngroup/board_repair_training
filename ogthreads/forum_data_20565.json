            "message": "i received this machine today for a screen replacement now it won't power on. this was a normal complete top lid replacement that had no complications everything went smooth(and yes the batter got unplugged before service), but when i went to power it on to test the screen i got no power. at first i had no green/orange light on the charger switched to different charger and got green/orange light. This is where it gets strange... the machine would only get a light on the charger if i unplugged the charger from another machine. long story short... i found i had an issue with the isl6259 sorting pp3v42_g3h to only having 2.0v out.\nso change isl6259 get all voltages back on track. but still no power on. i tested around to find i have no pm_slp_s4_L so i went a little further to find i didn't have pm_och_pwrok then no ALL_SYS_PWRGD.\n\nfrom what I'm seeing ALL_SYS_PWRGD comes from u8160? but this chip is not on the board( never was there) I'm kinda way beyond not sure where i should go from here.\n\nany ideas would be awesome"
