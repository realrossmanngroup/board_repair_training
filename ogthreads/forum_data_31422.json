            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have that board was not turning on at first + no green light.\nReplaced DC-IN board as some diode mode very different from a known working one.\nStill no go.\nI saw a difference in diode mode on F7005 between each side of it. Replaced F7005. Got a quick green light on the charger then off, then green light again and off, etc...\n\nDecided to use my DC power supply to power the board.\nIt tries to turn on, I am getting all the rails (it seems) for a second and then the amperage goes to 0.1 and back 1.5Amp. You can see the fans spinning and slowing down when the amperage goes down then back to normal speed.\nIt does that in loop like a quarter fan spin.\n\nI've checked different the S0 rails and they all show a proper value.\n\nI can't seem to find what's wrong with it.\n\nHistory is : Mac was used with a knock-off charger.\nBoard looks fine under the microscope, no sign of corrosion or burnt components.\n\nI am thinking, I should rework the ISL6259 area. What do you think?"
