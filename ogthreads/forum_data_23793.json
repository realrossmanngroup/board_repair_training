            "message": "I've got this one that isn't detecting wifi most of the time. Eventually on some boot-ups it is working. Something like 1 of 50 times it is discovering the wlan card and working. But after reboot and for the next many many reboots says \"no wifi hardware installed\"\n\nNo liquid and no corrosion to be seen anywhere. I have tried:\n\n- checked for software issue, it's not as it does the same in both known good os and is also not detected in the boot manager\n- known good wlan card\n- known good rio board\n- known good rio flex cable\n- power 3 and 5 V are going to rio power connector\n- J9501 looks beautiful \n- L9501 looks and measures ok\n\nWhat's the next thing to check?\n\nThanks"
