            "message": "Hi guys I have an 820-00165 that was liquid damaged, replaced U5480 as there was the spil and ultrasoniced it board looks very clean overall. The Mac turns on and has all voltages, I can see the display turning on but no drive is recognized. External drive also does not work. Voltages I get on U5480 are 3.3v on pin 3,4 and 5 and only 0.216v on pin 6. Replaced another U5480 but same issue. Also tried to boot from external SSD didnt work either. Ideas?"
