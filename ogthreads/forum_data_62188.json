            "message": "thank you! I did it. and now I have a method for soldering other difficult connectors like 27\" retina iMac eDP. I prep the previous solder with 183C paste, clean/dry, preheat around 175 (or whatever is high enough to allow hot air to liquify the solder without melting plastic, and low enough to allow the component to harden quickly after you stop the hot air), add flux, add hot air while pressing down on the connector. Thanks again for the ideas"
