            "message": "I have mac mini 820-2993 there are no schematics available, the board is in short. Power supply works. I inspected board carefully and didnt find any bad capacitor or other deformation. Board is not water damaged.\nWell at this point I tried simply supply power to the board directly in hopes something get warm.\nCPU got warm, then I started picking coils to find out if it is something in between or the CPU, slowly and surely I got all the way to COIL next to CPU. Removing that coil removes short from the board except on CPU side ( I assume cpu side). So I gave it 1v to make sure, and cpu get warm. Did I actually discover short or it is simply low resistance power rail?\nMy question is did I ruin CPU when connected power to the board and warm up CPU?\nI am not sure what alse can I do in this case,could any one suggest troubleshooting ideas that would help?\n\n[ATTACH]7804._xfImport[/ATTACH]"

If you put more than 3V on the bus of the CPU it is probably dead already.[/QUOTE]\nYes main bus was short to ground. Connector that get power from power supply was short to the ground. Since I didnt find any broken capacitors I supply 12v to the connector were power supply goes... Did I do it wrong? I am trying to apply my cellphone repair experince to the macbook repairs. How should I have started if main bus is in short?"
