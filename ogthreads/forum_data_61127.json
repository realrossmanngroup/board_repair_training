            "message": "Hello Team,\n\nI have an issue with a macbook air A1466 (MB: 820-00165-A).\n\nWhen I \"plug\" the magsafe, I have a green light for a second (maybe less) and then nothing more after it, the battery doesn't charge.\nStrangely, it's working absolutely well when I use it only on battery.\n\nHere are the tests / changes I made:\n- Used a different magsafe (known working)\n- I changed the I/O board with a new one\n- I changed the I/O board cable with a new one\n- During one second (after \"pluging\" the magsafe) I have +/- 3.4v on PPBUG G3H and 0V after it (measured at L7095)\n\nBut nothing solved the issue.\n\nI'm not sure where to start tshoot.\nCan you help me with this please ?"

Did you test with 45/60W original Magsafe 2 charger?[/U][/I]\nYes, with both of them and the result is exactly the same (green light for one second and nothing after it)\n\n[I][U]2. If yes, see what happens with fake charger, or lab PSU. [/U][/I]\nI've just check with a fake 60W magsafe 2 charger (I never use it) and the green light appeared then the orange light with the battery charging.\n\n[I][U]3. Post exact ohm value for R7012 (measured onboard).[/U] [/I]\nThe exact value of R7012 is 68,2 kOhm\n\n[I][U]4. Check if D7012 is good[/U][/I]\nThe D7012 (Diode Zener) seems to be good (0,807 V on normal flow and infinite on the opposite flow)\n\n[I][U]5. P[I][U]ost U7010 voltages[/U][/I][/U][/I]\nI'm sorry, but I don't find the component U7010 on schematics, where can I find it ?\n\nI remain at your entire disposal.\nThanking you in advance"
