Aftert clean this area, I already have 12.56V but now doesnot power.\n3V_S5 are present\n5V_S3 appears only when plug the charger the first time for 0.1 seg. It doesnot pulsing.\n\nIf I remove R1872 to separe PCH from clock it start pulsing each 8 seg all rails except CPU rail.\nI replaced clock chip 3 times and all the same:\n\n32khz are present\nSYSCLK_CLK25M_SB - NOT present\nI took working clock chip from another working board and same. Dont have 25Mhz. \n\nI do have =PP3V3_S5_SYSCLK and =PPVBAT_G3_SYSCLK\nBut something is wrong and clock doesnot generate 25Mhz. At this point I dont know what more to check."
