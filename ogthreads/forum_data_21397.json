            "message": "820-3115 stuck in 1 second fan spin loop.  Multiple places with corrosion, cleaned well with ultrasonic. \n\nReplaced u5400 and ran wires reconnecting it to R5400.\nAnother bad trace between Q5490 and r5494 fixed\n\npm_slp_s3_l is toggling on and off and I traced it to multiple places on the board looking for it's souce.  It's produced by U1800 per the schematic but then I see that is has something to do with GPIO29 which is related to SLP_LAN.  Is the LAN somehow putting this machine into sleep mode.\n\nmuch appreciated,\nPaul"
