On investigating I find that PCIE_RESET_L is also low.\n\nApparently the missing signals is what's causing Q9806 not to turn on although the booster circuit seems to be working fine because shorting 4 & 5 on Q9806 brings back backlight.\n\nWill appreciate any help on the missing signals.\nRegards."
