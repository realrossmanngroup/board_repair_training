No image, no chime.\nI've put back the bios info (bin file) wich i've previously saved, again with no issues but the board refuse to give me an image or a chime.\nEverything appears to be normal, all the rails are present,the components gets normally hot.\nI did this flashing without removing the bios chip from the board.\nCould this causes some damage to the board?\nThe good board from where i only did the reading still works fine.\n\nAny suggestions?\nI would much appreciate!"
