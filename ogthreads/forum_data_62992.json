[I]UPC0_5V_EN?\n\nPPVBUS_USBC0 is only 1.7V (UPC0_5V_EN = 0V) when an usb device is connected, PPVBUS_USBC1 is 5.1V (UPC1_5V_EN = 3.2V) with an usb device connected ... which is normal.\n\nSo I assume the CD3217 (UF400) is faulty because the _EN signal is an output line, which is generated by the CD3217, right?[/I]\n\nNote: That was the water damage.\n[MEDIA=imgur]a/YUOjvLo[/MEDIA]\n\nIssue solved ... a CD3217 reflow solved the issue, im now getting 3.2V on the UPC0_5V_EN signal) :) and im able to power an usb device."
