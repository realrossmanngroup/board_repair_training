The board brings the question mark folder.\n\nThe hall-sensor on the right side was gone - i put a donor part on it.\nR8604 looked like somebody did some work on it. so i recognized that it is an 10k resistor. in the schematic is an 100k resistor shown. so i changed it to 100k. \n\nHere are my measurements. Can you help me to understand which signal is ok? I have not much experience with ssd circuits and i don't understand the low-signals.

Thanks for the explanation of the l-signals, that helps me a lot for better understanding.\n\nThe customer gave me this information ...\n\"When using Final Cut Pro, we always had the case that the system was very slow, leading to a crash (complete freezing). This effect occurred particularly in the somewhat larger projects, so it was probably load-dependent. Working with other programs was largely problem-free.\nIn the last few days before the total failure, the effect increased so much that it was hardly possible to work with Final Cut Pro.\"\n\nAnd here are actual measurements (SSD-Side):\nJ9600 Pin 6: SSD_PWR_EN_LB_L = 0V\nJ9600 Pin 8: STORAGE_LB_EN = 3,33V\nJ9600 Pin 4: SSD_BOOT_LB_L = 1,78V\nJ9600 Pin 2: PP5V_S4_P2V7NAND_LB = 5,14V\nJ9600 Pin 44: PPVIN_2V7NAND_LB = 13,06V\nJ9600 Pin 38/40/42/46: PP3V3_S5_SSD_LB = 3,36V\n\nI have now also changed U9300 (JIC) - has brought no change"
