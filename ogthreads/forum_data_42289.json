            "message": "Morning guys.\nLogic board 820-3435-B. no image. screen illuminates. no chime ( may be turned off). Logic board is immaculate.... to immaculate TBH.\nTested so far:-\nPins 18/19 J8300 PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_UF =0.00v\nL8304 Pins 1/2 =0.00v\nR5670 not fitted\nU8300 pin 1 EDP_PANEL_PWR= 0.00v\n           pin 2/3 PP3V3_S5 =3.334v\n           pin 4/5 PP3V3_S0SW_LCD_R =0.001v\n           pin 6 GND =OK\nJ8300 pin 14 DP_INT_HPD_CONN =0.00v\n           pin 24 DP_INT_ML_P<0> =0.001v\n           pin 24 DP_INT_ML_N<0> =0.00v\n\nSeeing as the screen is illuminating I have not tested pins 3/4 on J8300\n\nNow, I am assuming that EDP_PANEL_PWR needs to be present to activate U8300 but reading the shematic ( probably incorrectly) this leads back to pin 765 on the CPU. using Landrex I do not see anywhere that I can test for EDP_PANEL_PWR. Also.... might be me and it being an early morning, I have done a search on the forum for 820-3435 no image even down to a straight 820-3435 search and apart for a post that has Duke on it where it is surmized that the CPU is dead, I have found nothing with reference to this issue on this board.\n\nHas anyone got any pointers or is it in fact a \"gonna\"?\n\nMany thanks in advance."

            "message": "Hi [USER=\"682\"]2informaticos[/USER] . OK above testing was done without the screen attached. I did do a PRAM and SMC reset prior to doing the probing, but did the PRAM one again. I also reconnected the screen.\nUpdated info:-\nStill no chine.\nConnected a HDD that I have got multiple OSx on and the LED flashes. I also plugged in a keyboard and used to do the PRAM and SMC reset. As to the PRAM the logic board restarted and the SMC the LED on the adapter changed from orange to green and back to orange so I can clarify the USB side of things are working.\nPins 18/19 of J8300 with screen connected goes to 3.331v and stays at that voltage.\nPin 14 goes to 2.63v and stays.\n\nI have an MBA here that is a A1370. Is the screen usable with that of the A1465? Just for diagnosis puroses.\nThanks."
