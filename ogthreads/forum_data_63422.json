I had the board labeled as backlight, no image, so I believe it may have turned on at some point. But I don't believe I had another board available to confirm if it was indeed the board or if it was a faulty screen. Q8400 looks to be missing a leg for pin 3 but I don't believe this would prevent the board from turning on so I was tackling this issue after the ladder."
