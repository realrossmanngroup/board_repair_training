            "message": "Very complicated Mac.\n\nIt arrived without recognizing MagSafe and cooler fired. I only discovered the oxidized U5800. I cleaned everything and replaced it, the Mac worked perfectly for 2 days and stopped recognizing the MagSafe (no LED and the system does not recognize the connected MagSafe). I took it apart to test, it worked again. A day passed, it stopped recognizing Magsafe, when I disconnect the battery, it recognizes MagSafe again.\n\nNote: When it was working, recognizing MagSafe, whenever I connected MagSafe, the Mac would turn on.\n\nI changed the DC board and cable, the battery and it didn't solve the problem. Using original MagSafe.\n\nI'm waiting for it to stop working again to check voltages.\n\nWith it working:\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.4v\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.6v\nISL6259 pins 17.18 - 4ohms, 27.28 - 20ohms\n\nMaybe the bad ISL6259?"
