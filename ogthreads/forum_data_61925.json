The board is a 820-2262.\nI have no solid MagSafe light: it blinks regularly but very faintly, sometimes green, sometimes orange. You can hear a very light clicking from the board when the light blinks.\nI measured all the basic power rails, including PP18V5_DCIN, and they all fluctuate between 0 and the target voltage. Even the OneWire circuit fluctuates.\nThe charger is an original 85W Apple charger, but I tried a load of different bricks and there's no difference.\nNo liquid damage, no previous repairs.\nI need some advice... thank you!"
