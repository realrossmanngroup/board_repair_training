Stayed on the shelf for a while, until I started to watch Youtube repair videos. I thought it must have been the TI USBC mux, so I got a USBC power meter, but that showed 5V -> 20V transition, and 0A current draw.\n\nFurther diagnostics showed a good PP3V3_G3H and PPDCIN_G3H_CHGR, but everything else was missing (PP1V8_S3, PP1V2_S3, PP3V3_S3, PPBUS_G3H- well, no battery connected.) SMC was suspect, but SMC_RESET_L is present (3.4V).\n\nI doubt that all the rails are short to ground, so is the SMC suspect? How does one tell if the SMC is active and doing its job/jobs?\n\nAny next step debug suggestions much appreciated.\n\nNo water damage, clean board."

The CPU branch had a 3.3mV drop over 3mOhm, so that's 1A at 1.5V injection into PPBUS_3GH.  I tried to find a hot spot all over the board, but nothing.  The only thing heating up is the CPU, and not all 3 dies (shinning pieces of silicon), just the center (larger) CPU die.\n\nCan I assume this is a CPU replacement?"
