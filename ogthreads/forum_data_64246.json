            "message": "Hi,\n\nI have an A1466 820-00165-A that has no power, and only consumes 0.020A on bench alone and on PSU.\n\nIt had PP3V3_SUS shorted, and after replacing C7840 (oxidated) the short is gone. However I only has 2.550V on PP3V3_SUS.\n\nOn U8020 I get 3.2V on P3V3SUS_EN and 3.3V on PP3V3_SUS_FET_R.\n\nPP1V05_SUS has 1.057V\n\nPP5V_S5 = 5V\n\nPP3V3_S5 = 3.3V\n\nPP3V3_S4 = 0V\n\nPP5V_S4RS3 = 0V\n\nPP5V_S0 = 0V\n\nThe mac doesn't show any liquid contact.\n\nCan you help?"
