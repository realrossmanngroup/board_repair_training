But then it just tuned off. booted again and it was on even shorter. now it's just spinning the fan for a few seconds and won't boot at all. Problem is, since it's so inconsistent it's hard to pin point the issue. Any ideas?\n\nThanks!"

It was visible on one screw hole by the USB ports. and on the Diagnostic port which I removed. \nI cant see any sign of liquid around those chips. Checked some of the power rails and they all look present. It's the SMC right? I'm screwed arent I haha"
