It is also shorted on the other side from the other set of CD3215's but the short stays on the U1200 side when isolated.  I am sure U3200 is smoked!  \n\n\nMy next step would be to change U3200 and U1200?\n\nI don't have much experience with this LB and would like advice from those who have been there.\n\nThanks\nRandall"
