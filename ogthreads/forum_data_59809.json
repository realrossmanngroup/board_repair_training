I\u2019m planing on selling the board and keeping the enclosure as a test enclosure I also got 5 other Items from the same seller these where just the boards all water damaged and all have this issue. I\u2019m guessing maybe the messed with bios thinking it might fix it? But all required some repairs other than bios.  So I\u2019m stuck at the same point with all these boards all powering up and booting. After board serializer all info is showing except \u201cmodel and year\u201d\n2- 820-3330 \n2-820-00165\n1-820-3437\nAnd this unit stated in title. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make a new thread I figured one question for all units would be easier. I tried with my test ssd and test hdd and nothing because I know these drives show year and model on other units. \nThank you"
