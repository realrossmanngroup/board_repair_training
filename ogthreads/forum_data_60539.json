            "message": "Hello!\n\nSomewhat new to this and just trying to get some direction.\n\nMacBook turns on, can use with external monitor, confirmed no backlight/can see an image when I use a flashlight.\n\nI have 0V on PPVOUT_S0_LCDBKLT\n\nMissing the enable signal for U7700. I checked where it gets the signal from and it looks like it's an OR gate, and needs either: EDP_BKLT_EN or LCD_PSR_EN to generate the enable. Both are missing. Both signals come from the SMC (I think). Anything I can do?"

I should have mentioned I tested the same thing earlier with resistance mode and confirmed it was not a bad cable/display.\n\nEDP_BKLT_EN and LCD_PSR_EN both pulse at about 1 or 2 mV very briefly when I supply power before going down to 0V (had only the power supply connected, nothing else) You mention that I should check for the pulse when I hear the chime, I feel like that entails that I need to have more than just the power supply connected (like the speakers, at least) for this particular test, but I'm not sure so I figured I'd include that information"
