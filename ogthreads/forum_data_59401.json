            "message": "Hi\nI have 820-3437 Logic Board\nAs soon as I plugged charger to this Board, R7005 Blow out. \nR7005  not short to Ground. I tested with New R7005 without D7005 it gives me roughly 20v on both ends. As soon I Install D7005 , R7005 blows out. \nNO sign of Liquid damage on motherboard. PPBus_G3H is also not short to ground, I checkd on F7140. I removed these components C7090, C7091, C7092, U7090   after D7005 no sign of short. Could't figure out what is shorting. I replaced new chip also U7100 still didn't solved my issue. I also replaced Q7180 for no reason.\nNow I need help where should I look.\nThanks in Advanced"
