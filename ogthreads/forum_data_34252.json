After I tried one from a 2012 3115 and didn't work, I was informed by duke that the IC has firmware on it. \nI found a link to some on Aliexpress: [url]https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20180501130529&SearchText=CY8C24794[/url]\nbut I wouldn't know how to program them if it has firmware. It looks like I need a CY8C24794 MLF-1 with Sym version 2, which in schematic shows its the same as the 3115, 2012.\n\nDoes anyone have a working 3662 or 3787 with a dead cpu or something and would be willing to sell me the u4801 off it? I can pay through paypal or venmo or something."
