            "message": "Hi, I have an 3115 that had no green light, I replaced Q5490 as it was black and the board came back to life got a green light again and 12.6v on PPBUS.. After I ultrasonic-ed it the green light was going on/off all the time like 3 seconds off, 1 second on. SMC_RESET_L is pulsing between 0 and 3.43v. PPBUS is moving between 3.3v and 9v and then reset. If I wait few minutes the fan starts to spin (high) but no chime yet."
