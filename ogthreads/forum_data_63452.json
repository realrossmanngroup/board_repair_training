Yes 3.30v when it power cycles on, Its still doing 8 seconds on 4 seconds off,\n\n( When measuring this i measured on R2013, Whilst doing so R2013 pinged off the board, hardly any pressure from my needle tip multi meter probes, Whilst grabbing a replacement R2013 from a donor board I notice that the fan is now spinning each time it power cycles on 4 sec on 4 sec off.,. (( It wasnt doing this before, Id just get a 4 sec fan spin then nothing from the fan unless I removed all power batt and charger then re applied it would spin for 4 sec then nothing at all. )) I replaced R2013 and it goes back to no fan spin when it power cycles just the one 4 sec spin when power first applied,\n\nI also noticed that when it's been on a while cpu gets warm but I also notice that L7030 is getting HOT! and it lookskinda strange with a white ring on it, see pic. \n[ATTACH]60934[/ATTACH]\n\nIt feels like this is trying it's best to start but I'm missing something daft here."
