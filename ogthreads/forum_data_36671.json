I would get no internal or external display, even with the internal display unplugged. I remove the board to start troubleshooting, now for some ungodly reason, I get no power, and 5v_s4 is not present. I get green light on mag safe/PPBUS/5v_S5. I am very perplexed as to what has happened here. I am 100% certain that I did not damage is board in any way by removing it from the housing. WTF"
