PPBUS goes to 12.58 then drops to 4v and shows OL, and then reboots. It cannot run only from battery. Onewire lines are all OK and3.42 is present. CPU Vcore comes on to 1.15 with fan spin. What to check next?\n\nSome measurements\n\nU7000 17/18 = 55.2ohm\nU7000 27/28 = 21 ohm\nACOK = present on pin 14.\nPin 3 ACIN = 3.9\nPin 2 DCIN = 16.58 - 16.16v"
