            "message": "hey guys. Been a while since posting. Must of learnt something!\nAm now stuck on a old 820-2580 board. Seconds away from giving up and this post is my last resort. \n\nPPBUS_G3H is not holding and is always changing values. From around 8v to 12.6v. \nF7040 is fine and I even changed U7000 off a working board. Same result. \nR7020 and R7050 are those sense resistors. I don't quite understand how they work although the readings seem fine. Can't find any shorts.\nPossible for some nudges in the right direction??\nThaks again."

            "message": "So here's an update.. ended up repalacing the board that caught fire. Bought a supposedly working board from eBay, Rnrcomputers to be precise. Long story short. This board doesn't work either. Has no green orange light. \n\nTook 3 weeks to arrive and really don't have time to send it back and wait so I thought I'd diagnose. Found CHGR_CSI_R_N between r7020 and r7022 missing. Jumped it. Got a green light and laptop powers up and all works bar an x for the battery. \n\nSo the smc is not seeing the battery I'm guessing.. And pins 4 and 6 on the battery connector are the lines that tell the smc there is a battery?? Am I on the track?\n\nu4900 creates smbus_smc_bsa_scl and goes to battery then to u7000\n\ni cant find any other tracks not present. Is this a dead u7000? Proper brain stuck now."
