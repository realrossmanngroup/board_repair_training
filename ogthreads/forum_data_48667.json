            "message": "820-4924 came in with no signs of liquid damage and no power on and no mag light. I left the board alone for 2 days while I worked on other repairs, and by the time I got to the board, I first plugged in magsafe and got a orange light. Light disappeared after a few seconds. I then removed magsafe and battery and held power button down for 10 seconds, reconnected power and got orange light and was able to boot machine to login screen. I decided to leave machine alone to charge up battery and noticed mage safe disappeared after a few minutes.\n\nNow device has orange light, and no boot. First thing I checked was All_SYS_PWRGD and noticed it was not present.\n\nPP3v42= 3.42v\nPPBUS = 12.6v\nPPVRTC_G3= 3.V\nPPVIN_S5= 12\n\nPP5V_S5 = 5V\nPP5V_S4 = 0\nPP3V3_S5= 3.3V\nPP3V3_S4= 0\n\nIt appears my PM_SLP_S5_L is not present so S4, S3, S0 rails are not present. Checked up the line and found PM_SLP_S5_L is created by U0500, so I looked into PM_PCH_PWROK and noticed it wasn't present either. I then noticed that PM_PCH_PWROK is created by the U1950 Logic Gate, which is enabled once ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present.\n\nI feel like I just went in a giant circle and was hoping for any advice on what I should be looking at next.\n\nThank you in advance."

I replaced U7501 and now the board will power on in SMC bypass mode will all rails present for a second then turn off, then power back on again after a few seconds, then power off again. I checked the current sensing resistors on ISL6925 and I am getting 21 ohms between Pins 27 and 28 on U7100, which seems normal, and 4 ohms between Pins 17 and 18.\n\nWithout smc bypass, PM_SLP_S4_L is missing. I am currently looking into the VRTC, BIOS and SMC sensors. Any other suggestions on what I should be looking into?\n\nThank you"
