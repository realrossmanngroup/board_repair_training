I understand that the Audio chip according to this change gets not anymore a signal from the audio Jack that it is plugged (while it in fact is not). \n\nCan you confirm from this that by changing the socket will the headset problem also be solved or you think that the problem can also on the PCB pads too?\n\nGreeting"
