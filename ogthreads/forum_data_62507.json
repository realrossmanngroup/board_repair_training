            "message": "Hello guys!\n\nI have a MacBook that had water damage. It had missing 20v which I fixed by replacing the type C chips and charging port. It had PPBUS_G3H, but no CPU core. Fixed it by replacing bad R7101 / C7101 and ran a wire to U7100 CPUVR_VIN. Now it boots, however it would never get past the  Apple logo with progress bar. I notice that I never get GPU core at any point during the OS loading.\n\nI was able to boot to linux with basic display drivers and so I imaged the SSD to back it up via dd command, but it seems like if I try to boot into the macOS, or installer it will just freeze up at a certain point. When I ran Apple diagnostics I would get the error VFD001 - \"There may be an issue with the display.\"\n\nWhat can be the issue? Could U7100 be partially bad? GPU MOSFETs? Anything else to check?"
