            "message": "Hello my name is Emre,\n\nI live in Antalya, Turkey and being an Apple Technical Service for a year. First of all I want to tell you a short story of my bussiness today. I was working in tourism right before the pandemic period. But when the pandemic started my company fired me because their all jobs cancelled. Then I have tried to find something for myself to gain some money. Suddenly I thought I can buy & sell ipads and iphones to make some profit. But on the very first ipad 2, I got my first problem. Bought it came home and checked how to reset it to the factory settings (I wasnt using any apple before) I found out that there is an icloud locked there. And searched how I can get rid of it and found the ways with dcsd cables. Then I bought an ipad with sim card in it ( didnt have any clue about imei ) :D so another story started for me. So found the resistors there to remove (never done any technical repairs before except changing my bulbs at home) And with reading a lot and watching videos, Today I can fix mainboards of nearly all Apple devices :) But still having problems sometimes with troubleshooting of the errors. So this is enough for me and get back to the subject :)\n\nI have my wife's A1707 macbook pro and ordered a battery 3 days ago. Changed it very well (I don't think that I have destroyed anywhere that time) but then I realised that macbook started to work so slow and did diagnostic and gave me PFM006 & PPN001 as everyone gets. But this didnt mean anything for me. So kept searching and found your video on youtube which shows kindly similiar problem. I have made an external mac os, run the hwmonitor and found only heatpipe incoming and outgoing air is around 128 degress. There is no damage on the card when I checked. I checked the trackpad and saw nothing there. Maybe Im missing of course something but really I couldn't find anywhere to look and Im totally new on macbooks. And the fans goes to the highest speed when mac os starts loading.\n\nAnyone can show me a way for this?\n\nThank you in advance\n\nEmre\n\nEdit: I have checked the new battery with coconut app and shows good for the battery too.\n\nEdit 2: Board has been tried with screen connector and trackpad connector plugged off and the result was same for both. And also Battery removed and same result. I have checked the voltages on R5390 and R5391 both have 3.3volts on their \"1\" pads.\n\nEdit 3: I have took out U5850 & U5800 and desoldered them but nothing changed.\n\nEdit4: Checked the voltages on U5820, getting 3.3v on 1,4 and 6 legs"

My trackpad is working well but as you mentioned (if trackpad not detected), does this mean it can work but still not detected? \n\nI have tried both the new battery connected and plugged out result is same. So can we say the problem will still go on until we connect a known good battery?\n\nOnly a know good battery may stop this issue?"
