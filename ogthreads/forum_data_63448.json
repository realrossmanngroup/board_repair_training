            "message": "So i've got an 820-01958 liquid damaged and it's stuck at 5V 0A - it's been ultrasonic cleaned and looks good now. Only real area of corrosion was around U6960 where we had R6960 loose and has been replaced. All other resistors are connected and measuring normally. \n\nPPBUS_G3H is 12.3V\nDevice is not detected in DFU mode when connected to another mac\nPP3v3_G3H_RTC is missing and is not shorted to ground\nCHGR_EN_MVR is also missing and is not shorted to ground\nU6960 has been removed and resoldered - there was no corrosion underneath.\n\nUnsure about this one as 12.3v PPBUS would indicate T2 communication issue but also got missing PP3V3_G3H_RTC and i'm not sure if that should only come up after PPBUS voltage goes up."
