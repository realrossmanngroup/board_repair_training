After the weekend they tried powering it on and it wouldn't do anything according to them.\n\nAll voltages look fine to me. Checked all rails on the 'power aliases' page in the schematic. This includes RAM voltages if I'm not mistaken.\n\nAny point in trying a fresh BIOS? If so, do you know where to get a good bin?"
