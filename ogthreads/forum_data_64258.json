            "message": "MacBook Pro 2019 A2141 820-01700 NAND Issue Stuck in DFU\n\nOk, here's an issue ive got on a A2141 820-01700 MBP 16' 2019. No signs of life, 5.06v 0.0a on usb-c meter, on each 4 usb-c ports. \n\nNand voltages are missing. \n\nI've found no shorts at all so far, no signs of heat via thermal camera either. \n\nPPBUS_G3H 12.31\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC 3.387v\nPP3V3_G3H 12.31v\nPP2v5_NAND_SSD0 0v 58 ohms\nPP2v5_NAND_SSD1 0v 57.8 ohms\nPP1v8_SLPS2R 1.8v\nPP1v1_SLPS2R 1.1v\nP3V3_G3H_SOCPMU 3.37v\nPP0V9_SLPDDR 0.9v\n\nP3v3_UPC_XA LDO 3.3v\nPP3v3_UPC_XB_LDO 3.3v\nPP3v3_UPC_TA_LDO 3.3v\nPP3v3_UPC_TB_LDO 3.3v\n\nTried revive and restore via apple configurator, fails every time with 4014. Device is detected in DFU mode without me forcing it, booting into it by itself, but i've noticed P2v5_NAND_SSD0/P2v5_NAND_SSD0 ramping up to 2.5v 1 second when trying restore/revive, then back to zero. So it's trying to power on the NANDS, but shutting them off after.\n\nAnyone has an idea at this point ? Thanks."
