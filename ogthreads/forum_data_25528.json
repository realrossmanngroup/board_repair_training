            "message": "Good day, I am a newb.  liquid damaged board, CPU not getting warm.  while reading forums for some help I looked at this section of the board to check for corrosion around U5110.  I noticed these resistors are gone.  R5116 and R5101.  I believe this would explain why I cannot reset SMC but do not know.  I looked at schems and do not believe that the lack of these resistors would cause no chime. no boot.  I am looking for advice on best way to check for missing voltage to allow MBA to post.  Any advice appreciated, please.  ALL_SYS_PWRGD is present 3.3v"

            "message": "I am curious, it appears that many of the Main Logics have the same power circuitry.  Is there a defined efficient way to check in order power rails quickly to determine what exactly is missing?  On U1950 on this board after looking at the logic breakdown of the chip and then looking at schematics I noticed many of the power rails were the same throughout the board.  Is there a voltage divider that takes the AC in and splits all these power rails? There has to be some power regulation/creator circuitry that pumps out all needed voltages...  Sadly, Because I am a newb and learning slowly I cannot find this in the schems...  is there test point locations on the board that breaks out these voltages?"
