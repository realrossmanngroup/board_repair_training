            "message": "Hi there Louis, Duke, and everyone else helping out. Thank you for this great resource.\nI have an 820-3115 giving me a headache. Probably current spike killed it.\nAmong others, L6995 was damaged, ISL and SMC were both shorted to ground. Many resistors were off (reading incorrectly).\nAfter replacing all the above and then some more (this was my most complex attempt yet and some other components may have been replaced without need).\nNow will start and charge from battery that is holding a charge, but will charge extremely slow. Won't start and charge a dead battery. Will quarter spin without a battery.\nI can't think of anything more to look for.\nWhat rails or lines should I check and report about?\nTIA!\nEDIT: I remembered two important incidents. When I thought I fixed everything at the beginning, except ISL because I did not yet have them in stock, I borrowed one from a laptop that came in for a different issue and my laptop seemed to function properly, except I don't remember using a flat or full battery. It booted to a flashing folder. So I put the ISL back and waited for Louis to send me the ISLs I ordered from his website.\nThen I was able to get a known good donor board. Harvested the ISL and installed it. Plugged the MagSafe improperly aligned (saw a spark) and probably (??) fried the one wire circuit. Started replacing a bad resistor and caused a spark THEN noticed that I had foolishly left the MagSafe attached as I was mad at my 1st mistake. Later after that replaced all the bad resistors I could find as well as the ISL with a new one, and ended up with the problem described above in the title. Not knowing if I caused more damage or this was never solved to begin with."

Now my tech who was working on this told me that he replaced current sense resistors before and they would soon fail. It could be true because I don't think he'd miss R7051 being that off.\nI replaced it, and also touched up the pins on the ISL because pins 15-20 seemed a bit off, missing solder.\nPlugged it in with the flat battery that came with it, and I get green then amber light using 85W adapter. But the more I add components, the less time the fans and laptop stay on.\n27/28 now 20.5 Ohm.\n17/18 now 3.1 Ohm.\nWith everything plugged in => quarter spins and reboots.\nWith HDD and DVD disconnected => chimes, screen lights, then turns off and reboots.\nI am guessing \"something\" is not putting out enough power. I am hunting for this now, although I have no experience with this part of the circuit yet.\nHope someone can point me in the right direction, seeing that I've had this board for so long and would love to hand it back before it celebrates it's anniversary at my workshop."
