            "message": "Hi,\nI got recently this MacBook with no charging issue. \nI've use 820-00239 schematic diagram to check out the board. \nLaptop was liquid damaged around L3500, U3100. I replaced all liquid damaged components and reball U3100 because laptop didn't take charge on one c-type port voltage didn't go up to 20V after it laptop still did not take charge on this port stays on 5v only. I decided to replace CD3215 after replacement issue persist plus laptop is charging intermittent on other ports.. \nI am not to familiar with those boards I checked under microscope board all looks good, I've removed this ic and issue persist voltage from charger stays on 5v on rest of ports . \n\nThanks for advice"
