There was some repair done around R6061 so there was some issue with SSD - tested another SSD and SSD is visible.\n\nFan runs at max RPM immediately after power on. \nBoard + DC board only still same issue so dont think it is linked with trackpad and ASL.\nMac is not laggy. In iStat 'CPU System Agent Core'  show correct temp but after a few minutes 0 degree and then still shows correct temp.\nTried SMC reset/bypass and still the same.\n\nAny idea?"
