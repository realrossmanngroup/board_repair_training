HW monitor shows no abnormal behavior activity monitor shows kernel task up to 400% i even checked all the sensors resistors and nothing is damaged. When running safe mode it works just fine.\n\ni have now 2 other boards with this issue and getting to the bottom of it would help greatly. Maybe i can apply the same fix to the rest.\n\nasd returned no errors at this point im thinking maybe smc is damaged. Has anyone else fixed this issue by replacing smc?"
