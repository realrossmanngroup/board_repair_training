            "message": "Hi, I seem to be in 'brain off modee' again, so ill ask here.\n\n820-4924 runs of a battery however states no battery installed. Sometimes it recognises the battery at 99% but that quickly changes to 'service battery' and then a cross.\n\nIve tried a new battery. SDA jumps from 3.42V to 0V then back to 3.42V in a really strange manor. D7050 replaced, no change, ISL6259 replaced No change, SMC replaced no change. Battery connector removed to check for corrosion and was clean. Pull up resistor checked and is fine, Traces to the pullup resistor checked with no issues. \n\nScratching my head a bit, What am i missing?"

I looked at the pullups under a microscope and noticed a micro break between a probe point and the SDA trace that runs  to the SMC i cut the mask of the trace with a razor blade and used 0.1mm magnet wire to solder directly to the trace. \n\nAll working now. Knew i was missing something stupid aha."
