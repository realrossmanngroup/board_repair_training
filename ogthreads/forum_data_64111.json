            "message": "Hi guys. \n\nI have this A1707 with no power stuck at 20V 0amps. No liquid damage. The ISL9239(U7000) was heating up a bit and I replaced it, one contact under it was gone, Pin 36 TBA_GATE_Q1. Also, I have replaced U3200 cause it was heating up. Now I have the same state no power 20v. I noticed that PPBUS_G3H is not going up and stays at 0.8v up to 1v variation, and there's no short measurement with diode mode. U4200 had some dust and looks funny on the edges it peeled off. The strange thing that I found on the board\nit's a component under R4308 which is not on the board view, but I'm guessing on the schematics it's XW4300 and it should be going to ground.  \n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated, thank you \ud83d\ude4f\n\n [ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"319px\" alt=\"A1707 ISL\"]61265[/ATTACH]"
