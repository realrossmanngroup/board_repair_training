            "message": "Got a customer come in with broken screen.  Replaced the screen but now it doesn't charge, but said he was having issues with charging anyway.  I replaced the magsafe and have only gotten orange light for about 30 seconds before it fades out.  I took out the 820-3536-a logic board and noticed a few burned out filters.  I tried re-flowing them but looks like they need to be replaced.  I couldn't find a schematic for the logic board with a google search so was hoping you could point me to the right direction to get a replacement.  Do these two filters have anything to do with charging?"
