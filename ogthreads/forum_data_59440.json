I swapped the BT/WiFi module with another one and still the same. Wifi works, USB works as well but no BT. I cheched the path from J3401 to U3700 and it's fine and consistent. PP3V3_S3_BT_F is also present (3,29v). on USB_BT_N I measure about 0,32V and on USB_BT_P I get about 0,30V. Trackpad and camera are fine too.\nAny suggestion about what else I should have look for?"
