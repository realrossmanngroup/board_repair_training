            "message": "Hey everybody,\n\nI am having display issues on a Apple MacBook \"Core M\" 1.1 12\" (Early 2015), the computer turns on fine and you can here it when you use the volume up-down. However, I am struggling very much to find:\n\na) The board serial number\nb) A boardview/schematic for the board\n\nThe only serial-type number I have found is on the keyboard connector, 821-1935, however I don't believe this to be the correct number. I am unable to find any other numbers like the usual board serials on there.\n\nSo my questions are:\na) Where can I find the board serial number on a Apple MacBook \"Core M\" 1.1 12\" (Early 2015)\nb) Any cheeky pointers to where I could source a schematic would be appreciated but not expected :)\n\nThanks"
