On visual inspection i notice that the coil near the display lvds connector is broken.\nI can't find that coil on the boardview neither on schematics. However, i found one coil just on that position (L2920) on the boardview of the 820-00163-A.\n\nMy problem is that i don't have any other scrap board like this one, and don't know were to find that coil to replace it. Can you help?"

Something very strange is happening:\nOnce again, after i replaced the J8300 the backlight works for a day or two, but than it stops working.I gues that is someting related with the temperature applied (just guessing).\nAny idea of what mite be causing this behaver?"
