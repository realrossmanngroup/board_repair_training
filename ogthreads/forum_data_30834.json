I can't remember a time when it wasn't the CPU. Is there anything else I should look for before letting this go? The board looks mostly clean, but the customer reported it as a spill. R7202 looks like it probably got hit. PPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING wasn't shorted. Board is cycling. PP5V_S0 is cycling. Fan will occasionally spin up when power is applied."
