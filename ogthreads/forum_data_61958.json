(Source: [URL]https://repair.wiki/w/A1932_2018_-_2019_MacBook_Air[/URL] - power sequence) \u2026 mine is 0V.\n\nCPUCORE_PHASE1 = cant measure it .... AUTORANGE is looping on my multimeter but PPVCORE_SO_CPU_PH1 is present....strange.\n\nedit2:\nMaybe the U7100, U7410 or U7430 are faulty?\n\nU7100:\n- CPUGT_IMON = 0V\n- CPUGT_NTC = 0.8V\n- CPUGT_COMP = 4.6V\n- CPUGT_FB = 0V\n- CPUGT_RTN = 0V\n- CPUGT_ISUMP = 0V\n- CPUGT_ISUMN_R = 0V\n- CPUGT_ISEN1 =  0V\n- CPUGT_ISEN2 = 0V\n- CPUGT_FCCM = 5V\n- CPUGT_PWM1 = 5V\n- CPUGT_PWM2 = 5V\n\nU7410/U7430:\n- CPUGT_PHASE1 = 0V\n- CPUGT_PHASE2 = 0V\n- PP5V_S0_CPUGT1 = 5V\n- PP5V_S0_CPUGT2 = 5V\n- CPUGT_BOOT1_RC = 0V\n- CPUGT_BOOT2_RC = 0V\n- CPUGT_BOOT1 = 4.6V\n- CPUGT_BOOT2 = 4.6V\n- CPUGT_GL1 = 0V\n- CPUGT_GL2 = 0V\n- PP5V_G3S = 5V\n- PPBUS_HS_CPU = 12.58V\n\nI assume PPVCCGT_S0_CPU is important for the internal GPU, isn\u2019t it?
