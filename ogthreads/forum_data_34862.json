Is there anywhere i can jumpstart the laptop?\nor is there any other problem u might suggest I do beforehand?\n\nThanks"

What does that reading tell you?[/QUOTE]\n\nWell to start, you have the polarity inverted. Red probe (positive) should go on F7140 and Black on ground (negative) in an optimal case, but for voltage we can just ignore the negative (-) indicator for now.\n\n0.999 m what? 0.999mV? 0.999mOhm?\n\nLet us know the voltage on PPBUS_G3H with power applied and your multimeter set to Voltage mode (The \"V\" indicator, just to be sure: don't use the \"mV\" for this one). If you know how to, also report back the voltage of PP3V42_G3H.\n\nAlso I agree with [USER=\"1309\"]Inwerp[/USER], you should probably check some of louis's introduction videos"
