            "message": "So tonight I have an 820-2936 on the bench from a customer who states they are having charging issues. They claim sometimes the battery will charge and sometimes it will not. So I took off the bottom and check the current sense resistors and they measure the correct values vs the schematic. I did take note that is it a knock off battery (Ansanour). Funny thing happens, when I try to turn the power off without an Apple OG Magsafe the computer will not turn on. When I plug Magsafe in it boots up. The battery indicator is saying 100% but as soon as I unplug the MS the computer shuts off. I put an older original Apple battery in and the computer will start on battery and MS. If I unplug the MS the computer stays running. The current battery level is steadily going down from 97% to 92%. My question is, is this simply a case of a bad battery? they said they have replaced it a couple times.\n\nBoard looks super clean also."
