            "message": "Hello,  I have a 820-3332 with liquid damage. I have never worked on one of these boards before. The only thing I can see visually is Q8930 which isn't looking too good nor is plane around it. I see what look like many little vias next to it which have lifted along with the res of the exposed circuit. Im wondering if this is even repairable because I'm not sure where any of them go. Is this even worth me getting a donor board for? I don't see any other damage anywhere on the board at all. Is this something that is common to fail and does it kill any other components along with it?"
