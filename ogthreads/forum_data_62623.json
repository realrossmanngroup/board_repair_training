Popped it under the thermal camera and the only thing which is heating slightly is U9080 - nothing visible shorted on the NAND power lines either. \n\nS5 voltages are present but cannot see any S3 or S0 voltages coming up. \n\nReplacing U9080 should fix this issue or is there something else likely going on here? Still not seen many of these style boards!"
