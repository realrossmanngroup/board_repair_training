            "message": "Issue: Mac runs very slow.\nNo drop or liquid damage I'm aware of, board has normal dust but overall looks good.\nASD continually fails the palmrest temp sensor test and the CPU thermal test. Fans spin up shortly after boot and stay on high.\n\nTested with different KG trackpads (and their respective flex cables), palmrest sensor fails remain. Tested with other batteries as well as I was changing the trackpad anyway, this of course made no difference.\n\nLooking at the schematic and bv, I can't figure out which pin on J5800 is responsible for carrying the temp sensor signal. As I don't want to start a 3 hour wild goose chase, figured I'd come and ask here first: where do I start? :)"

I'd say try another screen to rule it out (I've had screens be fine except the webcam cable be damaged) and if that doesn't work, I'd say leave it unplugged. Webcam is not worth messing with if it's board level unless the connector is physically damaged and causing the issue."
