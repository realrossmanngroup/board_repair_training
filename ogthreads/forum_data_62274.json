            "message": "I have a water damage 820-01949-A logicboard. it had damage on the U3100_x area. I replaced R3070, R3058, R3057, R3072, R3033, and C3101_x\nwhen I connect a charger I get 20V and it goes up to 0.79A then the Apple logo comes on but it'll be stuck on the logo and goes down to 0.40A, 0.30A, and A jumps up and down. Also, I noticed the D3100_x is damaged as well but I can't find D3100_X(NSR20F40NX_G) online to replace it. Would it be alright if I take it off and test the board or any advice on where I should look for?\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60395[/ATTACH]"
