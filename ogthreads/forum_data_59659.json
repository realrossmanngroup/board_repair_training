            "message": "Hello everybody!\n\nOkay, so I should start this off by saying I am VERY new at this. I recently bought an A1466 MacBook Air on eBay to try and fix. When I got it, it powered on ONCE. It booted to the question mark folder & I was able to get it to start booting into internet recovery (No OS). I left the room while it was booting, but when I came back (Less than 5 minutes later), it was dead. Now, the seller did tell me he was able to get it powered on once as well but died on him too.  I was powering it off of my DC Power supply, and it was drawing 0.09A while dead. \n\n I figured out that PM_SLP_S4_L was missing (0V), so I started troubleshooting. Now, when I got the board, it was VERY obvious someone else had been working on it. A good portion of the board was covered in flux along with some missing screws. I found out that C1910 has become a wire, so I replaced it with one from a donor board (820-3437). After that, I ended up replacing U5620, U1950 & U1900 because they looked pretty rough. That seemed to have brought PM_SLP_S4_L back. Now when I plug the board in, It draws between 0.20 - 0.40A. I've seen it at 0.40A most of the time, but occasionally lower. When I went to plug it in right before typing this, it went to 0.20A. Keep in mind while it's drawing that the fan is going at full speed. \n\nSo, the question now is how bad did I mess up my board lol. Does anybody know what else I should try? Is it bad to take chips off a board with a different board number? As far as I know, 00165 & 3437 are very similar, so I don't think it should be an issue, but as I've said, I don't know much about this. Does anybody know what I should check/try next? Any and all help is appreciated! If I'm doing something wrong, please tell me! Thanks everybody!"
