            "message": "Hello. Got this board from another store. It has already been poked/cleaned, so I don't have its history. Apparently no missing components. If I plug USB-C charger I get 5V on FB200 and F3000 does't matter if the USB-C cable is reversed or not. On the other 2 fuses I only get 5V if it's on an specific side, if I reverse it I get 0V. All ports, when they get 5V they keep reseting the USB-C Amp Meter cycling. Already tried replacing UB300 on the dark as I'm suspecting one of the controllers is bad, but don't want to replace them all to find out it was the very last one that was bad. I could not find any shorts on the board, as commonly found on this model."
