After that the current in to the machine didnt rise over 3.6A\n\nSo I thought everything fine, gave it back the client. machine came in today with the same problem.\n\n\nSo i replaced u7100 and R7121/2, after that again no short but on mac safe no green/orange light, machine working good.\n\nSo I still replaced the DC-in conector. After that I got green/orange light. current in to the machine again until 3.6A\n\nSo I still have any idea what can be here the problem. I think, if I will give it back to the client it will break again.\n\nIs it possible that the dc-in still was broken and that was the main reason?\n\nis 20V on the laboratory-unit correct for A1398 2015 ?"
