            "message": "Hi,\n\nstubborn board again. So I got it with not turning on problem. No liquid damage, but had replaced backlight IC before, the rest looks good. There is green and orange light on MagSafe, but fan doesn\u2019t spin, just try to start and stops (Quarter fan spin). PPBUS_G3H ~4v, not shorted. I\u2018ve checked the area of U7000 (ISL6259) and adapter current sensing resistors R7021/22 were blown (resistance in kohm, the battery side was measuring 2,2ohm). I\u2019ve replaced them along with ISL, resistance between R7021/22 got 20ohm. After connecting adapter had no fan spin though PPBUS raised to 8,56v. It turned out, that adapter resistors blew again, so I\u2019ve replaced ISL and resistors again. This time board started, so I decided to put it in topcase and test it. Another adapter connection blew the resistors again, PPBUS dropped to ~4v... I\u2019ve checked all components on page 53 of schematic... R7005 measures 20ohm, R7020 and R7050 are ok, C7020 is ok... I\u2019ve replaced all set again and tried with battery only - no reaction. I\u2019ve tried with different MagSafe boards and I/O cables - it keeps burning these resistors and ISL... I\u2019ve also checked voltage rails for shorts and haven\u2019t found any... just because board started after one of ISL/resistors replacement I believe power rails are not the actual problem here. Do you have any suggestions?"

Sometimes it just doesn't react at all, sometimes it's pulsing. \n\nWhile measuring ALL_SYS_PWRGD on R2584 it turned on twice, behaving like while normal board start - CPU got warm, fan was speeding up because of no trackpad connected. After I took probe off R2584 and touched it again, board turned off then started again. I replugged charger and now it's just pulsing."
