            "message": "Hi guys, first post here.\n\nThis A1466 - 820-00165 display starts flickering and blinking a few moments before the end of system bar startup running. When the login screen appears, I almost can't see. This is not happening with the external monitor. Tried a new display and the same happens. If I log in and activate the Colors filter, everything works fine again, but the screen gets dark if I don't touch the mouse or keyboard after a few seconds.\n\nAfter a few days checking this board, I noticed that this flickers starts when vcore drops on both inductors L7310 / L7320. Any Idea?"
