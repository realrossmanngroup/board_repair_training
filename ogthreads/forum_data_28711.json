            "message": "If the values are similar enough and you can make it fit it should be alright for resistors and capacitors.\n\nMore advanced components like transistors are possible, but keep in mind not every transistor is alike. Many have slightly different specifications so always compare the datasheets, when in doubt just buy the right chip or a donor board with a matching part."
