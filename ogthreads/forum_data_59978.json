            "message": "The fan on this MBA does not go through the normal start, stop, start, stop, start sequence. Instead, it starts for about 10 seconds, stops briefly and then spins continuously. \n\nAll S_0 rails are present, but PPVVC_S0_CPU is a bit low (1.7V, should be 1.8V). PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK out of U1950 is present. The following have been replaced: SMC, clock chip (U1900), and BIOS chip. Still no boot after replacement. The following signals are all present: PM_DSW_PWRGD, PM_RSMRST_L, PM_SYSRST_L, PM_PWRBTN_L. From reading through previous threads, it seems like the next logical thing to do would be to upload a new good BIOS to the computer (I believe I will have to do this anyway since I replaced the BIOS chip). Could someone please outline the steps I need to take in order to do this as well as provide the file? \n\nOne other thing of note: U3900 has been mentioned in past posts. This chip does heat up noticeably when the board is powered on, but not to the point that I can't keep my finger on it."

Every Macbook brought back to life is one new sale taken away from Apple. \n\nThis board had some liquid damage through the back near the BIOS chip. U1950 was destroyed. After replacing that I got PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK back. \n\nPLT_RESET_L is not present. \nI checked all 16 SPI Bus Series Termination resistors and the associated traces. Everything is ok there. \n\nI extracted the .rar file and got a binary file. How do I upload that into the BIOS chip?"

The computer has exactly the same symptoms as before... fan spins, stops and then just keeps spinning. No boot.\n\nPLT_RESET_L is still missing. At the top of pg. 13 of the schematic (820-3437), it shows the signals going into the PCH that are required to obtain PLT_RESET_L. I have all of the required inputs. I decided to apply some flux to the PCH and heat. I kept heating for about 15 seconds after the flux started to bubble. After doing this the computer still would not boot. \n\nThe last thing I tried was wiring 3.3V to PLT_RESET_L to force it to be present (I first checked for a short to ground on the line... there wasn't one). After forcing 3.3V into PLT_RESET_L, the computer still will not boot. \n\nSuggestions?"
