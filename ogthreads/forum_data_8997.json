It does mean that I cannot rely on your measurements though cause they are obviously wrong.\nBut BKLT_PWM is not there if you measured correctly. Do a PRAM reset and see if it comes on. May need to do it a few times and power off and boot into OSX. Then try to turn up the brightness on the keyboard."
