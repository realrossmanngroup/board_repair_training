            "message": "I'm working on 820-3476 which came for no power. It had some slight corrosion on JTAG, around R7202, U7600, some on C3201 area and really small stain on U6100. I have removed JTAG, cleaned eveything, replaced damaged resistors, caps, resoldered chips (U6100 too). Computer turns on, works on battery and on the charger. Problem is, that SOMETIMES when I turn it off it will not turn on from power button. I have to reconnect battery, then it starts working again for some time. It olny happens when battery is conected. When on charger power button works every time. I have tried new keyboard, new battery and even replaced SMC with new one. Sadly there is no differenece... Diagnostisc shows no errors, when computer is on it works perfectly fine.."

            "message": "I have cleaned that area, replaced U5110. Still the same. After plugging battery SMC_RESET_L is 2,8V. This time when I plugged charger  there was a chime but no image or backlight on the screen. I have measured SMC_LID: when lid is opened voltage is stable 2,6V, when cloesd it' jumping between 0,113V to 1,10V. After performing PRAM and SMC reset the image is back and SMC_LID voltage is 0,9-1,1V wneh lid closed. I have noticed, that if I perform SMC reset it always powers up with power button. Could be another bad SMC?"
