            "message": "this laptop came with water damage got it to power on and everything works fine but the fan spin rises and stays loud. i tried 3 different smcs. 1 smc was from the model with less ram but of course it didnt work correctly although the fan speed stayed normal. then i tried 2 smcs of the same model board and fan spin stays high. Hardware monitor gives normal thermal readings only finstack and airport give 129 degrees but i read on other forums that airport showing 129 is normal and of course the finnstack as well im totally stuck.\n\nany ideas??"
