The problem is this, the MacBook does not turn on the first time, you need to press several times, the fan will scroll for a second, the power-on sound appears and that's it. Where to dig? What can be connected with? voltage jumps on CHGR_LX1, at first 12v is unstable, then drops to 0, rises to 12, drops to 4.1v, sometimes to 3.7v"
