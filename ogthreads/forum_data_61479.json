This is my first post here:) I am working on an 820-00850 that is taking 20v, 50-70 milliamps. \n\nPP3V3_G3H: 3.36v\nPPBUS_G3H 12.56V \n\nThe schematic I have says PPBUS rails have to be 13.1v, however on previous models of MacBook Pros, it is 12.6 that is normal. Am I correct in that PPBUS is fine or do I have a short somewhere? Also, I have tried a DFU reset and restore in Apple Configurator 2. The target Mac is recognized and enters DFU mode. However, waiting an hour or more, the host mac states that it is still installing and I get no activity out of the target mac. \n\nAny ideas?"
