Nothing changed. Still no booting up. I inspected the audio board wich appears to be fine with no traces of liquid spill and also no shorts on the main caps. The bottom side still well coated and didn't feel to screew it up with furthure investigations at this time. When battery disconnected I get 20V/ 0,04 amps reading. When battery is connected I get (on both USB-C ports) 20V 1,74A reading from the voltage meter."
