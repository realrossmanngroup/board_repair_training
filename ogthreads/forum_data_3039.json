I UCed it before starting with it.\n\nI measured:\n\nLCDBKLT_EN_L to be HIGH which means Q7706 does not produce PPBUS_SW_BKL\n\nLCD_PWR_EN is HIGH which means the LCD is detected (?)\n\nAlso PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD_ISNS is ok\n\nPPVIN_S0_LCDBKLT at 13V\n\nAlso PP5V_S0_BKLTCTRL present at C7750 and R7743 - R7744.\n\nThere is continuity from R7700 to Pins 9 & 10 of U7701.\n\nExternal monitor shows image without issues.\n\n\n(Irrelevant question: This one turns on only when the battery is connected - is this normal behavior?)\n\n\nPlease kick me to the right direction. Or punch me or use a 9mm and aim the shoulder.\n\n\ngeorge"

Can the symptoms in this case explain a bad LCD? I am asking since I do not have a spare one at the moment but I can try and source one if there is meaning to it.\n\nthank you for all your help."

Before messing with the board you should eliminate a bad LCD assembly. Or if there is obvious corrosion on the backlight chip then you can look there first of course."
