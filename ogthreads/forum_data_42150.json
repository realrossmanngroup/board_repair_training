            "message": "Hi\nI had this board as completly dead because of water damage, so I've fixed everything to the point i wanted to test that board in the chassis:\nI had no backlight, so I checked the fuse which was dead then I replaced it ( what a BIG MISTAKE )\nWhen I turned the board ON again, fume came out of the board and the blew again.\nIt completly melted the plastic of the LCD connector with the one of the lcd cable, so I'll have to replace the LCD cable.\n\nBut my concern is more to fix the backlight first:\n\nThe resistance of PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT to GND is 14.2 Ohms VS 4.8 KOhms for known good board\nIn diode mode with red probe to gnd I have for the same rail: 0.012v VS 0.570V for a know good board\n\nSo I suspected U7701 and L7701 and I removed i them but I had the same reading.\n\nNow I would like to remove C7796 C7797 and C7799 maybe one of them is \"leaking to ground\".\nWhat do you think? or you would advise me something else?"
