First it came as not turning on and it had a short on U3210, replaced and solved.\n\nNow it came without any light on those LEDS.\n\nI bought a new PSU and same behavior NO LIGHTS\n\nI dissamble it and measure those resistors around the LED lights\n\nPP3V3_S5\nPP3V3_S4\n\nBEEPING TO GROUND - WHICH I GUESS IS HORT TO GROUND.\n\nI then used my external psu to inject voltage at PP12V_G3H... Which was in short...\n\nI saw a small smoke and turn off..\n\nThen tried again it was in short for a few seconds and then it was gone... I guess something went bad in this process...\n\nAnyhow now I do have NO SHORT at PP12V_G3H\n\nbut still short at PP3V3_S5 and PP3V3_S4 and NO LED lights... Anywhere to go?"
