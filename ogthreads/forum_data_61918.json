Customer also just worked on the machine, no issues, besides from it not wanting to go to sleep.\nI cannot find any corrosion other then some dusty areas, but none of them seem to be around crucial areas.\nU3200 seems to not work; when i connect charger, nothing shows on USBC Amp meter. (no bootlooping either).\n\nWhere can i start?\nWhen i connect to the adjacent port, i get 20v for PPDCIN_G3H at q3200.\nI have no luck with these devices, so some pointers are more than welcome please:)"
