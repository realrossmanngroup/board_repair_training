LCI indicators are all triggered. Cleaned with alcohol and inspected through microscope for any burned evidence.  When power is applied I get an orange light, fan spin and a battery charge icon on the LCD panel.  After a few seconds it shuts down.  No light on USB mouse when plugged in during start up.  Haven't worked on one of these before so any pointers would be helpful on where to start."
