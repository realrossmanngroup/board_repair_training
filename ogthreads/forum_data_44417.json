            "message": "Hmm ok. First thing to try would be the charger. If that doesn't produce VCore, then this one might suck a little bit. I suspect their is a chance it was not quite dry under the CPU/RAM/any of the BGA chips, and it might need a second cleaning. PM_BATLOW_L is one of the sleep signals that enables the PCH to turn on, and it comes directly from the SMC. Usually, when that is missing, we have seen the 2015 boards refuse to put it out if the charger is not 100% the correct OEM charger it needs. It is also possible that something could be pulling it down or not creating it (SMC, CPU etc). This can sometimes happen due to crap under the CPU/SMC as well."
