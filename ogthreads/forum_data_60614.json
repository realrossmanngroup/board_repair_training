I have tried two dumps I had, computer works on them but very slowly with fans running on max speed. I've tried cleaning ME Region, but it doesn't change anything. Can I ask you to share celan EFI for this board? The configuration from the board sticker is 2.5G MIC 16G MIC 2G. Thank you in avance!"

I takes around 30 seconds from the moment I press power button for the board to chime and show Apple logo. I have inspected the board for corrosion or other damages and haven't found anything except mentioned traces of EFI chip which I have already repaired. In the past I had similar behaviour cases of 820-00165 which turned out had bad EFI. Do you have celan EFI for this board? If yes, I would be thankful if you could share it."
