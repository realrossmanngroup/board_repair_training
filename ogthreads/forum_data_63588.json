He said that the laptop was always and only serviced by Apple Store. It appears that they already replaced the screen and the motherboard :LOL:))))\n\nWhen I opened it I was shocked : several screws were missing and others were all over the board. One screw was stuck between pin 1 and 2 of the R7020 and C8036 was destroyed !! (pics attached)\n\n[B]MEASUREMENTS :[/B]\nI pulled the board out and replaced R7020 and C8036 and was getting 20V and the apms were getting up to 0.70 and resetting to 0.05, basically looping.\n\nI started to do some measurement around U7000 (C7078 and C7020) and suddenly (I might have short-circuited smth) i'm getting only 5V at 0.05A\n\nOther measurement I did\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 0v\nPP5V_LDO5V - 0v\nPP3V3_S5 - 0v\nPP5V_S4 - 0v\nPP1V2_S3 - 0v\nSMC_RESET_L - 0v \n\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO - 3.3V\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDO - 1.79V\nPP1V1_UPC_XB_LDO_BMC - 0V\nPP1V8_UPC_XB_LDOD - 1.79V\n\nPP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO - 3.3V\nPP1V8_UPC_XA_LDO - 1.79V\nPP1V1_UPC_XA_LDO_BMC - 0V\nPP1V8_UPC_XA_LDOD - 1.79V\n\nC7078 - 5V\nD6905 - pin1 - 0V, pin2 - 5V, pin3 - 5;V\n\nThank you for all your support\n\nBest regards"
