SDA/SCL lines diode tests good and resistors are good.\n\nNo edp_bklt_en. Discovered cap broken but still present next to U8500. Replaced it C8504 and U8500. Getting 5V on pin 6 U8500. \n\nAlso diode of L8410 .8 with screen connected.\n\nChecked resistance R9827 it is good.no signs of liquid or anything odd at SMC."
