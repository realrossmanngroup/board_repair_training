            "message": "Hello,\n\n\nI replaced the battery (Battery Model A1705) for my Macbook 12\" 2017 (Macbook Model A1534 - EMC 3099). After battery replacement, the trackpad and keyboard and audio no longer work and laptop speed is slower than before replacement and only the power button is working well.\n\nResult of Macbook Diagnostics: PFM006 and PPN001\n\nTo fix it, I just purchased a replacement for all flat cables such as keyboard and trackpad, LCD, audio, power and replaced all flats cables with care, The Issue not resolved, so I purchased a replacement trackpad and keyboard and replaced them carefully, But the issue is still not resolved.\n\n\nBy research, I found out the reason for the slow speed of the laptop is maybe the CPU on SMC mode and not using all power for safety and protection, As the keyboard is not working, I can not do SMC reset, I just connected the external keyboard and mouse, they are working well, tried to do SMC via external keyboard but it seems not possible or maybe I do not know how to do it exactly.\n\n\nBy the way, with the SMC reset my issue may still remain, So if you have any experience with this issue or if you have any recommendation and solutions please let me know.\n\n\nThank you."
