            "message": "Serial number editing of the BIOS will result in its checksum not matching up, however this should resolve itself if apple pushes a BIOS update. The functionality of the device is not impacted by it usually. If it works right now you may keep the BIOS\n\nBad or re-used ME region might give issues later and I do recommend to get a clean one.\n\nI honestly might write a tutorial for this someday because this question gets asked a lot, but here is quickly explained how you do this:\n\n1. Download MEAnalyzer from: [URL=\"https://www.win-raid.com/t596f39-Intel-Management-Engine-Drivers-Firmware-amp-System-Tools.html\"]https://www.win-raid.com/t596f39-Int...tem-Tools.html[/URL]\n2. Dump the SPI flash to file and open this with MEAnalyzer, it will tell what engine version you're using.\n2.1 Download this engine version AND appropriate \"ME system tools\" from the win-raid website\n3. Unpack the ME system tools and open Flash Image Tool\n3.1 Open the old .ROM in Flash Image Tool and Go to File > Save As and save the current config .xml somewhere (You just need it for the next steps)\n3.2 Close Flash Image Tool after saving\n4. Flash Image Tool has now created an unpacked folder with your BIOS, replace the \"Me Region\" file with the clean ME Region you've downloaded from win-raid (Make sure the file name is identical!)\n5. Open Flash Image Tool again and load the config .xml (Make sure not to load the .ROM! Just the .xml), this will load the unpacked files with the now new and replaced ME Region\n6. Press Build Image\n7. In the Flash Image Tool folder will now be a new build folder containing a .ROM file that will precicely fit your macbook's SPI ROM. Flash it to the macbook\n8. Enjoy, make sure to run ASD after flashing to verify basic ME workings!\n\nNo idea if this is the best or easiest way but it has worked for me in the past"
