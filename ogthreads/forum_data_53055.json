            "message": "This was water damaged Macbook, keyboard took damage and a bit of the SMC area. Someone tried to repair it previously by making one jumper and reflowing ISL.\n\nUsing DCPS, the board tries to boot and pulls 1700mA, but drops shortly after to 24mA and stays there. I'm guessing SMC not working properly since there are some pads and traces corroded/broken which could make it not restarting right? See picture 2.\n\nThe last picture shows resistors R5171/72 in boardview placed North-South, but on my board, they're West-East. Which one is right?"
