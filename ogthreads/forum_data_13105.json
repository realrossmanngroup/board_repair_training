I've looked up the part ( I hope ) here [url]http://www.mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=sot891[/url] .... doesnt give me much help because first of all it's square and second I cant really clean off the bottom good enough to see the tiny variant on pad 1 to orient it.  The part has a number 2 on it and if any one can post a pic or tell me which way the number 2 faces. ..etc.   Also if I've fried it can someone please let me know if I've got the right part and which one it is on that webpage.  *FACEPALM"

I replaced this part from a working board and now the computer boots buts is soooo slow at everything.  The put it back on working board ( fyi this is just for practice ) and now working board has same issue.  I wonder if I got it too hot?  looks fine but can you tell me if the mouser part I posted is the correct one and actually which one I should use?  Thx I'm just learning and I don't see the exact amps on the schematics as whats given to me on that webpage."

I was running it off just the power supply (85w) without battery, just to practice my micro soldering skills transferring component without frying it etc.  So running with no battery can cause the slow down?

Hey I did what I planned on doing which was practice not pulling pads off and finding out how much heat these components can take.  I took it off and put it on about 5 times so lesson learned.  Just not that great with looking at the schematic and seeing what the differences are when buying the part from mouser.com.  Here is what I have found on mouser.com [url]http://www.mouser.com/Search/Refine.aspx?Keyword=74AUP1G3208[/url].  I'm just a little hesitant to pull the trigger.  \nI know it needs to be 74AUP, SOT891 (SIZE), what I'm unsure of is the 74AUP vs AUP on that page.  The only thing in stock is just AUP.  I'd really like to get my working board back up and running.  Thank you"
