Also there is slight ticking noise from the board, but cant pinpoint the location.\n\nTried with both disconnected trackpad only and cable from the board to KBD/Tpad.\n\nWhich voltages should I report?\nCoil voltage seems ok apart than these, which seem missing (or inaccurate?):\n\nPPVCC_CPU_PH1 - 0V\nPPVCC_CPU_PH2 - 0V\nPPVCC_CPU_PH3 - 0V\nVCCINAUX_SW - 1.81V"
