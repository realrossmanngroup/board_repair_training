Will do., Just curious though, the smc is on the complete opposite end of the board, why would you think liquid would have got there? there are no signs of liquid anywhere around it.

( i have never done it before and replacing it is not an option for me as I do not have the equipment)\nThe display connector got hit and there was a little liquid around the thunderbolt area(u2800).\nI have inspected the rest of the board and have not found any other signs of liquid."
