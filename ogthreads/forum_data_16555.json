            "message": "Now that Apple is no longer replaceing any of the 2011 boards that exhibit GPU problems what is the procedure to repair these? I have heard in the past that the GPU is not nessicarly the underlying factor to the reason these boards fail ( cause the system to crash or not boot) and report bad in Apple VST tests. I assume that the solution to this problem is something similar to the 2012 Retina model where a chip needs to be replaced or re-set in some way. Can anybody confirm this and possibly direct me to the chip in question that is causing these known issues?"
