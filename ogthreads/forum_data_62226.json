Replaced some of the components around it and also u7000 itself. I'm starting to realise that this u7000 might not be compatible with the 820-00850. Is that why it's only getting 5V through USB? 0amp. \nAlready replaced a couple of bad CD32s on it but no change."

These are not sold to anyone but Apple, so anything you find online either lacks firmware to make it work or is a pulled chip of unknown origin and hard to trust. Most reliable way to get one is to get your hands on a newer board that has this chip, or from a similar device that uses it (there used to be an iPhone 7 battery case you could buy for ~$70 and pull one from)"
