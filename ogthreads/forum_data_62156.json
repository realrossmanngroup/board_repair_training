After cleaning the corrosion it would seem that there are components missing. However, theres a circuit missing from boardview  (see picture)[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60341[/ATTACH]\n\nSince i dont have a donor board, i looked at pictures on the internet and it would seem it is missing a cap, can anyone confirm a cap goes there? Thanks"
