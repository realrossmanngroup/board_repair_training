Thought was easy only to restore in DFU and indeed worked.\nAfter testing everything looked good till I put the machine in standby, I see again the restore symbol on the screen.\n\nBasically I realised that I can use normal  the machine but as soon I turn it off or put it in stand by after closing the screen, the MacBook goes in a boot loop.\nPrecisely restarts by itself and shows the prohibition symbol and I cannot go in option menu, just keeps boot looping till I dfu restore it again.\n\nI did not work much on this board, but looks in mind condition inside. Any idea what could be wrong?"
