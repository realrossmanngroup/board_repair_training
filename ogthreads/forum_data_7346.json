            "message": "I have an 820-3437 board that had minor liquid damage. The board is working fine again except it's not recognizing any batteries. On the pullup resistors I'm getting 3.42V on the pin 1 side and 3.42V (with normal switching down) on pin 2 of R5380 but pin 2 of R5381 is peaking out at 2.4V with a slight pulse down. I switched it out with no change. Any ideas why it might be doing this?"
