            "message": "Hello. Got an 820-2936 here that got fried by knockoff charger. ISL6269 was fried, Q7030 and Q7035 also fried. SMC is fried like KFC. I replaced ISL, replaced both mosfets and verified all current sensing resistors near ISL. Also replaced D6990, U6990 and Q7080 as they looked suspicious. At the present moment I got SMC out of the board and am working on establishing at least 12.24V on PPBUS_G3H line. My readings are as follows:\n\nGot 16.5V from charger DCIN\nPPBUS_G3H varies from 0.3V to 2V after some time charger is connected, if I heat up Q7080 I get immediately 12.24V on L7030 and steady 3.3V on L6995. I'm stuck now. Tried injecting 12.5V on L7030, I get a sparkle but it does not drain any current from my PSU. Any ideas on what to look?"
