            "message": "I have a L-2011 820-2936 here that came in with a no charge issue. Battery tested faulty. Board will not power up fully on charger with battery connected (fan spin for 3 seconds then power off) Zero signs of liquid or corrosion on board. Will boot with battery AND charger connected, but will not charge battery. Pulls 10mA with machine powered off and good battery connected. Tried replacing U7000 with no luck. Any thoughts?"
