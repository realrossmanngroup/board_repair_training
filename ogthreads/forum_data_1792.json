            "message": "Hi,\n \nfor a long time, I had a faulty 820-1889-A Macbook, a fried donated to me. Today I decided to fix it. I knew, that it had a blown backlight fuse, but now the Macbook didn\u2019t turn on at all. So I took the logic board out of the Macbook. The Charger Light was green, but it sometimes disappeared but there was no fan spin.\n \nWell, I had a schematic for this board but no board view. So I decided to try the first obvious thing: testing the voltage of the backup / bios battery. I measured about 2.8V without Charger. After I plugged the charger in, the voltage dropped to 2.6V.\n \nSo the battery was bad, but I had no other by the hand. So I decided to use my Lab-Power Supply to put 3V on this \u201crail\u201d. So I took a crocodile clamp and put it on the Firewire port and connected it to the not grounded minus port of the power supply. The plus I connected to a small probe. The probe was just on the table, not on the board.\n \nI was setting the voltage on the power supply without turning the output on, in this moment I heard a strange sound. In the moment I looked to the board and saw, that the fan was spinning and just in this moment the magic smoke escaped from the NH82801GBM Hub.\n \nI don\u2019t understand, what went wrong and why I have blown the Hub. I\u2019ve just connected one wire of the power supply (not the cheap china power supplys, but a Rigol DP832A 800$ supply). Do you have any idea, what went wrong?"
