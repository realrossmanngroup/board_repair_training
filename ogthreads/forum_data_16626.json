I use maximum temp and airflow of 4 for normal use 2-3 for iphone and 9 for when stuff is pissing ma off, changing the temp requires holding a button for 5 seconds changing each number one at a time, nah fuck that, maximum temp, low enough air flow to not shoot things off the board, vary the actual power by adjusting distance angle and time"

Find what works for you by practicing on dead boards. Every board is different too, different boards absorb/dissipate different amounts of heat at different speeds."
