After a lot of work I made the board work again. It worked for 2 months and this week it came back again with no 20V on charger. All LDO voltages present and all LDO diode modes ok between all 4 chips, all reading close each other. PPBUS_G3H 12.27V indicating no communication with T2. Machine does not enter in DFU nor gets recognized on another computer."
