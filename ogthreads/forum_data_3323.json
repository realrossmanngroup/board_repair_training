            "message": "I got this 820-3435 that was a no backlight. The lcd cable was burned and there was water damage in the area. I replaced the connector and cable and now it boots up fine.\n\nWhen I boot up I get taken to the Reset Password page with the three options. I can move the cursor around with no problem but when I try to click it doesn't work. I've tried using the arrow keys on the keyboard to select an option as well as turning the computer off with the power button but that didn't work either. I hit the caps lock button on the keyboard and it didn't light up.\nWhen I click the trackpad the bottom of it has a weird click to it where it kind of pushes in like it is not screwed in even though I tried tightening the 6 screws on each side of the tpad.\nI plugged a brand new keyboard in and that one didn't work as well.\nI also plugged in an external wired logitech mouse and the lights flashed on the mouse but it didn't work.\n\nI do not have another trackpad or flex cable for this model to test but I can order one if needed.\n\nHere are voltage mode measurements I got of J4800 without the keyboard plugged in\n\npin1 3.4v\npin2 0v\npin3 0v\npin4 0v\npin5 0v\npin6 0v\npin7 0v\npin8 0v\npin9 0v\npin10 3.32v\npin11 3.32v\npin12 3.32v\npin13 3.3v\npin14 5.1v\npin15 0\npin16 3.32v\npin17 3.32v\npin17 3.41v\npin18 3.41v\npin19 3.43v\npin20 3.43v\n\nR4850/R4851/R4852/R4853 all measured the proper resistance but when I look in that area I see there are some probe points in the area that are slightly red."
