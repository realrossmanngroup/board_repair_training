            "message": "This board came in completely dead, no green light or anything. Made a visual inspection of the board, and oddly enough there where no sign og water damage at all.\nThe U7000 had a small crater on it so it got replaced. After replacing the U7000 I got green light and the fan started. Mounted the board back in the machine and found the machine running quite slow and not recognizing the battery. Tried with a well known battery, but still nothing. The BIL doesn't show anything when pressing the button either (tried two different ones as well).\nThe board does run on a charged battery but does not show up in OS. Ran ASD with noe errors.\n\nStarted measuring around the board:\n- Current sensing resistors R7050-52 seems fine\n- Q7055 Pin 5 is only 5-7V when battery is not connected\n- R5280 and R5281 both measures good, and is receiving 3,42V\n- The J6955 looks great\n\nWhile sitting here writing I just realized that I haven't checked D6950 or R6950 yet. I will do this ASAP.\n\nI do fear a bad SMC, but if anyone has any suggestion to other things I should check I would appreciate if you shared with me :)"

I do however have some boards with SMCs on them.\nI guess I will need to re flash the BIOS as well if I just replace the SMC? Do I need to re-ball the SMC or is it possible to do this only by adding solder to the pads?"
