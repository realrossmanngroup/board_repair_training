            "message": "Hello,\n\nI have a 820-01700 water damaged motherboard. Corrosion on U7230 and UA750 as well. PPBUS_G3H shorted to ground and found out U7230 sent the voltage to the CPU.\n\nI just want to make sure the CPU is indeed fried. I currently have 20 volts 0 amps on the charger (why 0?). I already replaced the MOSFETS and now PPBUS_G3H is no longer shorted to ground. Currently I have 0 volts on all coils with PPBUS_HS_CPU / GPU @ 12.6 volts. If CPU is fried, could vCore still exist?"

            "message": "Very likely CPU is dead now; result of overvoltage through its core power supply.\n\nDepending which CPU internal block was damaged, its core voltage can still appear.\nSome of its blocks and PCH are involved in core voltage generation.\n\nAt least you can compare resistance to ground on the coils (L7211/21/31) with good similar board."
