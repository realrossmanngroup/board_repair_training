            "message": "i got this machine after customer tried doing their own battery replacement. the isl had a hole through it and q7030 was shorted to ground along with q7055. replaced both and machine turns on but is too slow after it gets into OS also the mac runs on battery but wont see it or turn on without adapter plugged in. macbook will run without a hitch in recovery mode. when checking disc with first aid i get invalid flag warnings. ran system with external drive and still runs slow. i ran apple hardware diagnostics test and it came back with no errors. i included hardware monitor values if it may help.\n\nalso cpuvcore is 0.865v as opposed to the 1.25v on schematic if that matters."
