            "message": "Happy Easter fellows!\n\nCLient came with this 820-4924, backlight didnt work, sometimes it turned on and worked for a while and then off again. After checking the board found liquid U8330 and U5510. Cleaned it and replaced the IC, and I thought all be OK, but not! I still have no backlight. I do have 49v on the pin of the connector (that looks very clean). Tried a known working display from our own office computer (2015 too) and same issue happened. Tried his display in our office computer, same...... Replaced 2 different cables on his display as I know these always fail, same! This is kinda weird. Is there any other thing beside display - display cable and U8330 that can cause issues? The area around U7700 looks very clean, and it works as its sending 49v to the connector. Maybe change the display connector? Or change U7700? ALso no shorts on pin 1 PPVOUT."
