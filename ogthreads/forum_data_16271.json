I don't even know where to begin with it.\n\nIt turns on (fan spins), backlight comes on, it sometimes (if it's been off for a long time) gives the bios splash screen, then it turns off. Won't turn on until I disconnect the power for a little while and then it repeats.\n\nIt has no liquid damage and looks really clean and tidy.\n\n\nAny suggestions appreciated!"
