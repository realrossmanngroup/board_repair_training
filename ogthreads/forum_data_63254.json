Its repaired and the problem gone. \n\nDuring the debugging process of the  problem, accidentally (while trying to find the short) i  inverted the polarity of P3V42_G3H (2V only). \nNow the laptop is working and detecting the battery but is not charging the battery. It also turns off if i unplug the charger and won't boot without the charger. The battery is ok. \n\nI performed some measurements and i have:\n\n\nPP3V42_G3H is present on charger, but not on battery\n\nOn Battery only:\n\n\nPPBUS_G3H 1V\nPPDCIN_G3H_CHGR 3V\nCHGR_UGATE 1 V\nCHR_PHASE 0V"
