            "message": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have a slightly liquid damaged board which initially had no light but there was corrosion around U7501 so I replaced the the chip and also changed capacitors C7500 (one pad was completely destroyed so made a jumper going to Pin 23 of U7501) and C7503. No I have a green which now turns to orange light but still not powering on and nothing warms up either.\n[TABLE=\"border: 0, cellpadding: 0, cellspacing: 0\"]\n[TR]\n[TD=\"width: 220\"]PPBUS_G3H[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD=\"width: 147\"]12.56V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPDCIN_G3H[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]16.41V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V42_G3H[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]3.42V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PPVRTC_G3J[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]3.42V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S5[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]1.7001V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S4[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP5V_S0[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_S0[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_S3[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]0V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]PP3V3_S5[/TD]\n \t\t\t[TD]3.29V[/TD]\n \t\t[/TR]\n[/TABLE]\n\n\nI'm basically getting no 5V (besides 1.7 on S5) and no 3V3 RailsThese are some of my readings and I have checked all the rails but nothing else looks damaged and not sure where to go from here.\n\nMany thanks for any help.\nSam"
