Before I lift it up (haven't done it on such big chips) and reball it. Any recommendations or suggestions? \nDone this method on CD3215 and is a breeze - [MEDIA=youtube]hpYOgsVDzWQ[/MEDIA]\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"503px\"]60823[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"407px\"]60825[/ATTACH]\n\n\n\n\nAlso noticed these little dots on supposed to be 0ohm backlight VDD resistors. But they measure 100Ohm (without lifting them up). That should be OK, right?\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]60821[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"618px\"]60822[/ATTACH]"
