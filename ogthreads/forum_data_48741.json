            "message": "Got Pro Retina board that boots fine but will not recognize battery.\nHistory: was liquid damaged, completely dead, cleaned by someone, but that only brought it back to power on without charging/running off battery.\n\nISL current sensing circuits are good: 17/18 are .1ohm/2.3ohm; 27/28 are 10.1/10.4 ohms (no breaks in traces to ISL).\nReplaced ISL already.\n\nReflowed SMC because it looked like someone tried to reflow it already (poorly I might add).\n\nIt will now run off the battery, but is not detected in the OS. Tested known good battery and same thing.\n\nSDA and SCL lines test at .47~ in diode mode (red on ground, black on probe), and I know that it's supposed to be somewhere around .57/.59. Voltage is 3.4 but drops to 3.2-3.3 every second or so.\nReplaced D7050 in case that was bad, no go. I don't think the ISL is pulling it down. No broken traces under microscope (from R5380 and R5381 to SMC).\n\nCan I get a consensus that it's probably the SMC? Or am I missing something pretty obvious? I don't think it's crap under the battery connector, but it very well could be?"
