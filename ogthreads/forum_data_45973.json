If you let it sit for a while, it will turn on again, and then not turn on after you shut it down. Any idea what could cause something like this? I attached pre-ultrasonic cleaning pictures."

I did notice though that the SDA and SCL battery lines were not measuring correctly (there was a big difference in diode mode) so I replaced U7100.
