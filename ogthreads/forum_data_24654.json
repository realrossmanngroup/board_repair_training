            "message": "2013 15\" macbook pro \"a\", \"1\", \"delete\" key randomly not working\n\nSo i have not been on in a while so i do not know if this got covered. Laptop randomly does not let the three keys work A,1,DELETE. Then they magically start working again. Sometimes it seems to be tied to the sleep function. Other times it does not. Happens frequently. Trying to diagnose if just a bad keyboard or something else. Anyone have any ideas where to start?"
