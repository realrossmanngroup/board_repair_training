            "message": "This board came in with some liquid spil near the Type C ports. Short to ground on R3350. Found a broken line under D3309 and after fixing that short is gone. Also replaced U3100 for a new one as this one showed a slightly higher temp in Flircam then the one besides it. U7000 also was hot, replaced that for a new one. Now nothing on the board gets hot but still, 5.18v on the charger and 0.02A. No short one the below lines:\n\nPP3v3_G3H = 3.41\nPPBUS_G3H = drops from 5V to 0 slowly\nPPDCIN_G3H = 5.21v\n\nAny ideas?"

I have following measurements:\n\nF3000 & F3010 = 5.21v, should this not be 20v?\nU2890 had some dirt around it so i replaced it, but no 20v yet\n\nEdit: the CD3215C's i used i bought from China. I just read somewhere, these IC are programmed? Im not sure if these IC are new, they look like they have been reballed. Just to make sure, will use the CD3215s from a donor board instead and try that."
