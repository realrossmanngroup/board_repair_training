Autostarts every time you plug it in.\n\nNot sure what to do with this one. 820-3462 Replaced R6920, C6900-02 and C6994 to get power flowing back in from the MagSafe. The computer is fully assembled with battery attached but it still autostarts every time you plug it in, like there's no battery attached. Any ideas what might cause something like this? I attached some pre-ultrasonic pictures."
