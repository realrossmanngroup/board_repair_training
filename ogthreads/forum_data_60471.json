            "message": "Hello, long time no post.\n\nI have a 820-00850 board which has no power, USB provides approximately 5.2v on all ports and 0.05 / 0,06 amps.\n\nWe have got\nPPBUS_G3H 12.3v\n\nHave not got\nPP5V_G3S\n\nI'm unfamiliar with exactly how this model works, aside from a few of louis' videos.\n\nLooking at the board I saw corrosion under Q3440 which was missing pin 3 on the chip side so will need to be replaced.  Is this enough to stop the laptop from booting?\n\nThe rest of the board looks OK. Is it worth reflowing the U3100 chip on that part of the board?"
