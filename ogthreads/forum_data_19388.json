I don't have the schematic but pretty sure if you look pp3v42 power supply circuit you will find a dual switching mode diode. But if you fixed green light, it s not anymore relevant.\n\nIf intermittent green light is fixed, and you are using 85w charger and you short SMC_ONOFF_L pads or use a keyboard to power on the board and it still doesn't power on, then it's time to check further power rails.\n\nWhat about C7771 output voltage?"
