            "message": "Hello everyone,\n\nI just had an interesting breakdown (820-00239)\nThe 4 CD3215C00's burned out, all had a burn hole on them.\nI changed the 4, one side worked ( loop on 5v ) the other side was blocked at 5v. On the side that didn't work, no LDO 1v1.\n\nAfter several tests, I changed the TBT ROM chip on the side that was blocking, and miraculously, everything worked.\n\nSo I asked myself: is it possible that the program in the ROMs on each side of the controllers are programmed to tell if there are 4x CD32 or 2X or 1X on the board? And so, by copying the program from a model with only 2x CD32,\nwould it be possible to disable one side on a model with 4x CD32? Has anyone tried this idea yet?"
