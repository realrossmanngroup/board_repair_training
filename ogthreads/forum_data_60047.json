            "message": "First time post here - I'm relatively new at board repair in general.\n\nAs the title says, I've got an 820-3437-B that won't power on.  I get an orange light on the charger and no fan spin.\n\nWith a visual inspection, I found corrosion on U1900 and components in close proximity.\n\nI have tried quite a few things, but since I'm not even sure that I could remember all of the things I've tried so far, I'm going to just list out where things stand currently, things that I know of at least.\n\nVoltage readings:\n(In no certain order)\nPPBUS_G3H - 8.57V\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.42V\nPP5V_S4RS3 at L7520 - 0.89V\nPP3V3_S5 at R5590 Pin 1 - 3.34V\nL7310 - 0V\n\nVoltage readings around U1900:\nPPVRTC_G3H - C1910 - 3.41V\nPP3V3_S3 - R2040 - 3.33V\nPP3V3_S0 - R2041 - 1.78V\n\nOther possibly related voltage readings:\n\nPM_SLP_S4_L - R8179 - 0.80V\nS4_PWR_EN - R8177 - 0.00V\nP5VS4RS3_EN - R8176 - 0.80V\nPM_SLP_S5_L - R8115 - 0.00V\nSMC_S4_WAKESRC_EN - U8170 - 0.00V\n\n\n\nAlso, in case it's relevant, the CPU gets hot.  I've tested and tried a lot of different things, but since I am new at this, please don't assume that I haven't overlooked something.\nAny help and advice will be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n*Edit** Reading over this again, this looks like a total plz bro type of post which wasn't my intention.  I have looked up, or at least attempted to figure out, where the missing/low lines originate and how the different rails get created.  My brain is just complete mush right now from working on this for at least 6-7 hours so far."

I then went to the other nearby and possibly related/relevant mosfet's and did the same, and near U8030, PP3V3_S0_FET_R gave a very low diode mode reading, somewhere around .040, and PP3V3_S5 was .025.  So I removed U8030 and PP3V3_S0_FET_R now reads 0.366, but PP3V3_S5 still reads .025.   I still didn't remove U8010 yet until I told you what I found with this, to see if you wanted me to go ahead and remove it for sure."
