I replaced all corroded components I could find, including both CD3215s. Now I'm left with PP5V_G3S which shows 80-100 \u03a9 to ground (0.07 in reverse diode mode). No shorts on any other rail I could find.\n\nI already lifted every chip powered by PP5V_G3S but haven't found the culprit for the short. I can't inject 5V into 100 \u03a9 (not enough current flow). How can I find the short?"
