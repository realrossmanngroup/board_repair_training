            "message": "Hello. Got this board here with VCORE stuck at 1.72V and not chiming. I thought it might be BIOS related so I flashed a new clean file, but still no luck, same results. I'm inspecting the board to see if I can find any obvious hints like corrosion or etc. Board has a few little green stuff but nothing major. No apparently bad solder joints or rotten components. For what I understand 1.7V VCORE means the board is missing some kind of communication between CPU and BIOS right? What should I look?"
