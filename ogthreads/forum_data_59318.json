I guess she is right but absolutely no corrosion on the board whatsoever.\nIt has green/orange light and the pp3v42 is actually 3.32v (bit low?) and the ppbus is 4.2v and the only thing getting a bit warm (not hot) is the cpu.\nThe area around U7100 looks as the rest of the board like new , unfortunately absolutely no corrosion anywhere .\nThe board is taking 350 mA ....\nAny tips where to turn :)\n\nThank you all for any tips"

The board now takes 0.073V\nAnd YES the U1900 does get hot !!!!\nVoltage on pin 1 is 0.226V and diode mode beeeeeeps\n\nresistance 17/18 is 3.6 Ohm\nresistance 27/28 is 20.9 Ohm\n\nISL6259 voltages\npin 1 = 3.5V\npin 2 = 17.61V\npin 3 = 0 V\npin 9 = 0.031 V\npin 12 = 3.34 V\npin 13 = 3.29 V\npin 15 = 0.046 V\npin 19 = 5.506 V\npin 20 = 5.506 V\npin 27 = 0.001 V\n\nit seems like R7020 gets a bit warm as well on my Flir , but the precision is not the best on it (its the one attachable to the phone) so it could be something around it.\n\nThanks again for your answer"
