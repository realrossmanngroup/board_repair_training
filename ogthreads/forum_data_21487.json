            "message": "After cleaning this board no backlight, after some digging around decided to replace the U9701 backlight driver. On plugging in the charger i get 50V on the backlight driver, but this drops down to ~20V after a split second. Without a screen plugged in i get 0 volts on the drive line. I've tried with a known good lcd. Am i just bad at soldering, or could there be something else going on?"

            "message": "It's taken a while for me to get back to this one, there's a lot of weird stuff happening with this machine.\nPPBUS_S0_LCDBKLT measures a steady 8.05 V without a screen, but as soon as i connect a screen it drops to about 4.8 V\n\ni checked for presence of BLK_EN, it seems that the signal is coming through to R9731, but it stops there. Resistance on this measures in the high Mohms. I replaced the resistor, and also U9701, just in case. Resistances seem back to normal, but after i turn on the machine, with a screen connected, BKL_EN does not reach U9701. after disconnect it turns out the resistor is burned out again.\n\nAlso BKL_PWM measures 0.45 V at U9701 with a screen connected.\n\nIt seems to me there could be trace damage under the U9701 area that is causing this, but i'm a little at a loss since i've never seen this before. Is there something i can still try?\n\nedit: how do i see if the connector is burned up?"

I know this is unlikely, but it does seem to be what is happening. I've seen the sticky about these backlight circuits, and i will redo the entire thing soonish and come back to this again to let you know if i'm making some stupid mistake with this."
