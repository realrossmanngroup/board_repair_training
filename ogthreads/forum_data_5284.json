            "message": "Hey Guys, I got a 820-2936 that came in with no power and no water damage history. When I connect the charger to the macbook it flashes green and orange very rapidly. I checked the main power rails and got the following readings PPBUS_G3H 0.45v, PPDCIN_G3H 17.06v, PP3V42_G3H 0.02v. I did some inspection around U7000 and notice that im receiving 3.44v at CHGR_ACIN but I'm missing all the output voltages CHGR_AMON 0.004v, CHGR_BMON 0.003v, SMC_BC_ACOK 0v.  My instinct tells me that u7000 is dead. Can this be the case? Should i check voltages anywhere else? This circuit always confuses me -___-\n\nThanks,"
