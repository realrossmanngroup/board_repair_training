            "message": "Hi All,\n\nlet me start with introducing myself, I'm an electronics engineer working in software now for ASML. I started repairing macbooks (actually Louis videos triggered me ;-) ) from a hobby perspective now and then but it has grown since to 1 or 2 a week. My repair side carrier made it possible to invest in proper tooling (trinocular microscoop, JBC soldering, Quick hotair, HP multimeter, power supply with dual 30v5A, i5 hackintosh workstation from Aliexpress :-D\n\n\nI'm working on a case (read rabbit-hole) for data recovery of an A1708 board 820-00840, i'll try to be as elaborate as possible (most from memory)\n\nwhen I received the board it was doing absolutely nothing. I took some pictures of the corrosion and ultrasonically cleaned the board. this revealed some problem areas.\na lot of PP3V3_GH circuit was broken/gone, replaced some resistors and removed some caps. It works now (doesn't look very nice since i only had 0603 resistors laying around)\n\n[ATTACH type=\"full\"]59347[/ATTACH][ATTACH type=\"full\"]59348[/ATTACH]\nthe gone pads are TPAD testpoints/via's, didn't bother fixing those yet\n\nPP3V3_GH, repaired the circuit and now 3,4v present (when powered via F7000)\nstill no power via USB-C (stays at 5v 0mA, other port 5v 50mA and getting hot)\nfirst replaced one CD3215 (the one getting hot) , still not equal mA, replaced second CD3215, now both equal. PPDCIN_3GH present at Q7030 (usb 5v 10mA)\nI did not trust the U7000 (ISL) (weird impedance at Aux_det) so replaced it\nnow Aux det is 1,2v and R7015, R7016 measure ok.\nnow I get 5v at charger and 40mA cycling at both USB ports, but ISL still creates no PPBUS (12v3)\n\nwhen I supply power to the battery terminal, (7v5) it takes 15mA and I measure this voltage also at F7000 (tried 10v, no change), PPBUS is than equal to the supplied voltage\n\nSMS_RESET_R_L = 3,4v at R7072\nPM_EN_P3V3_GH = 5v at R6999\nSMC_AUX_OK = 3,4v at R7071\nPP3V3_3GH_UPC = 3v3 at C3100 and C3200\n\nAny clues where to look further?"

What would be a trustworthy source (available in EU) for the cd3215.\n\nI'll have a look into the signals mentioned and get back to it"
