            "message": "Prior to putting in DFU this board had liquid damage to LCD backlight area. That was solved and I could see cycling of power rails. I could see .8V on CPU rails cycling power briefly. So I thought maybe T2 issue. Was able to get it in DFU mode and have tried restoring the T2. It gets to 4th step then fans come on high and i get this error: \n\nThe operation couldn\u2019t be completed. (AMRestoreErrorDomain error 9 - Failed to receive message from device, might be connection problem with USB host. (Communication error, possibly USB disconnection)) [AMRestoreErrorDomain \u2013 0x9 (9)]\n\nNow it seems to be stuck in DFU all of the time. Now when i plug it to power it stops at 20.4V and 0 amps.  Prior it would cycle the wattage and amps but wouldn't boot. I'm not seeing any signs of more issues on the board."
