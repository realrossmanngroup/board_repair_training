It will turn on automatically every-time when i plug the magsafe.\n\ni know 2013,2014 air, turns on automatically without a battery connected and only once when connected with a battery.\n\nbut this has known good fully charged battery and it still turns on automatically. i've tired without trackpad flex and it still does it.\n\nplease watch my video, [URL]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdRwDpt6Y-0[/URL]"
