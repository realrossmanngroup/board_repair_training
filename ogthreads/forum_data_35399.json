            "message": "Hello,\n\nCan an A1502 SMC be used to replace a A1398 SMC? I've just replace two different A1398 board ([URL=\"tel:820-3662\"]820-3662[/URL], [URL=\"tel:820-3738\"]820-3738[/URL]) smc due to no power, with ones taken from a A1502 boards. Now both A1398 boards right fans aren't working. I've confirmed the below voltages are present.\n\nPP5V_S0\nPP3V3_S0\n\nSMC_FAN_1_CTL voltage is at 0.0034V and not increasing.\n\nAlso performed resistance check and compared to the left side, both match. \n\nI swapped out the smc twice on one of the board with the same results (confirmed pads for fan control was good). \n\nHas anyone experienced this and what what did you find was the issue?\n\nThanks."
