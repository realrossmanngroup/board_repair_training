            "message": "Repairing this board for a friend, but looking more and more like a bad PCH. I want to make absolutely sure before giving him the bad news.\n\nBoard had liquid all over, 7+ areas. Replaced obviously bad components. PP3v42_G3H was shorted; found U7941 was shorted, replaced, and short on 3v42 was gone. Got green light. Fixed some burned traces in a few areas, and ppbus was very low. Replaced ISL, got solid 12.58v on ppbus. Now all S5 rails present (including S5_PWRGD), but PM_SLP_S5_L is not present. VRTC is present everywhere it should be, and PM_SLP_SUS_L is also present. Resistance to ground on L7630 is 7.6ohm.\n\nIs there anything else I can check before declaring this board irreparable (I can't replace PCHs)? Thanks for any help."
