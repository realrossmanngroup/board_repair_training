            "message": "i have 820-4924-a water damage has green light but doesn't turn on. I started measuring around and i'm missing PM_SLP_S4_L so i watched on one of louis videos with similar problem so when this signal took me to the PCH i checked for the voltage that powers the PSH  -- PM_PCH_PWROK and that took me to U1950, and there i have voltage on pin 8 (PP3V42_G3H_CSPWRGD) and pin 2 (CPUVR_PGOOD_R) and the important signal im missing is pin 1 (ALL_SYS_PWRGD) so i tried to find where this signal comes from and that took me U8160 and that component doesn't exist on the board just empty pads. This shit is confusing. Any ideas ?"
