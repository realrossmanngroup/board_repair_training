            "message": "13 inch macbook pro 820 3115 just had a new hard drive and all good.\nBeen brought back in with screen flicker. It has been worked out that then tapping the top left of the housing by the esc key the screen flickers and the computer stops responding. Restarting it fixes the issue. Tilting the screen doesn't have any effect.\nHas anyone seen this before? Is it an lcd problem or board problem? Maybe then lcd cable?\nThanks"
