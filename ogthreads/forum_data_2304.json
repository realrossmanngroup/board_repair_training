            "message": "So I have a 15\" retina, finally something worth fixing. However, has been eaten alive by coke I guess.\n\nWell, decimated the thunderbolt circuit and charger circuit. The Diode D7105 has only pin 3 pad left, but 1 and 2 are gone. I want to focus on these two first.\n\nI am trying to figure out the best way to connect pins i and 2 on the diode. (need some advise here) Is there a way to connect them without running a trace to the resitor on the other side of the board? Can i attach them both to the probe point #528 and soldier the two legs on the diode together?\n\nI will be replacing all the components on the charger dc in circuit, i have it all prepped and ready to be replaced, the traces seem intact. (so far)\n\nThe rest of the board seems visually fine, but when the charger gets plugged in it sparks, so i am sure this is just the beginning .\nI have attached a photo of the schematic page where the damaged occurred  [ATTACH]2306._xfImport[/ATTACH] [ATTACH]2307._xfImport[/ATTACH]"
