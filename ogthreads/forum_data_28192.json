There was corrosion present under the SMC, so I have done a reflow on it as well. No more 4924 donors to replace it. Here are measurements.\n\nPPBUS - 12.58V\nPP3v42 - 3.428V\nPPVRTC - 3.336V\nPPVIN_S5_HS_Computing - 12.58V\nPP18vDCIN - 16.6V\nPP5V_S5 - 5.02V\nPP5V_S3 - 0V\nPP3v3_s5 - 3.35V\npp3v3_3 - 0V\nSMC_RESET_L - 3.396V (Charger turns green then back to amber when I measure this)\nSMC_ONOFF_L - 3.412V\n\nThank you."

Im not sure if it would have booted before swapping the SMC with a Chinese charger... I didn't think to try. Also no video at all. 0 volts going to LCD. Thanks man."
