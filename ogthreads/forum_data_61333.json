            "message": "Hi there\n\nI have in my posession a 2012 MacBook Pro A1286 (Board 820-3330-B) that has been randomly shutting off while on power and on battery. The battery has been replaced. I have gone through and all the power lines seem good. The only anomaly is that the charger is pulling 18.5V @ 380ma while the machine is powered off and takes approx 12 hours to charge a battery fully. This is a new battery. What could be causing this slow charge?"
