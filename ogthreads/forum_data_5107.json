            "message": "Hey all,\n\nHave a MBPRO 15\" with no backlight. No liquid damage, supposedly just stopped working.\n\nWhat' I've measured:\n\nFuse: 12.6v on each side\nBKLT_EN: 3.2v\nLVDS Pins 389,39,40; all at 29.6v\n\nFigured it was a bad LCD right? Nope, tested an LCD that works fine and no backlight still.\n\nThe current sink resistors all measure 0 ohms, getting between 3.2 and 3.5v on them. I figure the LED Driver is boosting fine since I'm getting 29v at the LCD connector.\n\nBad LVDS connector maybe?"

It's up to you at this point. If you feel your skills are up to it you can replace it, but if they aren't you killed a board that came to you with no backlight. Selling [I]that [/I]to the customer is far more difficult than \"we can only give you max brightness all the time.\"\n\nThe best would be if something but U9600 is causing the light to always be low, you replace it and it still doesn't work.. that would suck. :)"

Even if it was a reflow I still would prefer full brightness. You guys are great! Btw I got the idea and hard wired the PWM signal from another forum where Louis posted that solution. You're a lifesaver!"
