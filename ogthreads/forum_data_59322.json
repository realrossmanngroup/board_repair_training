            "message": "So i've received an 820-2850-A in today with what the customer tells me was kernel panics related to GPU.\nKnowing this is usually a C9560 issue I have dutifully removed C9560 and replaced it with the bigger 330uf tantalum capacitor as I normally do for these jobs. Now upon testing the board powers up but then shuts off again after around 5-10 seconds. Have tried a different capacitor and even replaced the old one to see if any difference but nothing. Getting 1.3v on pin 1 of C9560 whilst the fan is spinning.\n\nAny suggestion on what could be wrong?\n\nI've tried to remove the ram and the system does beep to indicate the ram isn't present!"

            "message": "Didn't use hot air no just the iron (Ersa I-con 1 Set to 400C), stays on without the RAM and just beeps then fans ramp up to full speed. Will try SMC bypass mode tomorrow.\nAlso the voltage on C9560 is 1.35v steady not 1.3v as I wrote earlier which from experience is normal.\n\nI'm wondering if it's worth popping the coil off and wiring my PSU directly to the power rail for this and setting it to run at 1.8v and see if it starts then and I get a picture or not any thoughts? I did try and inject some power into pin 1 of C9560 earlier at 1.2v and I did get a 0.3a current draw - would that be normal on this board? I don't have another to experiment with at present!"

            "message": "Thanks for that good future reference material! \nLooks fairly similar to the process on the 820-2915 boards. \n\nAlthough I can now mark this case as solved as it appears I was the victim of not checking the whole board very thoroughly under the microscope first. Whilst I did extensively check around C9560 incase I had damaged something during replacement it didnt occur to me to check everywhere else!\n\nIt seems the real fault was that L2550 which appears to be an S0 power supply for the PCH from looking at the schematic was ripped off this board - very unusual given the placement of L2550 and I struggle to believe it had anything to do with what I did. Having replaced it with one from a donor board the board now powers up and boots normally. \n\nSo my advice to anyone reading this in the future is to check carefully the whole board for any damaged components first!"
