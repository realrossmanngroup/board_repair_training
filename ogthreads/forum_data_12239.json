            "message": "Hi,\n\nI received this 820-3476. They said it was liquid damaged and they cleaned it.\nI found rice in the machine. I can't see any corrosion. They cleaned it very well.\nWell, they said it powered on and there was nothing on the screen.\nAfter they tried it to power on few times it started to beeping.\n\nI don't know what's true or what's not, but here it just cycles on and off.\nFan spins up stays on for 1-2 sec and then turns off and on again.\n\nI ultrasonic cleaned the board.\nActually there is no visible corrosion on the board except LVDS connector which I already removed.\n\nThere is CPU Vcore which is 1.68V.\nI checked all the Pins on the SPI rom. I can see there is communication on Pin 1,2,3,5,6 and there is 3.3V on Pin 7 and 8.\n\nY1905 oscillates when the board cycles on. There is 1V on the other side of Y1905.\n\nU1900 I've 3.4V on Pin 1 and I've the right clock signal on Pin 12.\n\nU1950 looks fine.\n\nCould this be a ROM problem?\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit:\n\nChecked U7100 area too.\n\nPin 17/18 4 Ohm\nPin 27/28 21.8 Ohm"

Well, I'll check those resistors in the SPI lines.\nI'll try to heat up the SMC and if it it still does not work it will be good for parts."
