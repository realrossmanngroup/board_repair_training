The computer works fine until you plug a battery in. After that the MagSafe light either stays orange or doesn't come on and the computer won't turn on. Any ideas? I'm not sure what would cause this."

This is what it was doing before I replaced U5110.\n\nAs I'm writing this I tested 3V42 and the board turned on and works again without battery.\n\nWith it working, PPBUS is 8.59V without battery, so that's normal. 3.3 ohms between pins 17 and 18. 20.1 ohms between 27 and 28.\n\nWith power adapter-only: CHGR_AMON is at .158V and BMON is at 1.1V and then goes up to 8.59 if I keep the probe on it for a few seconds.\nWith power adapter and battery plugged in: CHGR_AMON is at .61V and BMON is at .85V.
