            "message": "Hi guys i managed to get one of these in my store water damaged. Of course upon inspection the water damage was near and around the U7650 which is our same as older models tps chip. Checking around  that area i noticed that 5vs5 is missing so i checked for shorts none are present. I checked for my pp5vXX_en this signal is missing, which comes from PM_EN_P5VS5. This signal comes from U7890 that seems to be a logic gate, so on the U7890 i'm missing PMIC_EN_P3V3S5 that comes from U7800 the aka PMIC chip which is a bga. So my question is this shit has many input signals. is it possible that something else is not allowing this chip to output the 3v3s5 signal? I'm totally lost on this crap."
