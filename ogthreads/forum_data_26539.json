No power to the machine though.\n\nI checked PPBUS_G3H and get 0.686V at F7140\n\nAlso get:\nPP3V42_G3H at C4850: 3.43v\nPPVRTC_G3H at C1910: 3.43v\nPP5V_S5 at C7505: 0.622v\n\nThen I got to C7900 and C7901 which are both hot, sizzling hot, alcohol goes poof right away.\n\nSecond time I run into components getting this hot and it stops me as I don't want to do any/more damage. Any thoughts on where to go from here?"
