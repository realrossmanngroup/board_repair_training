Replaced resistor and also retraced a new line from RB631 pin2 to RB651pin2 as it's pad was missing. Also replaced QB631 due to signs of corrosion. Still won't power up. \nFound L6900/01 missing. Replaced. Still won't power up.\nTook below measurements\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.2\nPPDCIN_G3H - 5.17\nPP3V3_G3H - 3.4\nPP20V_USBC - 5.17\n\nSo replaced all the CD3215C chips with exact chips numbers. Still have the same result. Any other suggestions or is this dead board?"
