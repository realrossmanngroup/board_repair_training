Looks like the T2 is trying to read those chips for a while.\nThen it just quits reading and shuts down to 0.01A current draw.    Looks like a load failed.\n\nThermal imaging does not indicate any shorts or other activity.\n\nThere are no shorts to be found anywhere on the LB. (that I could find).\nBoard is free of H2O and physically looks perfect. \n\nLooking for a little guidance on this one."
