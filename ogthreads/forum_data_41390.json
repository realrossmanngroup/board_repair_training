            "message": "Hi, I have a liquid damaged 820-0138 with hi fans. The damage is minor and directly was found on R5381. G3_Poweron_L pad was burnt off the board as well. i have so far ran a wire from G3_Poweron_L to its test point next to R5172. SMBUS_SMC_5_G3_SCL is fluctuating from 3.42 - 3.20V. Replaced R5381 and reballed the original SMC and ISL. Diode mode on SMBUS is .510 and Diode on G3_Poweron_L is .728. Fans are still high with no other signs of liquid. Should I try another SMC? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!"
