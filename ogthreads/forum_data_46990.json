Replaced them and now have 2.588kohm on PP3V3R3V0_AON. \n\nReplaced ISL and had PP3V3R3V0_AON, but now its gone and I dont have anything on PPDCIN anymore either. \n\n\nPPDCIN - 28.51 kohm.\n\nThe only original charger I have is an 87 W USB C, so I have been using a couple adapters from 60 w Magsafe 2. \n\n\nThanks."
