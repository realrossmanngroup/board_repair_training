I dont have for now usb-c to hdmi so can check if external display is working. \n\n\nChecked EDP area and EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is missing and than PANEL_P5V_EN and PANEL_P3V3_EN are 0 too. All tests are done with good  lcd conected. \n\n\nI see that EDP_PANEL_PWR_EN is coming from CPU. \n\n\nAny suggestion ?"
