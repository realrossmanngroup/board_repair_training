            "message": "- I cleaned the board, there where some small areas where you could see a bit of liquid damage. After cleaning it looks ok.\n\n- Light from power adapter is  green\n\n- Checked the following power rails:\n\nPPBUS_G3H: 8.4V\nPPVIN_S5_CPU_IMVP_ISNS: 8.4V\nPP18V5_DCIN_CONN: 17.1V\nPP3V42_G3H_REG: 3.4V\n\nPP5V_S3_REG: 0V\nPP5V_S0_REG: 0V\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU_REG: 0V\n\nPP3V3_S5_REG: 3.3V\nPP3V3_S3_FET: 0V\n\nTried to get to the source why PP5V_S3_REG is 0V.\n- Checked [FONT=Courier]U7201(TPS51[/FONT]220)[FONT=Courier][SIZE=2] enable:[/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Courier][SIZE=2] - EN1: 0V[/SIZE][/FONT]\n[FONT=Courier][SIZE=2] - EN2: 3.4V[/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Courier][SIZE=2]Followed EN1 / [/SIZE][/FONT]P5VS3_EN which is same as PM_SLP_S4_L (double checked voltage also 0), which ends in U1400 (MCP79).\n\nMy only idea left is that the C7812 could be broken and pulls PM_SLP_S4_L to ground. But C7812 looks like it is not put on the board (there was a No Stuff comment on the diagram).\n\nFollowed source where PP3V3_S3_FET is supposed to come from. Ended up at Q7910. Source of the MOSFET is PP3V3_S3_P3V3S3FET, which I measured 3.3V. P3V3S3_SS is around 3.15V, which if I understand it correctly explains that the MOSFET switches PP3V3_S3_FET off. Then I tried to figure out why P3V3S3_SS is 3.15V. This is due to P3V3S3_EN is 0V.\nP3V3S3_EN is PM_SLP_S4_L and so the reason is the same as above.\n\nNow I'm stuck as I cannot tell why PM_SLP_S4_L is 0V. If anybody has some ideas what to do, I would greatly appreciate it."

However I just connected the board with the power supply, but did not manually power on the board with the pads.\nI just tried to do that now, but that did not change anything.  PP5V_S3_REG,  PP3V3_S3_FET and PM_SLP_S4_L are still 0V.\nIs there a way to verify that I have powered on the board correctly? I just connected the two 'PWR BTN' pads for a couple of seconds."
