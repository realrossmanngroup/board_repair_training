Or are they built into the surface of each component (i.e. not separate physical 'stickers')? I'm genuinely asking, I've only seen 12\" retina units and no new MBP touch-bard units yet. I'm really curious. Clearly some cleanup would be required, but if there's actually zero corrosion or staining on the board, swapping out the liquid-indicators just for Apple warranty coverage should not be an issue. Unethical, sure (but I mean, let's not even bring up ethics with regards to Apple), but that's not the question here, etc.\n\nedit: Not to derail thread at all; mod please delete if too off-topic."
