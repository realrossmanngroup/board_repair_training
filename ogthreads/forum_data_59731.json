            "message": "Hi I received a board with liquid damage in 2 areas \n\n1st Area:\nu7400 in area CPUIMVP_TONB (R7403,C7441) AND CPUIMVP_ISNS1_P (R7406,R7466) the resistors #\u2019s are just to pin point area of corrosion \n\n2nd area:\nQ5300 and R5314\n\nI get a green light and quickly the light goes out in a split second.\n\nI tested the \nPPBUS_G3H 320 Kohms\nPP3V42_G3H 1.79 Mohms\n\nLastly, I have another board here that chimes just has audio port issue. shouldn\u2019t a 2011 A1286 screen fit this model?  The lvds connector is silver ipex not gold ? Should I assume it\u2019s 1680 x 1050? Or the standard resolution? It won\u2019t go in so I\u2019m assuming no. but I could\u2019ve sworn I\u2019ve tested another 820-3330 in my test enclosure in the past. Anyway thanks in advance"
