            "message": "820-00164 customers board, liquid damaged. was a dead board the customer said they were getting there data off after the spill and it died on them in the process. brought back the green and orange light but no fan spin. looked into it and am missing pm_slp_s4_L. I check continuity between the R6110 R6120 R6125 to Probe 738 and all is connected and all have 3.3v. Could this be from the smc? the smc from the beginning looked like it had crap near/under it. also i am missing pp3v3_s4 and s3. any help is appreciated because i seem to have gotten my self stuck and not sure exactly what i should be testing from here."
