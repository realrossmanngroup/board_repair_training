            "message": "Hi everyone.\nMy first question is, whether it is normal for macbook pro 820-3115 to turn on by it self when plug in charger while device is off. I am asking because I saw one of louis's videos where he said some macbook air would do that... \n\nI have a customer macbook 820-3115 that came as \"not charging\"\n\nI checked port, tried charger. No light at all. Well I was suspecting water damage despite customer's claims \"no way\"... well I opened and found no damage. Then took apart and work on something else for couple days.\n\nAfter 2 days When I started working on it, it appeared to be in fully functional order. \n\nSince I had it apart a assumed ok, maybe one of the flexes coming short and turns on devices with inflow of power. \n\nHowever it wasn't the case. I attached all the flexes and assembled the macbook to try to replicate issue, however no success. It works as should be. \n\nOne thing bother me is the fact that fan starts spinning and devices start turning on as soon as I attach power source. I tired both ways, fully assembled and board only. \n\nIt turns despite the fact that lid is closed, I can tell that LCD is on, that's why I think it is not normal.\n\nI tried to reset PRAM. It made no difference. \nother things:\nbattery was 0% when i turned it on for the first time, so sth must have drain in... \nNow It charges normal 35% in about 40 min.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is 12v, which much lower than it should be, thats why I checked other power rails just in case, they are obviously fine. \n\nSince I didn't find much information on particular issue I was hopping it is something simple that no one bother posting, perhaps it is normal?"

I was staying on user choice and shut it down from there.\nAfter reading your message I realized that, so I logged in and shut it down, now it works, and doesnt turn on by itself.\nThank you!\nwell it still doesn't explain initial issue of mac no charging when customer brought it in... not sure what I soppuse to tell him what was the issue. but that is convesation for another forum."
