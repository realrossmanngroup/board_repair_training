So it looks like a short to ground on PP3v3_S5 and the USB-C controller might just be saving me from a fried CPU.  Pulled R7691 and L7690 to isolate the voltage regulator.  Despite U7650 looking like its had a blow torch on it the short is down circuit somewhere.  Let the hunt being"

Louis posted back in 2018 that almost all P3V3_S5 shorts on the new platforms have been CPU shorts.  I swear it wasn't there when i started on this .. ahh well one for the parts bin"
