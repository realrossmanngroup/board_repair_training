(inside registance lowering the voltage 39 to 19v).. that mean from chip side no ground output..... or load  39v , im not too good with writing ...i think you understand the point ....\n\n\nso after reflowing my chip its work like chump!!!!  \n\nand i think duke is superb! real good  engineer ......\n\nthank you all for help"
