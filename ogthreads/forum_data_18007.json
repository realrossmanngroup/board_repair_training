            "message": "temp varies too much from station to station and board to board. Just practice on a dead one and preheat the area a little from further away before you work on it with high temp. 375-450c is where I am most of the time. You can preheat from further away all you want, it's the time you spend close in at high temps that does damage, so minimize that by preheating the board a little. Testing components is covered in almost video as it is the basics required before anything else can be done."
