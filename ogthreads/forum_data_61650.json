            "message": "I recently bought this 2012 MBP 15\" 820-3330-b that had the no wifi hardware detected error. \n\nI replaced Q3550 and L3504 but my readings remain similar on all the pieces next to the wifi connector. On Q3550 I know pin 3 (P3V3WLAN_SS) should be reading higher which is why I replaced it from a donor board. \n\nCould it be R3550? I'm getting 32.7 Ohm and on diode mode pin 1 is OL and pin 2 is 1.04v.\n1. P3V3WLAN_SS - 003v\n2. PM_WLAN_EN_L - .002v\n\nPP3V3_S3 - 3.35v\nP3V3WLAN_SS - 003v\nPP3V3_WLAN_R - 3.35v\nP3V3WLAN_SS - 003v\nPM_WLAN_EN_L - .002v\nPP3V3_WLAN - .261v\nWIFI_EVENT_L - .221v\nPP3V3_WLAN_F - .185\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated."
