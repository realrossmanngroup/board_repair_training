            "message": "This time did a proper reflow (I did some research and experimented a bit on dead boards and I was sucking at it BADLY apparently) and got the system to work again. ASD passes and system is stable even after running CPU stresses or keeping it running for 30 minutes.\n\nOnly it has issues finding the SSD. Sometimes it finds the SSD and works for half an hour before the SSD is suddenly not found anymore and the system freezes. Reconnecting it sometimes works. When it works the SSD is fast so its not barely holding on or something, it fully works as expected until it just... disappears?\nAlready cleaned with a cotton swap in the slot and on the pins of the ssd in case there was any corrosion or dirt in there, looks clean if I use a flashlight to look into the pins.\nThe SSD looks like it was hit by the water though, there is a little bit of stickyness on the back but the side with all the circuitry looks mint.\n\nPossible issue with the motherboard or just another SSD that died because of one droplet of water?"
