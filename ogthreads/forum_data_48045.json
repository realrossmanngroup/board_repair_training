The connector and cable were completely clean of corrosion and no scorch marks.  \n\nbut on connecting everything up, I am getting visible stage lights.  \n\ni don't have a spare screen for this model so was wondering whether there is any other diagnostic I could try to determine whether the fault is in the cable, the logic board or the screen assembly. \n\n[ATTACH alt=\"7mx021xnDAbVUSO1fgijumhd0YeZvBjKa2QbHAf7d6ZeE4IQc77LS2zZOdvHVQi5wtasIz0bEyyLY5lNyGiWFBuJY4Nba6PAslsXP7fUzPMTyAxwX4vP8ANwdq0-iK0VTZE5zbFvp3zSd6WBTIND_3dnqAtQTqkq50Sp_5rWfVdRDBjOJegtS_M1c6iS3m1Hm4VCKHXiMnUZbCMUaXsKw_aMZdDb1pbsJiIUnZTxChFDDGlbavZ8ZaFSvTtekUm5Ytp7LznydhayeeMpzZGDoWq_DHJ7lp1v5aqbwTrPTdq0f6saZfQIA8uHJ1WDs6ehi71sQxTh0f75d_afPD0N91gsecofio8UihJNbHF-Y-0Rugc6071h-WfR8h0916lcLdxEdlTmGhdPxM8TpuMz-EMjbLmPPu0qpx1jnKs0AOxK8kpNs_5oGmjfcIcwjQpP-26I1E8lLVXNN7zjQ8H25Nyv6D7AfNtT6YtBThmEDm7nOTX4xA4MDCPG0OaMVCvqmXwSk3o8awASzAQITP212QiYPNEzv6tm1kNEWdXGaQBLjncEfrL69yXvG_bfbWVU-ZjLq43-sV_Zf0AIsXqQRfe62jzrK_kI2o3VsXjOPd5AJ8-TUTc2qcLhJgCJyoVXiU9jpQLDZtZsk0Q8kYOZy30T6luzCK3s=w1408-h1056-no.jpg\" type=\"full\"]48046._xfImport[/ATTACH]"
