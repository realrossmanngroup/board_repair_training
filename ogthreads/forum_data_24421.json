I removed the SSD to plug it into an OWC Envoy enclousure to make sure the data was fine and after I was done I simply unplugged the usb to the envoy instead of safely ejecting so I'm not sure if that caused this problem but now when I boot the ssd it stops around halfway and the screen goes black and shuts down.\n\nNow when I check the disk utility with the SSD in the enclosure or in the Macbook the SSD won't mount even when I click the mount button in disk utility. I even tried to manually mount using command lines in the terminal but it would not mount.\nI tried doing the first aid but it would fail and say to back up data if possible.\n\nI'm not sure what else I could do to mount the drive. I attached images of the disk utility screen."

It will give you a warning that it can't restore the volume but you can get at the data.\n\nNEVER unplug a volume without unmounting it, this is what happens....\n\nYou can also use diskwarrior to fix the volume if it mounts after a while, Disk Utility is useless for this."
