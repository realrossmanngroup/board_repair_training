No short on any of the 3 remaining pads.\nThought it may be bad bypass caps so injected voltage On pad 1 of C1768 @ 1v 4A and all that got hot was the CPU, nothing around it got hot on either side of the board.\n\nNot sure where to go from here?"

Removed F7040 got 12v5 no load from L7030. Chucked in some voltage on pin 2 pad of F7040. CPU getting hot.\nI'll check Q7100 now\n\n... Q7100 has a fat hole in it"
