L9008 was burnt, R9731's pin1 was burnt too, few led returns resistors.\nafter repeal and replace, the backlight has come back on with image. but every time i restart the computer, the backlight goes out.\n\nD9701 pin 1 has 12.46v , pin 2 has 27.54v when backlight is working.\nD9701 pin 1 has 12.52v , pin 2 has 12.5v when backlight stop working.\n\nPRAM reset. same problem.\n\nive replaced led driver twice. i also replaced, lvds connector even tho is good.\ni've tried few lcd panels and new cable already.\n\nbad boost circuit?\n\nSync problem?\n\nbad smc or mcp?\n\nreflash the bios didn't solve the problem\n\n\nif i wake from sleep, the backlight will turn back on."
