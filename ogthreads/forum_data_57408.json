            "message": "This board keeps killing batteries. It had some very minor liquid-damage on the LCD connector. Nothing near U7100 or the SMC. Diode measurements on the SCL and SDA lines are good at .502 and .500. The battery will work for a while but then lose it's capacity and die. We're on the third one. As soon as we installed the latest one the online diagnostic says that the battery requires service. All four U7100 current sense resistors are good. Everything seems very normal there. Not sure where to go next."
