Now, when I run CPU-testing apps like Novabench or TechTool Pro, the machine panics and restarts. I\u2019ve tried SMC and VRAM reset, as well as DFU Revive.\n[ATTACH]60945[/ATTACH][ATTACH]60946[/ATTACH]\nIs there any chance this is not a failing CPU and instead something else on the logic board?"

The fan circuitry had a missing PMW resistor R6052  (knocked off), which I replaced."
