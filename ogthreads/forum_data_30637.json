            "message": "I have an 820-2915-B that came in not powering on with a battery so swollen that the cells cracked the battery casing and a not functional DC-in board. Customer mentioned he had left the computer without every touching it for about 6 months because he was having issues with it powering on with chime but never any video on the screen. After replacing both battery and dc-in board, computer only powers on about 1 out of every 4 attempts and it only does this when both battery and magsafe are plugged in (light only turns green and never orange). When it does power on, I get no image on the screen and no chime, and the fans start spinning after a few moments then stop after a couple seconds and never start again. Even rarer, I do hear a chime but still no video, although usually I get the above described scenario.\n\nWith board out, I sometimes get green light and sometimes not when magsafe is plugged in, regardless I never get any fan spin. I also am getting 12.52V on PPVIN_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS whenever magsafe Is plugged in (with or without green light) but I never get VCORE_S0_CPU at any phase and the CPU does not ever feel like it is getting warm.\n\nBoard looks free of any obvious corrosion or physical damage, any suggestions on where to look next? Thanks in advance"
