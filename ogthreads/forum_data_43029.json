Top side looks clean. I included pre-ultrasonic pics. I've spent a long time cleaning up that terrible area near U3900 and U4200. Replaced everything looked bad and check for continuity and shorts. Everything looks good now. Not sure what's not working correctly here."

In my experience, U3200 pulls it down most often. I would inject 3 volts into PP3v3_G3H and monitor if anything pulls current. Your PPBUS being slightly low could point to the ISL9239. One of those is likely pulling down PP3v3_G3H and DCIN."

Remove CPU heatsink in such case.\nA thermal camera can help in this case. Or use the lips, instead of fingers, to check board temp..."
