            "message": "Got this board in with very light liquid damage. A few burned resistors near the SMC and U5110 were replaced. Green/orange light and a fan spin for about 1 second, then off. No cycling. Checked SPI ROM, area looks good, but tested without chip in place (no fan cycling) and also with another SPI ROM just to see if it would affect anything, it didn't. Replaced original SPI ROM chip. Decided to reflow SMC since there was liquid nearby, and no change. Pulled SMC to make sure nothing ugly underneath, and it was really clean. While SMC was removed, I checked continuity of all BIOS lines and they're all good. Resistors all measure properly. Replaced SMC.\n\nSMC_RESET_L is present (3.3v), PM_DSW_PWRGD is present (3.38v), as is everything up to PM_SLP_S5_L as far as I can tell. When charger is connected, fan spins briefly and VCORE/PM_SLP_S5_L both spike/pulse, but then to 0v and the board has no power again. Main rails present, no shorts. Everything after PM_SLP_S5_L missing.\n\nAnything I can check before deciding the CPU is dead?"

I would also inspect around SMC again for bad resistors/traces. \nIt is not true that anything after SPL_S5 is missing. If Vcore comes on then the whole power sequence already finished successfully."

It seems that after the fan turns on briefly, and then back off, I have everything before PM_SLP_S5_L steady (3v3/5v/1.05v sustains, etc). PM_SLP_S5_L is the first signal to be gone after the brief power-on.\n\nAs soon as charger is connected, VCORE spikes to 1.05v according to my scope.\n\nI'll check around SMC again, but have checked very well and everything is in place and no visibly damages or ugly resistors."
