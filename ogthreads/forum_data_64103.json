            "message": "Mouse tracking is sometimes unresponsive but sometimes works normal but it is consistently noticeable that it isn\u2019t working correctly.\n\nThis acts like a bad trackpad or cable but I tried both from MacBook that work normally and issue persists. I also connected external mouse and works normal so I know it\u2019s not just lagging or something. I don\u2019t recall ever seeing this and have it be logic board related. Seems like logic board is usually either works or doesn\u2019t.\n\nhave you seen this before? Any tips?"
