Using known good trackpad IO board and flex. J9500 is in perfect shape... not affected by the spill. Diode mode on pins 11&13 is good at .654\n\nresistors and continuity good around U5800. Replaced U5800 and U5810 to rule out but no changes.\n\nMachine runs at normal speeds with working keyboard&trackpad just has fast fan.\n\nwhat to check next?"
