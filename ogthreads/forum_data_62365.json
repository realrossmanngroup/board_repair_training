            "message": "Hi Guys, I have a 820-00164 that can runs off the battery, but no charge and not running of AC, no orange light. No shorts on PPBUS, 3.42v and DC-IN lines. No power on PPBUS or 3.42. D7012 is present, tried another U7100, Q7130 and Q7180 with no result. All resistors around U7100 measure OK, battery resistors measure OK. Re-balled SMC also didn't fix it. It can still be powered on from battery, not from charger after all above. On DC-IN line I have 312mah. Have also tried another IO board + cable. Board looks super clean no corrosion. Inspected battery connecter and IO connector all look mighty fine. Anything I forgot to check? Also tried different chargers."
