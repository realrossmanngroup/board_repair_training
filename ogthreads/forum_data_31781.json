You can melt another clip in place, but it won't be strong enough to withstand being re-stressed in the future. The best \"solution\" you're after will be a unit-level solution (i.e. you install the board into a unit and then essentially fix the RAM in place someway, however you choose), NOT a board-level solution. Period. Don't waste your time; max out working slot, move on."
