            "message": "hello I need some help. I'm stuck and need some guidance. I got this 820-2915 that came in with fainted green light at MagSafe. It had a short on PP3V42_G3H & PPBUS_G3H. I was able to relieve the short on PP3V42_G3H by removing ISL6259. Now I have solid green light but I still have a short on PPBUS_G3H and PPBAT_G3H_CONN. Please note that I still haven't switched isl6259. I tried to inject some voltage but I wasn't able to find a component that gets hot. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks!"
