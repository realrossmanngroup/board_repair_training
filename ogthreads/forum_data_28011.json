            "message": "i upload some pictures, the board is rather heavily water damaged around the lcd connector, when it came in id did not power on at all, after ultrasonic and alcohol cleaning it starts with chime but there is no picture or backlight, i replaced the LCD connector and cable, same thing. I only keep fixing it cause the customer accepted a high price for this repair. Please advice me based on the close up pictures if its worth to go on, i see many test points missing due to corrosion, maybe if lan or thunderbolt doesnt work it is ok, but screen, usb, wifi has to work for basic operation."
