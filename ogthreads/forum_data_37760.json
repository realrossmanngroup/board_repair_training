If so, it's going to be either the ISL, SMC or D6950 (May have got the number wrong, use brain to figure out which one I mean that pins 10 and 11 of the ISL lead to ;) ) If they are not shorted, Try a new ISL. If it still doesnt work, Take the edge bonding off the SMC and give it a reflow with flux and some heat. See if it works and go from there."
