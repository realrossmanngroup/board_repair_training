Could it be a sensor circuit?"

The voltage is just staying fixed at 3.4V - no drops at all. I disconnected the flex cable but can't get PPBUS to come up. It stays at 8.17V. When plugging it in, the fan doesn't spin for about 5 seconds. It then goes high immediately after starting up.\n\nThe board is completely clean with no sign of any type of damage. The LIO board and cable are both known-good. I have a good 3209 board that I use for testing. I made sure they were both working on that board. SMC_ONOFF_L is measuring very low at .070 in diode mode. Not sure what would be causing it to go low like that."
