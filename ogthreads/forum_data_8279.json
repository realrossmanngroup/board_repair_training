            "message": "I have an 820-00165 that had extremely light liquid to the top edge of the board (near U5110), and had no green light. Had a short on PP3v42_G3H, which ended up being the SMC (awesome). Replaced SMC, and got rid of the short, and got a green light, but no fan. Proceeded to check my rails, and found ppvrtc_g3h was only 1.28v. Hmmm. No obvious short on the line. Checked all caps on that rail and none appear to be shorted, and all look great. and replaced U1900 twice (with new/good chips), and no change. Cleaned the board well in the UC, and no change. All resistors along the circuit measure out well. The only other thing I can think of (and hope isn't the case) is a dead CPU/PCH, which is pulling down my vrtc line. Any way to confirm this? CPU/PCH does not get warm at all, of course.\n\nI'd assumed vrtc is always present, but maybe something is missing prior to even ppvrtc_g3h being pulled up? Thank you for any assistance in advance."
