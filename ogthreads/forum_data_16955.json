I inspected board carefully and the only corrosion I found was in R7006 area, 4.7ohm resister was bad. I replaced the resister and machine worked perfectly fine. I tested it, for hours, charged and discharged, after that put it up for sale.\n\nIn a week when we got customer for the laptop, it would not turn on. It didnt have green light or anything. Then I took it apart, and stated measure stuff to realize that I am getting green light again. I assemble it, and tested it again for 3 days running videos and stuff. So I put it back for sale.\n\nIn 2 weeks another customer was interested in the laptop. Guess what, the same thing. I couldn\u2019t turn it on or get green light.\nThis time I unplug battery and put it back in. It started working again. How can I diagnose this when it randomly not working, or what could cause macbook to work temperary ? Btw it was 69% charged when it turned on."
