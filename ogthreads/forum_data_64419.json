But as soon as you connect a pen drive, it automatically starts charging.\nAlready tried changing the ports, problem not solved.\nInstalled new usb ports, same.\nTried another charger, same.\nDidn't tested another battery.\n\nNo liquid spill, no signs of corrosion, no signs of fisical damage. All normal, except for the fact that it gets hot with only web browsing."

Macbook starts, powers on normally, but now ALL 4 ports have the same behavior: 20v 0a draw. System doesn't recognize when cable is plugged.\n\nGood side is: All ports are \"ok\", the black one is back to life.\n\nI'm assuming this cd3215 i've used is faulty. Makes sense? I don't have other cd3215 which is sad.\n\n\nIs there any compatibility issues with different models and cd3215s?"
