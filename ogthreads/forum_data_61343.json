            "message": "Hey guys, have a Macbook here with a short on PPBUS G3H which is solved, I now have a booting macbook \n\nThough the issue is the fan closest to the touch pad connection (J4501) goes full spin when booting, and the other fan wont spin at all with J4501 connected to the flex. \n\nIf I leave the flex disconnected the fan closest goes full on while the other one is normal speed.\n\nThe PPBUS that was short to ground was CB702, unsure if this matters or not, it's just near the flex :) \n\nThanks in advance for your help!"
