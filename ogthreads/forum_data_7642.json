            "message": "Hi I've got an 820-2784-A out of a mid 2011 21.5 iMac.  Only have #1 LED lit.  hitting the power button spins up the hdd but no video, no chime, no fans.  I've checked all S5 rails they are there.  Checked all S3 rails they are there.  I've checked all S0 Rails and the only discrepancy I'm seeing is PPVCORE_S0_CPU = .882 v according to schematic should be 1.1 v,\nPP1V05_S0 = .008 v according to schematic should be 1.05 v.  I pulled L7614 to check ohms on both sides on pin 1 i'm getting around 33-34 K Ohms, on Pin 2 i'm getting 21.6 Ohms.  What do you think?\n\nThanks\nMark"
