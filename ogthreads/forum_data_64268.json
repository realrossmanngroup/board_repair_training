            "message": "Hi guys.\n\nI have this Macbook 820-3332 MB with an issue with not showing a picture every time, and it usually happens when the battery is plugged in. There was some corrosion on C4905 together with R5076 and R5075, but I took care of that and also on the R3655 area but all resoldered. \n\nOnce I plug in the battery it won't show a picture, even with just the MB and LCD still doesn't show a picture, so I have to leave it for some time to drain and then it shows every time when just MB and LCD. I was suspecting U8900 in the beginning, but now I'm not sure. U8900 it's clean and no corrosion near it. I have also resoldered and checked all contacts on J9000.\n\nAny ideas? Thanks"

            "message": "I tried but it didn't work also i replaced it cause the original U8900 was overheating, some damaged contacts on it, which I rewired but didn't work. I solved it by turning off the GPU, to work only on the Intel, just the brightness it's stuck at 100%. \n\nThanks for the assistance"
