            "message": "Hi there,\n\nI have macbook for repair that has a strange trackpad symptoms. The cursor starts shacking (going left and right) even if the fingure on trackpad is very steady (like on Monday morning and not on Saturday after party). It does that randomly (like once in half an hour) then goes back to normal. Replaced trackpad and flex cable, turned the heater on but still shacking. Any idea whats going on here?\n\nThanks!"

I asked the customer if she has original apple charge and she said no. So I told her to observe if does have this issue only when charger is connected then we know if that is the charger case. Will post here later."
