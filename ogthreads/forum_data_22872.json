            "message": "Hello. got this in for not charging battery. It sees it and shows its connected but light on charger never turns amber and system report states that it is not charging. If I unplug machine will still run. upon checking the board i noticed the around the BIL connector there was liquid damage. Pin pads 1,2 & 3 were noticeably burnt off and pins inside connector were shot as well. I have removed the BIL connector and so far scraped away to copper to clean it up to replace with new one. Not sure if that was the best idea. This may be a dumb question, but... When I plugged it into the charger just being curious I noticed that no green light on charger anymore. I know pp3v42 goes through the connector that i just tore off but all pins seem to beep out as they should. So I guess what Im asking is did I totally fuck this up already or will replacing the connector make things green again? Here's a pic of whats done so far. Thanks. Have a good one.\n\n[URL]https://photos.app.goo.gl/DvAl1Z6s795kc8qm2[/URL]"

            "message": "thanks duke. Top resistor 1.9. Bottom was 4.1. I replaced bottom resistor. Now both resistors at 1.9kohm. G3hot is 19 volts. pp3v43 still missing. Does j6955 have to be on board to get pp3v42? PP3v42 was present before I removed it. Thanks."

            "message": "update: went digging for copper in pin 1 to fill with solder to reattach J6955 . Got scared cause I think I went too deep and stopped, LOL. Gonna have to run a couple wires after that one. I think I was going to have to anyway. However! ... pp3v42 is back, and I have no idea how. Any thoughts so that I can make sure it is secure and going to stay? Also pin pads 1 and 3 (Solder blob) are beeping out to ground. Thanks\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: I figured out what i did to fuck up pp3v42. Now i have some wires to run. Thanks. will update.\n\nUpdate 2: It is now charging battery. Now I have to sew this BIL connector back on somehow.\n\nThanks. Have a good one."
