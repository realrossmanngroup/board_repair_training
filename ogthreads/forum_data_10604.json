            "message": "Hi everybody,\n\nas the prices for 216-0810005 keep rising and the supply is short these days, my supplier told me that the manufacturers in china are using 216-0810028 as a subsitute. They seem to alter the BIOS to make them work with the 820-2915 boards. However, I have searched the web and couldn't find any information about this. The supplier can't give me any more information as the manufacturers don't share any details about this.\n\nWe have a very high demand for the GPU replacement on these boards and cannot serve all of our customers due to the lack of good GPUs and having an alternative would be great. Is anyone of you familiar with this?\n\nBest regards!"

In the generic SPI ROM or is it embedded somewhere else? If so, why would it be possible to do that change on PC boards but not on Apple? It's not that I don't believe you, I just want to learn something here :)\n\nThanks!"

But as I wrote we have a very high demand for those repairs and the supply of new, young 216-0810005 is not stable enough.\n\nThat's the problem, not the money.\n\nWouldn't it be cool if we could figure out a way to make this work?

And honestly tweaking EFI Vbios sections is way beyond me, i dont say it lightly either, i spent a solid few days trying to get a few different non Imac cards to work in imac's and fell over completely when it came to tweaking the EFI part of the bios. Not easy stuff, so id probably stick with the questionable 005's\n\nSurely you are looking at the wrong chips anyway, The 216-0833000 has the same core config (as stated on wikipedia) as the 005's and 084's, Which makes me think that the chip could be partial for downflashing and running as a 6750M or 6770M. Its probably not that simple though, and nobody would know what the fuck to do with strapping to make it work. \n\nMeh- May try it anyway see if i get anywhere. just gota wait for a 2915 that belongs to me first..."
