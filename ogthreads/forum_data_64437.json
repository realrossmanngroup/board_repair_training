Apple HWT result says \"might be something wrong with charger\" but I do have an orange light and shows charge sign before login to user account. Looks like no data communication is happening, do these have SMC chip or does the battery talk to the T2 chip? I have tried a new battery, same result. Any tips? Will remove the board and check for issues."
