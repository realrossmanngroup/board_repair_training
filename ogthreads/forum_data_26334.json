            "message": "This board had liquid damage and was repaired by me. I replaced LVDS socket and ran a couple of wires for damaged traces round the LVDS area.\n\nMachine works perfectly fine until it goes to sleep - either by time or by closing the screen. When waking from sleep i get backlight (apple logo illuminates) but no picture, only a narrow band of lines towards the right hand side. If i power it down (without moving screen) then power up the image comes back and is solid until sleep happens again.\n\nIt is not related to movement of the screen as i can move it firmly up and down and image is unchanged.\n\nAny ideas what on earth might cause this ? I've checked continuity of the wires i ran and they are fine. Thanks for any help."
