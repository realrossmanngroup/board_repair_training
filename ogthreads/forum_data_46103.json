Reflowed U8900 as per Duke's advice in another thread. Battery immediately displayed correct voltage.\nPPBUS_G3H on Charger without Battery: 12.59v\nPPBUS_G3H on charger WITH battery: starts at like 11.5v and climbs up.\nPPBUS_G3H without Charger and ONLY battery: 11.1v\n\nThe computer now runs off the battery, shows a percentage too. However the percentage jumps around a bit.\n\nMy question is, does PPBUS_G3H being not even 12v while on the battery indicate that there is something else wrong? Or should I call this done?\n\nThanks!"

After restarting it's installing again, we'll see what happens. I'm going to stress test it to make sure I don't get any graphics issues."
