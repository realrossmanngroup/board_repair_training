If U7320 dies, it can screw up Q7320 and Q7321. U7320 tells Q7320 and Q7321 when to turn on. If U7320 is destroyed, it might just tell Q7320 and Q7321 to always stay on, which burns them so they are always stuck on..which means they are always feeding U7320 8v.\n\nAND THE CYCLE CONTINUES! :(\n\nI would inject 1v and go from there. Pouring a layer of alcohol over the board makes this easier, wherever it fizzes, look there."
