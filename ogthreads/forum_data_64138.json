Only have 2442 model which is 14\" and seems not compatible. \n\nI can see the capslock light comes on and off and can hear the chime.\nThe customer mentioned he saw a faint screen (no backlight). I can't see anything. but sometimes if it was restarted too many times unproperly it falls in a recovery/pre-os loaded state.  Is there a way how I can skip the Recovery or other part pre-os loading?"
