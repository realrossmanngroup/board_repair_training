I tried a reflow in the SMC, passed to 8.56V and Mac worked, but died minutes later.\n\nI changed the SMC and it worked, but it did not start the system! So I tried a clean BIOS, system started, but it does not recognize the battery.\n\nSystem does not show battery icon and in information, this as \"no battery\". But if I shot charger, the Mac gets on for a few seconds.\n\nI tested with other batteries. I suspect the SMC or the BIOS file."

So replace the SMC, now PPbus is 8.56v.\n\nSYS_DETECT_L is 0.20v\n\nAnother information, it does not turn on only with the battery (charged). Only with magsafe.\n\nModel 2014, has ASD?
