            "message": "No water damage, this board was not powering up because it had PP0V9_TBT_X_SVR and PP3V3_TBT_X_S0 shorted to ground.\nRemoved R5640 to isolate PP3V3_S0 and board powered on fine and charged great but obviously no usb Data or HDMI output.\n\nI replaced U2800 with a preballed one and put back R5640, I have no more shorts but still no hdmi output and no usb data.  In the EFI boot menu I can see my external usb drive...\n\nI am thinking to grab a U2800 from a donnour board and reball it  (got finally the stencil). Thought maybe these chip come with some firmware...\n\nIs there anything else I can check before I replace the chip with an A1708 donnour one?\n\nThanks"

I tried also to load external macOs with a 2.0 and 3.0 USB drive and same thing.\n\nYes under Macos with internal ssd I tried both USB 2.0 and 3.0 no one show up on the desktop, checked also in disk utility no disk is detected.\n\nFor the redriver USB-C chip: if you are talking about the PI3USB3224BXEAE ic that doesn't exist on the 820-00875 board view I have visually nothing to say about it."
