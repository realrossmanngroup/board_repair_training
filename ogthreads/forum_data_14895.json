So I did a PRM reset and the keyboard is working.\n\nCan anyone point me to any documentation on how the PRM reset works and what it actually does?\n\n\n\nEdit: To clarify, I couldn't press Option to get the boot menu. So I tried Command+Option+P+R just as another bunch of keys to test with and it did a reset. So I pressed option on the next boot and got the boot menu."
