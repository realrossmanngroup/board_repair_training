            "message": "Good morning,\n\nI have a 820-01814 that is not getting into the S5 state\n\n\n[B]Device history: [/B]\nLiquid damage near USB C connector area. Hole burned into the board under connector. Shorting PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS. No matter how much I dug, i was not able to relieve this short. So, instead of continuing to dig into this board, I decided to bypass this line. What I did was remove the corresponding CD, mask the 4 pads under the CD for this line, then ran jumper from PP20V_USBC_XB_VBUS under the CD. \n\nThis got me to 20v.\n\n[B]Current state:[/B]\nCurrently the device is drawing 20v at about 100mA.\n\n[B]Power Rails: [/B]\nPP5V_G3S: 5v\nPP3V3_G3S: 3.3v\nPP1V8_G3S: 1.8\nPP2V5_NAND_SSD0: 2.5v\nPMU_ONOFF_L: 3.3v\nPP3V3_S5: 0v\nPP1V8_S5: 0v\nPP5v_S5_LDO: 5v\n\nSo, it looks like U7800, is this correct? Also, are there other prerequisites for the s5 rails to come alive? \n\nThanks for the advice"
