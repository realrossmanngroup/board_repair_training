The machine works perfectly but sometimes it just switches off suddenly.It can be within 2 minutes or after 2 hours.\nWhen it goes off the fan still spins . Have to long press the power button to switch off the machine and then again have to power on.\n\nThere is very little corrosion beside C1004 at the grounding point on the board\nC1004 Diode mode readings are 0.018. (Red to Ground)\nAlso looks like U1930 has some crap underneath it. I am unsure though.\n\nShould we reball the U1930."
