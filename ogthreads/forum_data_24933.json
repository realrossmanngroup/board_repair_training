It arrived missing bottom case screws and some logic board screws.

I think what happened is that the computer was most likely shipped in sleep mode or with a charged battery and now has no charge in the battery and a dead board! :rolleyes:\n\nI wouldn't have shipping a very expensive computer in this condition but I digress."

With measurements not making sense there is 0 chance of this being fixed.\n\nAlso are you using a REAL Apple charger and USB-C cable, MUST be original APPLE!"

Disregarding all past measurements, as I cannot remember under what circumstances there were taken. The board is getting 0V at F3050 and C3101. I have tried another known working LIO USB C flex cable, and the charger is a 29W Genuine Apple brick and cord. Could it be the U3100 chip?"
