            "message": "I have a MacBook that turn on fine, it is able to log in session sometimes, and instantly after it does pink screen for a second and restart, does it in loop. Sometimes it restart before the OS is fully loaded, and sometimes it is able to stay on several hours.\n\nHistoric : the MacBook fell flat on the floor and did this crash thing, screen looks fine. I was the first to open the machine after it happened. The only relevant thing I've noticed was 2 caps partially knocked off (C780B and C7821), the 0.8V side was kind of touching the 1.25V rail from 2 other caps in front of it. After this repair, the Mac was working fine, I left it few hours without screws on motherboard, then fully reassemble it. Next day I tried it and the crash behavior came back. Full tear down, new visual inspection, nothing particular. I left it a week without clue of what was wrong, I tried it again and it worked fine for 2 days, but the problem came back again.\n\nDo you have an idea of what could be wrong ? There is no sign of overheating on the thermal cam. Could it be the screen ? Honestly I guess the fall may have deteriorate solder ball under a major chip (PMIC, T2 or maybe M1).\n\nThank you for your time and feedbacks"
