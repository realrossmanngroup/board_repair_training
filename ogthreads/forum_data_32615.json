            "message": "820-00239 touchbar 13 macbook has a short on pp3v3_g3h, I can't find the short, I removed SMC and hall sensor and other capacitor because they were getting hot, but I soldered them back because they were not shorted. I use an external power supply but all resistor and capacitor on pp3v3_g3h line  gets quite hot, board absorbs 5A and voltage of external power supply goes obviously down to 0.9v.  what could it be? Any suggestion?"
