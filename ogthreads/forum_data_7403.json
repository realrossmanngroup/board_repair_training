            "message": "I have some issues with my MacBook Pro 13 retina Early 2015 (820-4924). One is that it does not run from the battery at all, Macbook turns off right away even its plug. It shows the battery and it shows only 72 present and that does not change. Now it does not show the battery at all. The other one is that it turns off not right away but after minute. And the third one is that the green/orange fades away and its really hard to see the light.\n\nAlso i don't have board view for the 4924.."
