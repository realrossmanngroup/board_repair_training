            "message": "Hi,\n\nhere i have another board, that had power issue... i replaced Q7130 and U7100 and now i have 16-20v on F7140. Between pins 27/28 on U7100 there is 20 ohms resistance, too much, right? I have replaced two U7100 and the result is the same... i have also replaced c7120,c7121,c7122,r7121,r7122, but still the same. R7120 is ok. What should i check next?\n\nThank you"
