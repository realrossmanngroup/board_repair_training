Yesterday, I've plugged magesafe, light ok, charging ok but not turning on, CPU warm and at some point fan was spining but nothin on screen, even with external light to check backlight issue.. no chemie.\n\nToday, I took board out, L7320&7310 are short to GND. That means CPU .. so game over ?\n\nThanks\nSam"
