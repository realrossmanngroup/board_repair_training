It has green light, no fan spin, and puls 0.027A from bench PSU.\n\nI have no history, but It seams that someone already replaced C7376.\n\nPPBUS_G3H is shorted (0.002 diode reading, and 0.1 ohm), and I have the same reading on L7130. All other big coils seams to have normal diode readings.\n\nCan you help?"
