            "message": "This was liquid-damaged through the back vent. It looks like the WIFI area and backlight capacitors are the only thing that got hit. But barely. Nothing looks damaged that I can see. I reflowed all the components in the area to make sure they aren't separated from the board. They were all fine but I wanted to make sure. Booted from external and internal SSD. No difference. Booted with everything connected and everything disconnected. No change. It will always restart within a few seconds of hitting the desktop. I'm attaching the crash report I was able to grab before it died. No Issues Found with Apple Hardware Test. Any ideas what might be happening?"

I don't have time to do this much guessing. Even if I had the schematic and boardview, this problem would still suck, so without them it's thoroughly pointless. Thanks for the pointers."
