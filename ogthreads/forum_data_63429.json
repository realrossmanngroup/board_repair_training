            "message": "Hi there,\n\ncurrently I'm working on a MBP A1989. It was my testing-device for repairs and ironically it just stopped working :-D\nWhen I got it, 2 years ago, the logicboard was slightly bent on the top left corner (corner of the Touch-ID) but it worked well for two years.\nNow it stucks at 5V. Im getting 5V 550mA on 3 of 4 ports. The last one is at 5.1V 170mA and PPBUS_G3H is missing on this single port. PPBUS is present when plugging it in with the other 3 ports.\nDoes anybody has an idea what could cause this?\n\nThank you very much and a happy new year to everybody :-)"
