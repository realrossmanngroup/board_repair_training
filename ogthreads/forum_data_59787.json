            "message": "I got a MacBook Air 13 2015, it was a liquid damaged not powering on, there was no charger light indication. \ni spotted corroded J6100 connector and remove it also corrosion on U7090 it has been repaired, lcd connector was corroded I also replace it. \nMacBook powers on works fine boot to system as it should battery was charging fine, it was working until I screw back main board then it want power on only green orange light no fan spin no boot. \nI've removed main board to check why it stopped working and board outside starts booting fine so it looks like there is somewhere corrosion and something looking contact. \nI spotted some liquid damage around smc so I reflowed in first place and than only fan spins, no chime no boot, same after reball SMC.\nI've checked all voltages from page 57,58 all correct \nAll termination resistors and traces checked all good \nPLT_Reset_L 3.3V\nPLT_RST_BUF_L 3.3V\nSMC_Reset_L 3.3V\nU7100 has been resoldered no changes \nU7100 resistance \n17-18 point 4 ohm \n27-28 point 32ohm \ntested on battery only connected, fan spins for a few sec and stop constantly \ntested on charger only \nVoltage on \nL7630  1.08V\nL7310 1.8V\nL7320 1.8V \npp1v05_s0 1.04V\nWhen I connect SATA HDD to USB it spin but LED is not blinking so no activity on USB. \nAny ideas ? \nIt looks like should boot up according to voltages but its not.\n I thinking now maybe BIOS died because of corrosion on Jtag ? It was badly corroded. \nThanks"
