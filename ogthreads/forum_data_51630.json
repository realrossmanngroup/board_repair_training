All power up 3V rail but the 5V is missing.   And ofcourse the PM_SLP_S4_L is not present.  \n\nPP3V3_SUS is as it should be.  \nPPVRTC_G3H is good.\n\nI do not have a working board as a reference.\n\nDo these boards all just die like this?  What am I missing?\nStatistically what is the common fail when they do this?  This has to be a signature issue because I have so many."

I am in new territory here.\n\nPCH_INTVRMEN is 2.3v\nPCH_INTRUDER_L 2.3v\n\nI believe this is wrong and may be the source of my problem.\nI checked resistance on those lines and it is quite high. No short.\n\nRTC_RESET_L 3.3V\nPCH_SRTCRST_L 3.3V\n\nThere is activity on PM_PWRBTN_L\nabout 1/2 a second after power on it pulses up.\n\n\n\n...........................................................................................................\n\n\nUPDATE.   I AM A IDIOT!\n\nI use a bench top power supply.  Old HP unit similar to what Louis uses.  I made my power cable long long ago off a brick I was given.  I was not sure of i'ts wattage.  I decided to cut and make a new one with a 83w brick just in case I screwed up here.  Presto.. boards are alive!!!!!!\n\nHOLY COW!  I was going down a rabbit hole!"

I cut off the cords and use a HP power supply.  Using \"original bricks\" will tell me nothing.   I do however need to use the correct wattage cord as the programming is in the head not the brick. \n\nI spent the afternoon digging through my pro boards and it looks like I have about a dozen or so that do power on and enter a S0 state.  I am off and running on these boards.  I am rounding up test screens now.   Time to move to Pro boards.  \n\nI can't believe I was such a idiot on these."
