            "message": "Hi,\nI'm on a 820-3462 board that does not chime. There is no image on screen, and no light if USB Mouse plugged. Fans are spinning.\nThe board is able to charge the battery, and remains powered on if i unplug the charger or the battery. This part of the circuitry seems working.\nI get the orange light on the charger, until the battery is fully charged.\n\nI measured 0.92V on PPVCORE_S0_CPU and 3.32V on ALL_SYS_PWR_GOOD.\nDid a few random check here and there; \nPPVIN_S5HS_COMPUTING_ISNS: 12.52V\nPPVIN_S5_OTHER_ISNS: 12.54V\nPPDCIN_G3H: 3.42V\nPP3V3_S4: 3.33V\nPP3V3_S0: 3.3V\nPP1V8_S0: 1.79V\n\nThe heatsink is warm; U1800 is warm (circa 60\u00b0C), and the coils L7510, L7520, L7550 and L7630 are warm too, (70\u00b0C)\n\nI found these posts: [URL]https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/820-3462-no-chime.3779/[/URL] and [URL]https://boards.rossmanngroup.com/threads/820-3462-no-chime-no-display.32104/[/URL] but original author didnt mention whether they found the cause.\n\nThere are no sign of liquid damage. Any clue ?"
