            "message": "hello\n\ni'm working on a 820-00045\nthe board looks pretty much ok\nno liquid damage, doesn't seem like been tampered with before\n\nbut still, no power...\nfrom reading around the board, i get this results..\n\nOn F4700 is 5.17v on both sides\n\nPP3V3R3V0_AON is 3.3v\n\nPP5V_S0 is 0v\n\nPP3V3_S0 is 0.020v\n\n\ni know that low voltage on PPDCIN_G3H is many times related to a short on PP3V3R3V0_AON caused by u4700\nbut in this case PP3V3R3V0_AON is present and resistance to ground is around 300 ohms.\n\nany help would be appreciated..\n\nthanks.."
