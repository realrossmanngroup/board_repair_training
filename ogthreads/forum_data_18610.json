            "message": "Hi all, I am new to board level repair but working hard on the learning curve and would like to give many thanks to Louis for his videos.\n\nI bought an 820-2936-A board and had green + orange light with magsafe and battery plugged in. I then decided to write down some values of U7000 to cross reference with another board I was working on but I think I shorted pins 2+3 and now I get no light at all! I have since been made aware of the existence of, and that I should've used, the test points to measure voltage not the actual pins so as not to cause the damage that I most likely have caused! In the meantime I'd be very grateful for some assistance in recovering this board.\n\nSome measurements that may prove helpful in assisting me:\n\nR6929 0v\nC6908 3.4v\nU6901 3.4v on PP3V42_G3H but 0v on all other pins.\nU7000 DCIN (pin 2) 16.4v\nU7000 ACIN (pin 3) 0v\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nMany thanks in advance for any responses."

I'm getting a green light at least now but still pins 1, 15-21 and 26-28 are reporting bad values.\n\nI don't know if maybe I'm not doing it right or if the chips are bad - I don't have the experience to tell. I have watched numerous videos on the process, I have tried letting the chip just fall into place as the solder melts, I've tried pushing it down firm, and I've tried letting the tweezers rest with just a little pressure but same results each time. I've cleaned up the joints with flux and solder afterwards and checked as much as I can that there are no bridges.\n\nIs there something else that could be causing the problems or do I just need to get this chip on right? Is it possible I've burnt something out on the board and is there a way to check for this if so?"
