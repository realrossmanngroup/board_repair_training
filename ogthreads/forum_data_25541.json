Replaced burnt corroded components around U9600. Started to replace stuff on the other areas but not sure if they are relevant to get power. Dont want to do all that work just to find out the thing is shot. Its been kind of my M.O. lately.\nAlso, some very light white shit (almost looks like salt) around bottom of U6100 pins and some surrounding areas. Doesnt look green, burnt or caked at all though.\n\nThanks. Have a good one."
