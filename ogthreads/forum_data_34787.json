No light on charger.\nDC IN board blown, replaced and same story.\nReplaced ISL its back to life but it charge battery only when Mac is turned off or when system is running its idle.\nWhen some aps are opened which need some performance from Mac then is stop charging and % of battery going down with charger plugged in.\n\nSame story with another ISL and with new battery.\n\nR7151, R7152, R7122, R7121, R5380, R5381showing correct resIstance\n\nResistance in U7100:\nPin 27/28 21.5 Ohm\nPin 17/18 3.2 Ohm\n\nAny ideas?"
