            "message": "Hi guys, this one has got me going crazy..... So i have an 820-4924 with no backlight, usually my favourite repairs. Sometimes it works for a day and then its off again. Board looks superclean. Changed the display cable as these are not good in many cases, same issue. Changed the display for a know working one, same issue. 38-49v on the connector, so it has voltage. So I assumed it was inside the connector, which i eplaced, still the same issue. Is there any othe voltage/dataline i need to get backlight besides PPVOUT?"

            "message": "39v is with the original display installed. 49v i got with my testing display, that is actually cracked.  Yes its always missing backlight, not a black display. When i turn it on display shows. I close the lid, open it again and the backlight is off. With a flashlight I can see the login screen. When i press the backlight adjustment keys the screen actually seems to blink. Will check these 2 lines now, what diode mode reading should these have?"
