I measured the following:\n\nPPBUS_G3H: 12.58\nPP3V42_G3H: 3.42\nPP5v_S5: 0\nPP5v_S0: 0\nPP3V3_S3: 0\nPP3V3_S0: 0\n\nCorrosion/build-up was around U7501 and Q7155.  Cleaned up in ultrasonic, but still get the same measurements above.  Can anyone help troubleshoot the U7501 circuit - I'm convinced the issue is here somewhere."
