Received a few sensor errors but assumed this was due the battery and display. \nInstalled a good battery and new \u201813/\u201814 display - no life on display. Tried quick fixes without success. \nPopped the test \u201815 display in and it works. Will work with two of my \u201815 displays and one of my test \u201813/\u201814s, but not two other known good ones. (With 2015 display I\u2019m unable to control brightness, not sure if related or typical as it\u2019s not the right year). \nNow when I try ASD I get \u201cstilling looping due to system running on low memory\u201d. Won\u2019t run any tests. In an OS the RAM appears, and no ram beeps. \nBoard is clean, no noticeable damage. L8300 has 5v with displays connected."

Can\u2019t seem to find a reliable flash drive that will handle the partitions.\n\nStill had weird display issues. At one point the 2015 display allowed me to adjust brightness, like when a 13/14 display is on a \u201815 - not very smooth. The 2014 worked intermittently and eventually stopped.\nFinally after multiple cleanings and inspections I knocked DP_INT_ML_N-3- R8318 loose. Pin 1 was gone.\nTested with this off and the 2015 worked. Not 14/13. This isn\u2019t apparently necessary for a \u201815 to function.\nReplaced r8318, ran a jumper and all is good again.\n\nMight be worth looking into tweaks around r8318 as a possible solution to no brightness adjustment with a \u201815 display.\n\nThanks. This one is solved."
