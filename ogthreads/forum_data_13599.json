            "message": "Thanks Louis and Duke, haven't been on here in ages which means somebody is building up his repotoire of knowledge and skill!\n\nAnyway am stumped and looking for advice today. \n\nMid 2010 IMac 27in. Backlight is gone however it does randomly come back on for no apparent reason. Then goes off again just as randomly. Can see image with torch and when plugged in to external monitor. \nI figured intermittent problem with led's so I changed inverter board out of working 27in. Same issue. Then swapped cables and then finally the whole LCD. \nNo matter the combo of parts the backlight is very inconsistent as to when it works or not. \nThe two screen are almost identical part number LM270WQ1 (SD) (C1) whilst the other is same except (C2) at then end. \nSo could it be the power supply? Or the ever so failable GPU??\nASD is only working efi not OS so hard to tell there if anything is up. EFI ASD is not suggesting anything."
