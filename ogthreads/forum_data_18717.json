Customer just dropped this one in where the fan runs high when it's turned off.\n\nHe said the HDD was upgraded so maybe thermal sensor, except that the fan runs at a normal speed when the machine is running.\n\nNo idea where to start; I don't even have files for this Mac yet."

This is maybe the third iMac I've worked on.\n\nThat said, I understood the problem differently to you; not that S0 was staying on but that S5 was sending 12v to a rail it shouldn't. But then fans run off PWM anyway so it would require a signal and not just 12v."
