I get 12.5 volts on the backlight fuse and Q9707 gate and source gets 12.5 volts so based on some louis videos ive seen when both sides have the same voltage the gate wont open. could that be preventing backlight?

Sadly last fuse i had got away from me while removing it from my last donor board. Ordered some fuses and will have to give an update later. If you guys think running a wire to get 12v from the fuse to the transistors around q9707 to push12v through the mosfets is a bad idea let know. So far its all i can think of to get this voltage flowing again."
