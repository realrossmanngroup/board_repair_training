Luckily it wasn't iCloud locked.\n\nAs I have another MacBook Air same model, I did use this to do the DFU restore but the keyboard would not work.\nTrackpad works however. Board looks pristine with no previous repair attempt.\n\nCould it be the T2 detecting a different keyboard and disabling it.\n\nI was able to do a PRAM reset it seemed (saw the Apple menu disappearing while doing the PRAM reset) \nI am also able to go into the boot menu to select the booting drive though I can't type anything in the Wi-Fi password menu at boot for example.\nIn OS mode, it doesn't react and Caps lock won't light up."
