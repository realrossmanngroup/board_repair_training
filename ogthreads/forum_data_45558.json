            "message": "Hi, im just a noob with some basic electronics skills trying to find out if my liquid damaged logic board is completely dead or maybe repairable. \n\nI started to check the power rails and everything seemed fine until I got to PP1V5_S0 which is on 3.3V.\n\nShould I continue to look other things, or this is the point where I need to start replacement logic board?\n\nuntil now I checked:\n- nothing is getting hot, maybe MCP a little\n- no fan spinning\n- magsafe connector is orange\n- smc reset works with a connected keyboard\n\nPP3V42 - 3.4V\nPPBUS_G3H - 12.45V\nPP5V_S5 - 5V\nPP5V_S4 -  5V\nPP5V_S3 - 5V\nPP1V5_S0 - 3.3V\nPP5V_S0 - 5V\nPP3V3_S0 - 3.3V\nPPVCORE_S0_CPU - 0V\n\n\nSadly, component level board repairs are not easily available here, so I am just trying to find out if its worth the hassle or I just have to buy a new logic board and replace it myself.\n\nAny suggestions?"
