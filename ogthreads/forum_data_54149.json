However, now I have image and the board is booting up like normal with an image. But the problem is now the keyboard and trackpad is not working. So new problems..

If its not the trackpad and flex/board as u described.. earlier the PCH became very hot. when I didnt have any image. maybe that was because I used 2.5 amp with SMPS the PCH got hot... or maybe some short inside of it, because a crystal clock was damaged earlier. However, I will check your info and revert back to this thread. thanks."
