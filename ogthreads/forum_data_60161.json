            "message": "Hello, I have a liquid damaged 820-00239, a little bit of liquid near one of the type-c charge chips and some spill near the IC that created PP3v3_G3H. 5v on charge port no amp and missing PPBUS and 3.3v. After replacing the 3.3v IC I get PPBUS at 13v and 3.3v goes to the charge chips. Now I get 19/20v and 0amp on the charger. No short on the large coils. What signals should I be looking for next?"
