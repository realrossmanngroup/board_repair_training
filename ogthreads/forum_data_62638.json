            "message": "Hi again all.\nShort circuit to ground on PPVRTC_G3H.\nI suspect the CPU is dead, but thought I'd check before writing it off.\n\n820-3437\nMagsafe light OK, no fan, no chime or anything else.\nNo signs of liquid ingress or other damage.\n\nI've removed all caps on PPVRTC_G3H, short to ground (0.08\u03a9) still there.\nI removed U1900 as well. short still remains.\nThe only other components connected to PPVRTC_G3H is the CPU (U0500), and 5 resistors - R1300,R1301, R1302, R1303 and R1450.\n\nPin2 of R1300 (PCH_SRTCRST_L) no short (925\u03a9)\nPin2 of R1301 (PCH_INTRUDER_L) no short (23.1\u03a9)\nPin2 of R1302 (PCH_INTVRMEN) no short (33M\u03a9)\nPin2 of R1303 (RTC_RESET_L) no short (20K\u03a9)\n\nPin2 of R1450 (PCH_DSWVRMEN) no short (2\u03a9)\n\nSo, all I can think is the CPU is internally shorted to ground, or there is a short to ground within the logic board PCB.\nAny thoughts?"
