            "message": "I need help with a 820-01700-A. It came with liquid damage and one completely dead usb-c port. Three usb-c ports was working with 20v and booting into the login mask. I fixed the liquid damage areas on the board. The most liquid damage was around UB300, UB400, UB700, QB701, LB700, R8601, C9081 and U5800.\n\nAfter changing the UB400 (CD3217B12) for the dead usb-c port, all four ports are stacking now at 5v and ca. 297mA.\nBecause UB300 was also liquid damaged, i changed it renewed it also - so UB300 and UB400 are new.\n\nI bought the \"new\" CD3217B12 chips from CN/Ali. They look like really new - not reballed. I hope they didn't sell me fake-chips. I Didn't see chips like this before - normaly they look reballed and used.\n\nHere are my measurements (sorry for the long list):\n\nPPBUS_G3H = 12,29V\nPPBUS_HS_GPU = 12,29V\nPPBUS_HS_GPU = 12,29V\nPPBUS_HS_OTH5V = 12,29V\nPPBUS_HS_3V3G3H_T = 12,29V\nPPBUS_HS_3V3G3HRTC_X = 12,29V\nPP5V_G3S = 12,29V\n\nPP3V3_G3H_RTC_X = 3,36V\nPP1V8_SLPS2R = 1,80V\nTBT_WAKE_L = 1,79V\nTBT_WAKE_3V3_L = 3,31V\n\nPPDCIN_G3H = 5,10V\nPPDCIN_XA_G3H_F = 5,10V\nPPDCIN_XB_G3H_F = 5,10V\n\nPCH_RTC_RESET_L = 3,00V\nPP3V3_G3H_T = 3,30V\nPMU_ONOFF_L = 3,30V\n\nPPVBUS_USBC_XB = 5,11V\nPPVBUS_USBC_XA = 5,11V\n\nPP3V3_UPC_TA_LDO = 3,35V\nPP3V3_UPC_TB_LDO = 3,35V\nPP3V3_UPC_XA_LDO = 3,38V\nPP3V3_UPC_XB_LDO = 3,38V\n\nPP1V5_UPC_XA_LDO_CORE = 1,58V\nPP1V5_UPC_XB_LDO_CORE = 1,58V\nPP1V5_UPC_TA_LDO_CORE = 1,58V\nPP1V5_UPC_TB_LDO_CORE = 1,59V\n\nHere comes the rails without voltage:\nPPVCC_S0_CPU = 0V / 2,92Ohm\nPP1V8_G3S = 0V / ca. 205Ohm\nPP1V8_S5 = 0V\n\nL9520 Pin2 (PP0V9_SSD0) = 0V (Diod = 0,34V\nL9530 Pin2 (PP1V8_SSD0) = 0V (Diod = 0,35V\nL9020 Pin2 (PP0V9_SSD1) = 0V (Diod = 0,14V, after a while second measurement 0,43V)\nL9030 Pin2 (PP1V8_SSD1) = 0V (Diod = 0,25V, after a while second measurement 0,40V)\nL9080 Pin2 (PP2V5_NAND_SSD1) = 0V (Diod = 0,08V, after a while second measurement 0,41V)\n\nEnter in DFU-Mode is possible."
