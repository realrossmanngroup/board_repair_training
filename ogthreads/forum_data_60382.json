One, a small section of PCB-layers missing missing off the corner beneath the audio jack, and the other a small crack through the board, right next to J6955.  Sounds much worse than it looks.  Two small dings that only seem to affect the audio jack.\n\nDoes not start in SMC bypass mode.\n\nTrigger of SMC_ONOFF_L drops PM_PWRBTN_L to 4.8mV, and PM_SLP_S4_L spikes to 305mV."
