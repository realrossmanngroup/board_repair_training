            "message": "00840 with no liquid damage\ncame in for a screen-replacement (original screen had one crack in it, so no heavy damage)\nSo this one has no audio \n(no audio input/output devices in Sound preferences, and under systemprofiler there is only listed: Devices, Intel High Definition Audio. Audiocode: 0 ).\n\nI measured around U6200 and verified all the VINs were present\ndiode-mode checks on HDA lines all look fine compared to a workingboard\n\nSo i figured then it must be the chip, so took one from a donor\nThan just to be sure i also replaced U6300 as the reball-gods were good to me, so i replaced both u6200 and u6300. \n\nAll to no avail: i still have the exact same problem\n\nany ideas what to check next?"
