Can I safely inject voltage or do I first need to remove all U72xx? When just connecting the charger nothing gets hot. Nothing looks bad as well I visually checked all PPBUS IC's."

After making copper line and replacing it, I have PPBUS restored but one of the charge IC had 5v no amp the other one 0.25A, replaced the one without amp and got the mac working again. Thanks, now the other one :)"
