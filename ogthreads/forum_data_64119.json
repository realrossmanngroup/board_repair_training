            "message": "Got this board with really strange issue. It runs normally, works everything, except when I put it to sleep. When the machine enters sleep state fan goes full blast and stays like that until I wake it up. When machine wakes, everything goes back to normal, fan goes back to normal RPM and system works normally as expected. Already tried replacing battery sensor, battery itself, HDD cable and disconnected webcam. Board does the same on another case. Tried ASD OS and no problems found on sensors. Replaced SMC, same issue, flashed BIOS with clean ME, same results. Board has no corrosion at all, looks really clean. Any ideas?"
