            "message": "The macbook boots up and runs. ASD EFI passes but ASD OS has 2 thermal errors \"unknown result code -- test failed\" and the fans are constantly running full speed.\n\nThis macbook had liquid damage, I replaced a couple of resistors near the SMC R5092 and R2502 and ran a jumper from pin2 of R5092 to PP3V42_G3H as that pad was gone. The only other corrosion I could find was a little inside the thunderbolt connectors.\n\nI tried another heatsink and thermal paste and checked that U5570 has 3.3V on pin1. Could this be a problem with the SMC?"

The fans are behaving normally now and the failing thermal test in ASD now passes. The 12.3V on PPBUS still seems low. Do you think it's something worth still investigating?\n\nThanks a lot for all your help as usual :)"
