            "message": "I have a tricky little board I would like some opinions on.\n\nThe green light on the charger is intermittent.   Some times when you plug it in some times it works  some times it does not.   \"most of the time not\"\nI watch it on the scope and when not working the voltage never comes up and there is no data.   When working totally normal including the after chatter.\n\nHere is the fun part.   I have replaced the SMC / DC-IN and Ribbon are my testers so they are definitely good.\nI diode checked and ohmed out the SYS_Onewire and compared it to a working LB and it is exactly the same.  I have also resoldered J9500 \"which was perfect without water damage\" and verified it is solid.\n\nLB will function properly off a power supply driven cord that does not need the SYS_Onewire signal to turn on power.\nI am kind of thinking the only thing left is a damaged line inside the board and I would have to run a jumper under the SMC but I am like \"no... way....\" !\n\n\nIdeas?"
