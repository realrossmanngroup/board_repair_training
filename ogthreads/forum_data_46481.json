            "message": "Hey guys i got one of these boards in. few patches of water damage. good thing is it is very recent. It is still booting but wanted to make sure and clean b0ard - i fluxed the affected areas and reflowed components. the only thing is c6499 is badly corroded and missing one end. I dont have any donor boards but before i make order i would like to test rest of machine. Would it be best to pull this cap off board for the time being. Will it cause more damage if I do?\n\nits only 3pf! and looks like it power audio amplifiers. thanks"
