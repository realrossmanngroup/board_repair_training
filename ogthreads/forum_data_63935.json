            "message": "Hi. I have an a2338 with liquid damaged. For the most it was minor and cleaned up relatively well. Now the issue is the battery icon has an x when logged in. System report says 0 cycles and service recommended. Fan speed is normal. \nIm still pretty new to m1 stuff so here is what i know so far-\nBattery connected \nPpvbat_aon - 11.6v\nPpvbat_aon_charger_reg -12.01 v\nPpvbat_aon_chgr_r - 12.01v\nSys detect - 3.3v\nI2c_smc_pwr_3v3_scl-2.2v\nI2c_smc_pwr_3v3_sda-3.1c\n\nWhen battery was disconnected i checked chgr_bgate and it was 12.01v\n\nSo there was liquid damage on j5151 on pin 2 and 7 and then had detached. I solder them back and some liquid near u5200 so cleaned that and checked for any shorts. None detected.\nAlso diode mode to ground on sys_detect_l and it was 0.404. \n\nWhat should i do next?"
