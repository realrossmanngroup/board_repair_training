It would power on, fan would gradually increase speed and eventually power off, and then on again.\nI replaced U6100.\nNow, it powers on normally, but it never finishes loading OS X. It gets through a slow progress bar (takes about 10 minutes), and reboots when finished to start that process anew.\nI've tried booting from an usb installer stick, which behaves the same way. I know the drive is working fine, or at least it was three days ago.\nI dont have time to work on this one any further today, but do I go back to measuring rails or would replacing U1900 and U1950 be the next logical step?"

Same happens when I touch the board's ground with the ground lead on my multimeter. This is with nothing but the magsafe charger touching the board, and fan attached. I dont quite know what to do with that information.."

Because you're holding the metal piece or by using a long wire you might also be introducing noise. I don't understand how this is affecting the board in this way though, since ground should be very low impedance and thus not notice this at all. Tried a different charger and/or IO board? More interested in this then I probably should be haha"
