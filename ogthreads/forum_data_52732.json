So I put in another known good battery, SSD as well as repaired the antenna cable. After getting MacOS installed, the serial number is not displaying. I found a post somewhere about using a program or something to \"program \" the serial number back into the board. Is this possible? The machine works great now except for the missing serial number. I heard also that you could take it to the Apple store and they could do it but where is the fun in that?"

Then I took the same dump, change the password to the password of the \"broken\" machine, then had the medusa fix the checksum and clean the ME. The damned computer would turn on but the screen would not come on. I could see the fan spin and how much current it was drawing but no \"bong\" and no image. So just to check that I didn't brick the computer I put the original BIOS back on and the machine is now back to working as normal without a serial number. So weird how by putting a BIOS copy from a known working machine into this machine would make it work and show a serial number, yet all I did was change the serial number from the same dump and fix the checksum and it stopped working. I also must note that I did a PRAM reset too."
