            "message": "Hello,\n\nI'm new to board repairs and I need your help. I have a MacBook Pro 17\" 2009 with an 820-2610-A motherboard that has a green light but it does not turn on. It does not have any signs of water damage, and besides of a few scuffs and dents it looks alright. The customer told me that it simply didn't want to start anymore, as I said no liquid or major signs of mechanic accidents.\n\nWhen I took the board out and connected it to the charger I saw smoke coming out from Q4260 so I have removed it. His father has a construction company and has a FLIR camera and with that I saw that U7000 was the \"hottest\" chip from the motherboard, in fact when connected to charger was the only one hot or rather warm (40[COLOR=#545454][FONT=arial]\u00b0[/FONT][/COLOR]C).\n\nI have a few measurements :\n\nPPBUS_G3H - 3.11V\nPP18V5_DCIN_ONEWIRE - 17V\nPP3V42_G3H - 3.41V\nSMC_PM_G2_EN - 3.4V\n\nStill learning so I may write something dumb or ask stupid questions ... so please be patient.\n\nAlso I have another board (820-2330-A) with the exact same problems (green light but does not turn on, no liquid damage) but I can't find the brd file to take some measurements, maybe you can help me with it.\n\nThanks !"

Leaved it plugged, done a few phones and noticed it was green again without doing anything. C7771  is 0V, PP5V_S3 also 0V, ordered today some caps and will try to replace it tomorrow but something is fishy. I saw on Louis's video that he had 8.37V on PPBUS_G3H, mine is 3-3.4V."
