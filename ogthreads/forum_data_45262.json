            "message": "Hey all,\n\nHope all is well. I need some help with a 3330 that's killing me. Has fan twitch and pulsing rails. 3v3_s5 & 5v_s5 are steady. 3v3_s3 & 5v_s3 are pulsing (so is PM_SLP_S4 so I guess that makes sense). 3v3_s0 and 5v_S0 are not pulsing, they're at a steady 0.13v.\n\nThe other peculiar thing is that the battery sensor thing shows that my good battery is 90% charged up, but the charger won't change to an orange light. PP_BUS_G3h is 12.6 with and WITHOUT the battery. However with just the battery (no magsafe) i get no signs of life at all, including no fan twitch.\n\nI checked ISL and the common problems, resistance from 17/18 is 2.6, 27/28 is 20.1 ohms. Replaced ISL just in case, still the same symptom.\n\nI don't have an 85w charger, so I've resorted to using a known good battery and charger.\n\nI'm leaning towards a short on an s3 line, but that wouldn't explain the lack of orange light right?\n\nAny help is appreciated."
