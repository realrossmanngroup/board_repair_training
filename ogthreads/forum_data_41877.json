Al ways are there so I decide to to put it back up and it works. Used it for about an hour turning it off and on to make sure everything is good. Turn it off and install the 3 antenna wires and no power again. When I check the  50_0_ANT, 50_1_ANT and 50_2_ANT all have a beep for short to ground.  Is this a norm because of low resistance? The laptop is back at no power state."
