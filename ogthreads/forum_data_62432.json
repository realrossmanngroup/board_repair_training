Could you help me, please?\nThis mac came from a customer that took it to a previous shop and they cleaned the board, and I can't tell for sure where was the liquid corrosion.\nThere were signs of corrosion near UB300, U7210.\nAfter replacing U7800, U7220, U7210, C7224 it started to get 20V and fan spinning. But the CPU is very hot, more than normal just after plugging the cable.\nCPUCORE_PWM1 - Pin 1 - 0.47V instead of 2.2V\nCPUCORE_PWM2 - Pin1 - 0.47V instead of 2.2V\nPPBUS_G3H - 13.02V\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 1.04V\nPPVCCGT_S0_CPU - 0V\nPPVCCSA_S0_CPU - 1.04V\nPPVCCIO_S0_CPU - 0.95V\nCPU_ZVM_L - 0V"
