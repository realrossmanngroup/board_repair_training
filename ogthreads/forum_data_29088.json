DC in board is clean as is the connector on the board.\nBooted into user environment and the Mac is snappy and I can not find anything that runs slower than it should.\n\nWould still like to resolve that error though. Any idea of where to start looking?"

A short causes it to not work at all in my limited experience so far."
