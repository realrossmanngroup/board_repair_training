            "message": "right, it was some corrosion under some components. Just putted it in ultrasonic for 1 more hour and now fan is ok, but trackpad sometimes stack. Checked trackpad and seems to be ok.\n\n\nP.S. tried new trackpad and new flex and same. Onboard connector is ok and seems that Volts arriving also are ok. As the issue is \"sometimes happenning\" i cant find what exactly make trackpad fail. THe only thing i noticed is that when i close the macbook and it sleeps, after wake up about 20-30 second trackpad stuck and work, after that 30 seconds it's all ok."
