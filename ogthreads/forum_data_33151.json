            "message": "System had water damage replace lcd connector a bunch of corroded components pertaining to lcd backlight. And ran some wires for broken traces on backlight boost. Replaced led driver im assuming if i had bridged any balls on led driver the system wouldnt turn on? I do get an image on screen and smc_lid is high my only guess to why i dont get a backlight at this point is that BKL_EN is not getting proper voltage?\n\nPPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT = 8.56v\npin 3/4 of lcd connector get 8.56v\nLCDBKLT_BOOST = 8.56v\nBKL_EN = 2.8v\n\nany ideas?"

Ill have to run a wire from test point of FB to A5 ball. PWM signal is present but at 1.4v\n\nill have to wait for my LED drivers to come in before i continue.\n\nis it smart to try and dig out a pad on A5 or is it useless once it comes off?"

            "message": "I replaced led driver again ran a small wire from a5 to PPHV_S0SW_LCDBKLT since the FB trace was pretty useless. I get 8.5v on that wire now but i still get no backlight is it because bkl_pwm remains at 1.4v and bklt_en is at 2.8v? Im stumped at this point.\n\nUpdate: found the issue i ran a wire to the wrong point removed and all is working. I do however get this theater light effect on the bottom right side of the screen also when turning the brightness down the left side gets darker than the right Its not a big deal but im wondering if its the screen itself from the water damage or the isens resistors at fault?"
