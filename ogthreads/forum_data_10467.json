            "message": "[PLAIN][SOLVED][820-3115] PPBUS_G3H trolling me, System not going further then S5 & voltage drops[/PLAIN]\n\nCustomer came in with this laptop which suppositiously have been peed on \"a little\" (Eww!!!!), the customer already cleaned the motherboard them selfs with pure alcohol in a hope to fix it them selfs but no luck.\n\nThe motherboard itself looks alright, it has some heavily green(?) corroded parts. But most parts are untouched or looking almost like new, the only few corroded parts are related to thunderbolt. I even tried to replace some of the really corroded parts but obviously that didn't fix anything.\n\nWhen powering the system on PPBUS_G3H drops from 13.3V quickly to ~3.4V and then slowly starts dropping until it hits 1.6-1.9V and goes back to 13.3V. At this moment trying to press the power button (or shorting the power_on test point) will drop the voltage again to less then 3.4V. This is exactly the same result you'd get by disconnecting the charger.\n\n\nAll the S5 power lines are up, it does not have any S3 power lines and if I remember correctly only 1 of the two S4 power lines.\n\nThe system has no fan spin (and obviously no chime). The charger has a green light, but only when you connected it before PPBUS_G3H started dropping, if this happened you'd need to wait 10-30 seconds before you can connect it with a green light. Connecting the power on a cold start it will always give a green light\n\nMy guess is that the charger's protection circuit is working and disables the power output because something is shorting. I have no idea what though, I've tested some of the major power lines and there is no short to ground.\n\nAny idea where to look?\n\nThese were the power lines by the way in a state where the voltage on PPBUS_G3H isn't dropping:\n\nPPBUS_G3H: 13.3v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_COMPUTING_ISNS: 13.3v\nPPBUS_S5_HS_OTHER_ISNS: 13.3v\nPP3V42_G3H: 3.48v\nPPVRTC_G3H 3.31v\nPP5V_S5: 4.97v\nPP5V_SUS: 0v\nPP5V_S3: 0v\nPP3V3_S5: 3.31v"

I hate working on devices that someone has touched before\n\nI'll replace R7013 from a donor board, is it safe to just short the two pins of R7051 with solder since the resistor is set for 0Ohms anyways? If not I'll just replace it as well\n\nEDIT: Ah whatever, I'll just move R7051 over as well, maybe that will make this motherboard be nice to me haha\n\nEDIT2: Using a 820-2936 as donor board there is no R7013 on all of them, even though its in the schematic. (Pads are clean, no solder) Is this a case where they forgot to note it as NOSTUFF?"

Since I was following the schematic I soldered R7013...\n\nIt had the same issue you describe, it was droping  all the way from 12,6 to near 0 and back again to 12.6v\n\nI did everything, replaced ISL 4 times, did again the soldering and checked back all traces, 18v transistors, sensing circuits, compared diode mode values... Hours and hours.\n\nI left the board 8 months on the shelf and one day when comparing another same working 820-2850, I discovered that R7013 was no stuff but not mentioned in the schematic.\nI removed it and it worked!\nThe biggest ultimate maximum troll I had. \n\nSo don't solder 1k R7013 and good luck?"

For me it seems PM_SLP_S4_L should be generated by the CPU, is this an issue where the CPU is broken or should there be another signal going into the CPU to tell it to go to a S3 state?\n\nEDIT: PP3V3_S4 is <0.5V, P3V3S4_EN is 0v. I think part of the issue is the system not even going into a full S4 state, lets see if I can find out whats causing this\n\nEDIT2: PM_SLP_S5_L is low, so there is no attempt going into a S4 state\n\nEDIT3: PM_PCH_PWROK is low, SMC-DELAYED_PWRGD is low. Bad SMC? It looks good around so probably not, I'll keep on digging to see what might be wrong\n\n[QUOTE=\"jadao, post: 10496\"]So don't solder 1k R7013 and good luck?[/QUOTE]\n\n\nGlad I didn't haha, thanks for confirming!"
