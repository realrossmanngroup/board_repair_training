            "message": "Hi everyone,\nI know this is not a mac related issue. I have seen couple of acer laptops where they don't turn but take charge. So, when the power button is pressed, the power led comes on for a a sec or two, the fan spins, you hear the hard drive click and powers off. Most of the times what I i have done is take the battery out, unplug the charger and press/hold the power button for 1 minute and put the batt back, it turns on. Any help is appreciated. Does anyone have a logical explanation?"
