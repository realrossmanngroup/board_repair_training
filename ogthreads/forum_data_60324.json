            "message": "Hi again, I got this motherboard, it had corrosion on R7109, cleaned the pads and changed the resistor.\nStill getting short on L7410, 7420 and 7430\nDiode Mode on those coils are:\nL7410/7420/7430 = 0.02\n\nEdit\nI found out that PPBUS_G3H_CPU was shorted too what lead me to PPBUS_G3H. Removed F7000 and have a short to ground on PIN 2 F7000\nResistance from PIN 2 from F7000 to ground is 1.6 ohm\nFrom PIN2 F7000 to L7410/7420/7430 = 0.2 ohm\n\nShould I replace U7100 or is it a dead CPU already?\nThank you!"
