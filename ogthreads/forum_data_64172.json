Checked all SSD voltages and reset lines, all good.\n\nUnderstand we can't just boot from a USB installer on these T2 models.\n\nI've tried Catlina internet recovery installation, while plugged via ethernet, it allows me to select the drive then gets me to accept terms and after crashes. Then loads back into the folder logo. \n\nThis may be something super simple.\n\nThank you in advance for your advice."
