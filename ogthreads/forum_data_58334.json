            "message": "Hi, have this A1398 with some super weird problems I?ve never seen before. I got it having a short on PPBUS. This was cleared after removing MOSFET Q7260 which cleared the short. Replaced it with a donor and as soon as I gave it power it got very hot and PPBUS was shorted again. I checked out U7201 and found it outputting 12V to a 5V line. Replaced it and the mosfet with another donor and no more short on PPBUS. Still won?t boot though. U7201 has an Enable of 3.02V instead of normal 3.3 but it does have the supply of 12V. Is the low Enable a Problem? Anyone got any tips? Thanks!"
