However, it can only function as a voltage divider if the bottom resistor, R9789 has a path to ground, or else it will just send pin 4's 12.6v to pin 3 of Q9706. \n\nQ9707 determines whether R9789 gets to have a path to ground. This is a dual N channel MOSFET - it will allow power from source to drain when the voltage on the gate is higher or the same as the voltage on the source. Here the source is ground, which is 0, so anything on the gate will likely open it. \n\nSo one of four things is occuring here.\n\n1) C9782 is shorted and fucked, causing 12v to always be on pin 3 of Q9706.\n\n2) R9789 is corroded/burned/bad.\n\n3) LCD_BKLT_EN or BKLT_PLT_RST_L are missing <--- this is usually the case when the machine does not see the screen\n\n4) Q9707 is fucked/bad.\n\n5) Q9706 is fucked/bad shorting pins 3 and 4 together.\n\nSeeing as you claimed you had no image, we should be troubleshooting no image rather than no backlight I feel. However, since you said you had backlight with 12v on backlight, which is impossible, I have no idea what it is you are seeing at this point, as the light will not turn on without 26-27v on this model..."
