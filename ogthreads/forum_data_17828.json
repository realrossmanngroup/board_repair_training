So in the OS the keyboard does not work apart from the power button, but this is part of the keyboard anyway isn't it?\nTrying to use the keyboard by trying to get it into target disk mode:\nSwitch on and hold T, does not work, it just loads into the O/S.\nHaven't started checking voltages yet, am getting a flex cable for the trackpad and external keyboard and mouse both work OK, but does the power button somehow work independently to the rest of the keyboard?"
