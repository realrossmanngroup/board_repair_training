            "message": "Got this liquid damage board. I have 20V on usb-c meter.\n\nWith battery I get 20V 2A so it seems charging well, the fan spins also with and without charging cable.  Without battery I get 20V 0.55A.\n\nBoard reacts to power button, opening the lid, pressing the trackpad or a keyboard key. I can see the fan stopping with 0A on the usb-c meter. an it goes back to 20V 0.55 when I press again the power button.\n\nThere is no image, no backlight and no boot, tested also hdmi with external monitor and disconnected internal lcd cable.\n\nI have these voltages at the coils:\n\nL7030 : 12,60V\n\nL7690 :   3,3V\nL7670 :  5,0V\n\nL8410 : 0,08V (backlight coil)\n\nL8100 : 1,2V PP1V2_S3\nL8102 : 0,959V PPVCCIO_S0_CPU\n\nL7702 : 1,035V PPVCCEDRAM_S0_CPU\nL7270 : 1,021V PPVCCSA_S0_CPU\n\nL7210 : 0,824V PPVCC_S0_CPU\nL7220 : 0,825V PPVCC_S0_CPU\n\nL7410 : 0V PPVCCGT_S0_CPU\nL7420 : 0V PPVCCGT_S0_CPU\n\n\nTried a DFU revive then restore but nothing changed. SMC bypass also doesn't change anything.\n\nTried also the board with nothing connected and noticed suprisingly  that without the trackpad cable plugged in the board will go to 20V 0,12 ->0,55A then after 3 secondes come back to solid 20V 0A at that time I will only have 3.3V and 5V. If I press the power button it will simply repeat 20V 0,12 ->0,55A for few seconds and come back to 20V 0A.\n\nI don't know at this point what to look or check further...\n\nThanks"

I have no way to use them without sweep function.\nI think I have a good idea about cavities, transducers, dead or hot spots and standing waves.\n\nThis board didn't have the acid very agressive damage that we are used to see from time to time, not the kind of damaged board where components come off alone. After ultrasonic, the board is in pristine state not the greyed discolored components from over ultrasoniced board.\n\nUnfortunately I had to return the laptop, If I had time, I would have check the SLPS2R and AWAKe voltages and probably reflow slightly the T2...\n\nThanks as always."
