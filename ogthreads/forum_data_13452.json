Most of the water corrosion is around lvds and thunderbolt area, around u7400,  all over dc in area, and smc looks pretty ok as well as the RTC clock chip which looks fine.  First time I powered it up, green light and quater fan spin.  Then I look around RTC area and looks clean but after I plugged it back in, no more spin and stays like that.  So i decided to went ahead and replaced U2600  and I double check all my RTC power on R1800,1,2,3 but it's all there so no progress. \n\nWhat is present and what is not:\nAll the rail is present in order down up until PP5V_S3_REG\n\nActions taken:\nI followed the pp5v_s3 to where it's created and took me to u7200.  Master EN pin 13 is present 3.44v\nEntrip 1 is not present the down the rabbit hole started.\nQ7221 is the mosfet controlling the enable. pin 6 is nothing but on pin 2, is 3.46v. like it's not passing through the n-channel mosfet...? I check traces, continuity and everything is just fine and dandy on that little area...\n\nBut anyways I followed up where P5VS3_EN_L was created and PM_SLP_S4_L was missing but pp3v42_g3h_reg is present.  Further down to the cpu which makes the PM_SLP signal\n\nU1800  on the (IN) side\n\n-PM_SYSRST_L   (0.0v)\n-PM_PCH_SYS_PWROK  (0.0v)\n-PM_PCH_PWROK  (0.0v)\n-PM_RSMRST_L  (0.0V)\n-PM_PWRBTN_L  (3.47V)\n-SMC_ADAPTER_EN  (3.44V)\n-PM_BATLOW_L  (3.30V)"
