I found a short in the PMIC U9580 and replaced it. after that I had 20V and up to 1A current, then back to 0A at 20V and so on. I detected another short in PP2V5_NAND_SSD0. Also, an SSD gets hot very quickly at the edge when injected with 1V.\n\nI think the SSD NAND is defective. \n\nThe customer needs a file from the SSD, he says he would be dead otherwise, not sure if that was serious, hope not.\n\nIs there a variant to save this or does anyone of you know where I can get this done. Money is not an issue says the customer."
