            "message": "Board has no signs of liquid damage. Came in with dead battery and no power. When I plug in adapter I get .4## Volts on PPDCIN_G3H. Also QB400 gets very hot and after about 30 seconds the charger cuts off. \nI only have the center portion of a donor for this board as I could not find the right side on ALI. I did however order FDPC4044's from mouser and new ISL's as well in hopes that those would be the issue. After replacing QB400 I still get basically nothing on PPDCIN_GH and QB400 is scorching hot.\nI have zero experience with this board and to be honest am a bit intimidated, LOL. Here is what I get on he power meter. ------------> [url]https://photos.app.goo.gl/fmqazwSWFTkddYmk9[/url]\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks!"
