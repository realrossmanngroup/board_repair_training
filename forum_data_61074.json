        "message":"Hi there.\n\nI have an A1708 13\" MacBook Pro. 2017 Year. I have no history of this MacBook. After removing bottom cover everything is clean and appears new. There is no indication any work has been done. Everything functions as it should, just high fan speed and system runs extremely slow. I removed the logic board and checked all areas of the board with my microscope and there is no corrosion anywhere. Where do I go from here?"
