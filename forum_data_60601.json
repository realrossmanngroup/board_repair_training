        "message":"Hi Guys, came across to 820-3332 which turns on and chimes, but no screen neither internal nor external. No Capslock response either. \nNo liquid damage, but very dusty and must have been overheating for a while. \n\nNot sure if its GPU issue or something else I should look for. CPU\/GPU gets very hot, probably the reason for the loud fans. \n\nAlso, it does not turn on without a battery. Is it usual for these models?\n\nThanks"
