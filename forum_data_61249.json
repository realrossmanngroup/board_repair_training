        "message":"I have seen this a few times but never really fixed it.\nThe PP5V_MAIN_ALSCAM_F fail was dead at J8550.   A burnt inductor was obvious on the LB.\n\nRepaired the damaged traces and was able to return power to PP5V_MAIN_ALSCAM_F at J8550 but still no display.\n\nThese machines come in for damaged displays and when they replace the screens and they still don't work I end up with them.  I was  wondering if anyone has figured out what else gets damaged when this goes.   There is a similar fault on the 820-01521 and my repairs have met a similar fate.   All the rails on J8550 are present and the machine does boot just no image."

        "message":"Do you mean J8500?\n\nL8570 usually fails because of short in the video flex, inside LCD panel.\nLiquid spill inside of video connectors can also generate such issue.\nThe big problem is that some camera data lines go to T2, there is not a separate camera chip (like in previous models).\nU8595 doesn't completely separate camera and T2.\n\nI think T2 maintains a relation between camera, LCD connector and eDP output.\nCheck diode mode to ground on data lines of camera and eDP.\nAlso try changing U8595."
