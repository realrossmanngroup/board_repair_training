What could be happening?? Should I inject voltage on that line to see if there is something wrong?\n\nUPDATE: waited a few minutes and connected it to the usb c port which worked the first time, it went to .700A, connected it to the other usb c and goes to .025A and 0A repeatedly. If I go back to the usb c which worked right away it starts doing the same behavior..."
