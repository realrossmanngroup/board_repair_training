Only suspicious part seemed to be SPKRAMP_INT_L which still measures 0.46Vdc in diode mode at R6400 test point, which aligns with a functioning board board. However, this trace leads to T2 and I am wondering if trace leads from the test point instead from the R4600 to the T2. \n[ATTACH type=\"full\" width=\"282px\"]61449[\/ATTACH]\n\nCan you remind me what the _L was in the trace name? Would this line needs to be hold low for normal operation?"
