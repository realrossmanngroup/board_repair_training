        "message":"Hi, got a A1708 820-00840 here that had a tiny liquid spill.\n\nNow it doesn't see the SSD, neither in partition selection nor in disk utility.\nAlso, most of the time WiFi will not work, but sometimes it does.\n\nThe spill was in between the WiFi\/BT module and the SSD connector. But it was tiny and did not leave any corrosion behind after cleaning.\n\nAll power rails on the SSD connector are present. I am guessing some kind of PCIE signal, but I have no idea about those. Kind of stuck here.\n\nAny idea?"
