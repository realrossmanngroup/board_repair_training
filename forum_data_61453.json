Also booting with an external drive is not possible.\nWhen the machine came to us, she did not start at all.\nI can not see fluid damage or other marks of damage.\n\nIt boots normal to the point where it takes something arround 180\/181mA for 30 seconds. \nThen it goes up to something arround 230\/250mA and crashes down and boots again. \n\nI have tried to find the error with the boat sequence chart, but i stack now with this board for hours.\nI hope you can help me coming forward."
