        "message":"Hi, I'm new to board repairs but have been dealing with them and sending them to other companies for about 7 years.  This year I put myself on a micro soldering course and have been building myself up from console repairs, laptops, iphones and and now macs.  So - sorry if I sound a bit noob.\n\nThis is a strange one so I'll try and provide as much info as I can.  Mac came in because it is not powering on. When I plug a metre\/power into it it pulls 19.8-20v and cycles through the amp draw as if it is booting normally and at around 1.11a draw the Apple logo is seen and the mac boots perfectly (without pressing the power button to turn it on) and also works perfectly when logged in.\n\nIf you leave the mac at the login screen eventually it will power off, pressing the touchpad shortly afterwards turns the mac back on and it boots fine. \n\nIf you shutdown the mac it will not power on using the power button and it is drawing 0.01a at 20v.\nAt this point if I disconnect the battery and reconnect the battery the mac will switch on and boot fine as soon as you plug in the power cable.  If power cable is not plugged in, pressing the power button doesn't turn the mac on.\n\nI have tested a new battery but the problem remains exactly the same.  Battery is seen and charges to 100% and discharges as you would expect during use - once the mac is powered on it will run on battery fine.  If I hold the power button down when the mac is switched on it will switch the mac off. \n\nBoard is immaculate, no sign of any damage.\n\nIn summary, the mac powers on by plugging in the power cable only after disconnecting and reconnecting the battery.  Power button doesn't power the mac on at any stage but will power it off.\n\nThanks in advance."

        "message":"First of all, welcome to the forum!\n\nAll iCore MacBooks power on automatically when charger is connected, if battery was disconnected.\nThis doesn't happen again, once machine was properly turned off from macOS.\nIf disconnect the battery, will occur again the same behavior.\n\nAll T2 MacBooks also turn on directly pressing any key, or trackpad; without touching power button.\nIt will go off if remains too much time in password screen.\n\nIf machine turns off holding down the power button for 4-5s, the button is good.\n\nYour machine, may have a hardware issue, but first step for ALL T2 machines is trying DFU mode.\nYou can go directly for Restore option, if no important data on its SSD.\nIf need to preserve the data, choose Revive; it will not erase the SSD."

This morning I managed to revive the target machine but after around 70% completed of stage 4\/4 the screen went black , I left it for about 5 minutes before putting it back into DFU mode.  However, Apple configurator now shows  a padlock rather than DFU and no AC functions work.  The target device I have checked for EFI password which it doesn't have and the security settings are disabled.  Any advise would be appreciated - FYI currently no change to original problem."

If I connect to a network it does nothing and eventually error's (see attached) - I don't believe there is an issue with the SSD as prior to erasing it with Apple Configurator I had already taken a time machine backup and clean installed Monterey without issue.  Is it still possible to boot to target mode on this device as it is?  I did some digging and target mode seems to no longer be a thing on these M1 - seems you have to boot to recovery and \"share\" which I now can't do?"
