        "message":"Hi Guys, this board had liquid damage after cleaning and removal of a bunch of burned PP3V8_AON_MPMU_ISNS_VIN  filter caps, it turned on. \nBut now it's stuck at 5V 0.01A and I measure short (0.55Ohm) between C81D7 and C81H1. Seems to be in\/out of the U8100.\n\n[ATTACH]60393[\/ATTACH][ATTACH]60391[\/ATTACH]\n\nAnything else I can do? I have a donor board from where I may be able to get U8100, but seems an awful work without a stencil. Also not sure if that's performant there. \n\n[ATTACH]60392[\/ATTACH]\n\nAnything I can check?\n\nThanks"
