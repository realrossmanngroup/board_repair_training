        "message":"Hi Folks,\n\nI got the PPS2116A power supply and am having trouble getting magsafe plugs to work with it.\nThe magsafe cable only has two wires in it, one is + and one is GND, when I connect it to the PSU and set the Voltage and Amps as printed on the original power brick the cable was attached to... no magsafe light, no charge, nothing. The Mac works fine (using a beater MBP in case I blow it up) and with another normal charger, no issues.\n\nUp to this point, any mistakes I've made in connecting, Voltage or Amps setting?\n\nNo experience with an external power supply so very much still in the learning phase. Any help appreciated :)"

Slowly it builds up a charge but the >500kOhm from the multimeter is already enough to slowly drain this.\nJust to be sure, can you see if it works by connecting it to Positive and Negative instead of ground? I think ground is more like the earth wire which you definitely shoudnt just connect things to, I've always used the Positive and Negative on my supply\n\nI use the Velleman labps3005N with great success but it's a European company so I think it's hard to get in the US"
