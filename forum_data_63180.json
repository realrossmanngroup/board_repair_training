U2800 was shorted and has been replaced as well with a new chip from Mouser. All traces affected by liquid measure good.\n\nWhen trying to plug into U3100T the amp meter only comes on if inserted one way facing down. If inserted facing up the meter doesn't come on. Same goes for U3100R.\n\nAll LDO voltages are present. What should be checked next?"
