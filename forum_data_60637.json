        "message":"Received a Late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro 15 inch today. It's randomly shutting down which I have replicated. I've read around and i'm seeing U7310 listed as a common failure point on these boards. The only issue i've got then (assuming correct diagnosis) is that I cannot find the recommended replacement of FDMF6708N in stock anywhere at any reputable suppliers. I can get FDM6823A and FDM6820A from a reputable supplier but am unsure if these are compatible replacements as there seems to be some minor differences. - Pin 1 of FDM6708N is ZCD_EN but on FDM6823A and FDM6820A Pin 1 is SMOD.\n\nAny thoughts on possible replacments or sources of FDMF6708N?"
