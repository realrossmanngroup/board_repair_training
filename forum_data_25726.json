Won't turn on. \nPpbus g3h is 12.4v\nsmc_reset_l is high at 3.4v\n\nim guessing this is why we are not turning on. I tried shorting it to ground as I assume that would be like doing an smc reset but no change in anything. \nFigure I have to figure out smc_reset_l before going any further. \nIs it more likely a faulty smc causing this high reading or U5010 which as far as I can tell is working as it should. \nThanks."

My understanding of it was reversed. \nSo made a mistake. Went to measure resistance of pin 17\/18 of the ISL. Charger was still plugged in and I made smoke.. Pads 16\/17\/18 all disinter-grated. I have an ISL from another board on the there with jumpers made.\nI get a green light, no orange light and laptop won\u2019t power on.\n\n\nNow to answr the questions.\nResitance over pin 17\/18 is 1.6k ohms.\nPin 27\/28 is 20.3 ohms\nPPBUS_G3h is 12.5v with charger plugged in 11.3v battery only\nSMC_BC_ACOK is back and 3.4v\nPP3V42_G3H is 3.4v\nBattery indicator is working\nC1802 is 3.4v as is C1803\n\nAnd there you go. Just found PP3v3_s5 all over the place. It  drops from 3 to 0 and everything in between. \n\nGoing to go look at that now. Thanks for the questions Duke. I\u2019ll write back if\/when I get stuck next!"

I have pretty much given up on this though, it's a mind fucking rabbits hole I've concluded.\n\nU7000 isn't even on the board, neither is C7050, R7051 or R7052. R7050 is also off the board.\n\nWhen I touched ground and pin 2 pad of R7051 and R7052 it would beep. When I touched on R7050 and ground it would also beep. Something else has obviously happened since I took those measurements, as even the other side of F7040 beeps now.. I figured the line is shorted inside the board layers so I cut the via's to the pads on R7050,R7051,R7052. Pads no longer beep. I start putting it all back together with jumpers and notice that those lines beep to ground again. WTF. This whole time I'm also testing against another board (although dead) and having different and as expected results.\n\nCurrently there is no u7000 on the board or R7050. Nothing beeps to ground in that area anymore. I put R7050 back on, it beeps. I take it off it doesn't, I take one from another board, test continuity of R7050 before putting on and no beep. Put it on, touch ground and it beeps. Take it off and pads don't beep but R7050 now does. \n\nAnd that was it. I went home for the night. I have 12 iPhone touch ic's waiting for me in the morning. May as well stick to what I know, doubt I'll be looking at it again. I reckon that 'mistake' fucked it big time. It only cost me $40 anyway.\n\nCheers"
