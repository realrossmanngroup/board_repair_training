        "message":"Hi, i have an 820-3115-B with issues on the audio Jack. The jack itself and the board look pristine.\n\nThe jack only works before playing any audio (if i plug it after playing something it will not detect). If i close\/open the lid it is detected again. The audio has a ton shit of noise. The jack is receiving 3.3v. Also tried another OS installation.\n\nI compared the diode mode on the data pins with a good working motherboard of the exact model and i got this:\n\n                                             Good Board                \/              Bad Board\n\nAUD_CONNJ1_TIP:             0.592     \/                                     0.753\nAUD_CONNJ1_TIPDET:      0.596      \/                                    0.754\nAUD_CONNJ1_RING:         0.599       \/                                   0.755\nAUD_SPDIF_OUT:              0.6           \/                                    0.6"

        "message":"I have a somewhat similar issue on a nightmare-ish 3115 (jack not detected when hot plugged, need to put the machine to sleep then it is detected but with heavy distortion on the headphones, speakers work fine) but with heavy liquid damage. Haven't solved it yet, I'll come back at it in a while. Voltage measurements showed some discrepencies compared to a known good board on the audio jack analog outputs, one of them is also used for jack detection when shorted to one jack detect line IIRC. In my case the jack itself looks fine (and static resistance\/diode mode measurements look fine too) and replacing the audio codec IC didn't make any difference. Will keep you updated if I get more info on this."

Almost fully working but the audio jack\u2026 Internal speakers work fine. Headphones won't get detected unless I put the machine to sleep and wake it up. But headphone output is distorted, more on the left channel btw. It \"pops\" when audio codec wakes up\/goes to sleep, pretty much when DC gets sent out. Sure enough, it looks like there's 2VDC on both channels. Replaced the audio codec IC, same thing. There's also 2VDC on HPREF, which I assume is what causes 2VDC on the output. I thought it may have been caused by U6400 so I removed it, same thing. I cut the trace just before TP[1]HPAMP_REF to isolate the audio codec IC, I now have 3V on the audio codec IC HPREF pin and 0V on the rest of the line. Now it's stuck in optical out. Previously L6400 was missing which caused U6400 to pull the SDA line low but that's been taken care of."
