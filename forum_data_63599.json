        "message":"Cant find any liquid on the board.\nAt the start there was short on PPBUS and UB300 was getting hot. \nReplaced and short is gone but on that side got 5V and 0.25A. Just in case replaced CD3215 one more time but same issue.\nOn another side 20V and around 1A.\n\nThere is Apple logo, no progress bar but after 15 seconds fans spins at max and its restarts (it stays at 20V but current drop to 0.08A)\n\nOn that side with 5V both CD3215 got correct LDOs in diode mode.\nTest 5V with USBC tester and all readings are correct.\n\nAny idea?"
