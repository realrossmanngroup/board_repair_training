After testing and comparing diode readings to another board it looks like U3200 wasn't getting PP3V3_G3H but the rest of the board was so after one more jumper wire we have 20v and it boots!!!!!. But its a 2016 so its got flexgate.... time to call the customer and tell them something I'm sure they already know but failed to mention...."
