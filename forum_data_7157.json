        "message":"I have a macbook air 820-3209 that turns on and runs, but runs terrible. I've tried several hard drives even external hdds. I when i try to boot into ASD 3s150 o.s. it gives me a circle with a line, but it will boot into the efi version of asd. I noticed the gpu gets really hot, fans on full speed. I did some probing around to find that i have a short to ground on pp1v05_s0_vccio and also on ppvcsa_s0_cpu. i ran down the ppvcsa_s0_cpu line to find i have a short in the pp1v05_so_vccio rail.\n\nIm thinking this could be a problem within the pch but not sure. Any help would be great.\n\nthanks."
