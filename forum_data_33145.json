        "message":"Hi Team,\n\nI have a 820-3462 with trace of liquid damage. cleaned with the Ultrasonic cleaner\nI already fixed the backlight.\nI had fans running at full speed: issue coming from the camera, now i've disconnected it and fans runing normally (all temp sensor reports normal temperatures)\n\nNow i'm facing to 2 weird behaviors:\nRegarding the keyboard: only few keys are working, the Trackpad works correctly.\nTaken Actions:\nReplaced the keyboard, and it's the same, with the same keys working. the Alt key is ok ( i can select the booting hdd)\n\n\nRegarding the wifi:\nwhen in the OS, it scans (wifi logo in action) but can't detect any network, when i click on network preferences, there it reports that the wifi state is disabled, when i click on enable it stays disabled.\nAlso if i go in the assistant wisard, there it can detect the surounding networks but can't register to any of them.\nHardware detected, Mac Adress OK\nIt can resgister to a network previously connected to.( same OS session with another macbook pro).\nBeside that the thunderbolt brigde is connected.....how is this possible?\nCould it be a kind of blacklisted motherboard? don't think so as I also replaced Airport card\n\nTaken action:\nReplaced Airport card with original RIO board: NOK\nReplaced RIO board with original Airport card: NOK\nReplaced Both together: NOK\n\nI've mesured the differents voltages related to the Airport (AP) and WLAN, they seems all OK\n\nExternal USB devices (flash drive, keyboard) : OK, I'll have to test the HDMI port.\n\nQuestion:\nCould both issues have a link? if yes i would redirect myself to U2700 (USB HUB Internal Devices ) and its surrounding area.\nCould both issues + the camera have a link? that would redirect me plus to the U1800......\n\nMaybe a communication signal is missing.  Could it be related to the OS? as i'm testing it from installed Sierra  USB 2.0 Flash drive (unfortunately i don't have an ssd for this board)\nIf you want me to take a specific mesurement feel free to ask.\nI will also try from an OS installed on USB 3.0 hdd, and also will try the bluetooth asap and update."
