        "message":"Working on an 820-2610 that had no power; replaced the problem cap as per usual and got life. Unit seems to be working well, but fails ASD test #72 for internal video, specifically the \"Fill Rect 2D Acceleration...\" test.\n\nIs this an issue related to the MCP\/GPU or the MUX? Is there anything I can do to see if there really is an issue (furmark, etc), or should I run EFI to see if it fails there as well? \n\nAll help appreciated--thanks!"
