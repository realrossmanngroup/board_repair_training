        "message":"Hello everyone i got a macbook air a1370 820-3024 that came in with a dim green light and no power. During visual inspection i found that it was missing TPS51980. I replaced this chip and i still not getting the fan to spin. Could the isl be causing this issue? I checked my voltages and I'm getting the following\n\nPPBUS_G3H 0.10v\nPPDCIN_G3H 16.98v\nPP3V42_G3H 0.25\n\nThanks,"
