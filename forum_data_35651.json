Replaced corroded J9500 to get SYS_ONEWIRE and light back. \nFan spins up to high immediately only on power supply or magsafe but doesn't actually turn on. CPU VCORE is present and CPU gets warm. \nNo boot in min config either. \n\nSlight corrosion on GND points between R5193 & C5602. Cleaned area, including under SMC (no reball).\n\nShould I be looking at bad CPU\/SMC or junk under? Something else obvious that I'm missing..?"
