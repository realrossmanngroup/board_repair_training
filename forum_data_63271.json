        "message":"Got this in today with a Keyboard issue.  I was told the keyboard is dead and needs replacing but Ive never worked on one of these before and looking online  replacement keyboards are hard to find and im reading that they are binded somehow to the T2 chip?\n\nThe odd thing is I tried to do an SMC \/ Pram reset, first time I did this the keyboard worked fine on the login screen and let me log into OS, once in the OS the keyboard was completely non responsive.\n\nI tried a few more times then gave up last night,  I turned it on this morning and the keyboard worked just fine logging in and for a couple of mins in the OS i was able to search google then the mac mad a system boing noise (same sound it makes when plugging in a charge cable) and the keyboard has stopped working again. I reboot and now its non responsive on the log in screen again,.\n\nLooking inside the mac its immaculate, no sign of any liquid or corrosion the board looks like new!\n\nSo I know the keyboard works it just seems something weird is going on,. Any help with this appreciated."
