Basically there was a little corrosion around it and no PP3V42_G3H at pin 12.\n\nI have a 5.043v feed @ PP5V1_CHGR_VDD and PP5V1_CHGR_VDDP on Pins 19 & 20 respectivly on U7000. I also have 16.6v at Pin 2 on U7000\n\nNow, I am also a little confused, the 80w charger states on it 18.5v @ 4.6A and 16.5v @ 3.6A yet at the DC in board and at the fuse F6905 it is reading 16.6v yet the line states PP18V5_DCIN_FUSE which should be 18.5v. I have used this adapter on many MBP circa 2012 and it is an original.\n\nI know something should be producing a 3.42v feed but I am completely brain dead as to what it is. I assume its U7000 but the likelyhood of having 2 duff.... maybe..."

I have gone around the other pins in diode mode with the black on pin 8 and touched the others with OL all around except pin 6 which as I expect no resistance and continual beep. \n\nTested R6905 and it shows no short to ground ( dont know why I did that, i think i like to hear a beep :) ). Resistance is 1.707 kohms . I do not have a 1 ohm resisitor to hand ( 1r0) but I have got a 1ohm ( 10Y) which going by my mate google should be OK, just slightly smaller. It reads 1.1 ohm, will this be OK?"
