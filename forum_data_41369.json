        "message":"hi, don't know the history of board as it was bought to use as donor board, but i noticed that 3v3_sus switch was missing, so i replaced it and it started working, but now it doesn't detect ssd.\ni have checked voltages to j3700 and  SMC_OOB1_R2D_CONN_L is missing. the problem is it comes from u3710, which is AND gate and signal that should be present on its input comes from smc and its missing.\nat this point i am out of ideas, can someone provide any solution?"
