        "message":"Hi everyone,\n\nI stuck in a MacBook Pro repair (820-4924-A).\nThe MacBook is powering on (fanspin, CPU gets warm) but i get no display.\nSo i started checking the LCD power rails and noticed that PP5VR3V3_SW_LCD is missing (0V) (LCD connector pins 28,29,30).\nHere I stuck because of missing experience.\nCan anybody give me some hints how to detect why this rail is missing?\n\nThank you!\nBest regards\ndudipupan"
