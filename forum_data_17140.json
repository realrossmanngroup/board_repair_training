Did you really try BIOS? Again this board will probably be a rabbit hole...[\/QUOTE]\n\nHad to test ROM in the TL866 as no donor chips with correct BIOS here. Reads good 3 times with same checksum so I guess it's OK since it reads. Checked the reads in UEFI tool too.\n\nEverything I get from this guy recently is either a clean shiny rabbit hole or a corroded crusty asshole resulting in wasted time. I can't see that it's been dropped but who fucking knows man.... It's going back dead.\nMy time is worth more than figuring out this problem.\n\nAppreciate the help Duke, thank you."
