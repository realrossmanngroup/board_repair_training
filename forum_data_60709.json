        "message":"Hi, first time poster, thank you for everything you guys do here.\n\nI have [B]820-01041[\/B] that had water spilled through the keyboard. The visible damage\/corrosion on the Logic Board was minimal.\n\nThe only visible damage was located around the CPU\/GPU Phase chips (U7220, U7230, QA340).. again very minimal, small amounts of white corrosion\/oxidation.\n\nAll ports show [B]20v[\/B] with [B]0A[\/B] draw.\n\nThe only thermal activity on the board is the T2 and corresponding charging chips warming up.\n                       \nPPBUS_G3H - 12.6v                           \nPPBUS_HS_CPU - 12.6v\nPPBUS_HS_GPU - 12.6v\n\nPPVCC_S0_CPU - 0v\nPPVCCSA_S0_CPU - 0v\nPPVCCGT_S0_CPU - 0v\nPPVCCIO_S0_CPU - 0v\n[I]*Resistance measurements match good board on all CPU lines listed above*[\/I]\n\nPP1V2_S3 - 0v\nPP1V2_S3_CPUDDR - 0v\nPP1V2_S0SW - 0v\n\nPP1V8_G3S - 1.8v\nPP5V_G3S - 5.1v\nPP3V3_G3H_T- 3.3v\n\n\n\n\nPlease note the following:\n1. I have tested all the lines that show up as 0v for shorts to ground and all line readings match good board.\n2. I attempted T2 revive after cleaning visible corrosion and I get error [B]code 4010[\/B], the fans go [B]full[\/B] speed after failed T2 revive.\n3. I replaced [B]U7210[\/B], [B]U7220[\/B], [B]U7230[\/B] and attempted T2 revive again and it still failed with 4010 and I still get 0V on all CPU rails\n4. I understand board may fall into the \"[I]brain dead[\/I]\" category, however I want to cover all my bases and learn potential additional troubleshooting methods I could apply in this situation. It feels like the board should be repairable as the liquid damage was visibly very minimal.\n\nThank you for your time."
