        "message":"I cannot figure out this one and I've got a feeling that this is just some stupid mistake I'm doing over and over again :D \n\nNo liquid damage, oxidation, signs of previous repairs or any other damage anywhere in this laptop, system board looks almost like a new one. Customer says it just did not turn on one day. \n\nMagSafe light works - green then orange, but it does not turn on as the PM_SLP_S4_L is always low (0.01V). But if I disconnect the \"data ribbon\" (J9500), then it suddenly starts working and turns on. I tried 2 other known working power boards and ribbon cables, no luck with that (I also tried the original power board+ribbon in a different machine and it also works). I inspected the whole board, especially the SMC and J9500 area from all angles, everything looks OK there. I also did not find any shorts on J9500.\n\nThank you"
