        "message":"Hey there. 2017 A1707 with dead display and battery. USB charger first showed pulsing 5V - 16V in loop. After disconnecting the battery macbook booted, display is obviously dead (flexgate) but external worked.\n\nWhen reconnecting the battery, USB charger begins to loop again. Found a burnt USB-C port and CB501 was off from one pad. Resoldered but no change for loop.\nPPVBAT_G3H_CONN is 12,66V\n\nIs this just a dead battery?"
