This 2017 macbook was labeled \"shut off during osx black screen upgrade and now it will not boot. Not sure if the upgrade was the OS  or bios.\n\nWithout the battery it is taking 20v and 1.33-1.37a. No startup chime or light on the caps lock. Fans Spin. Nothing on the screen. \n\nWhere do I start?"
