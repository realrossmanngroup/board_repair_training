        "message":"Hi Guys, I have a Mac Air 11\" 3208 with no green\/red light. Checked power and no G3H and 3.42 as well. On Q6910 I get 20.55v on C6912 pin 1. I have checked the resistors as well and get some different readings then what my schematics say. Now I have seen many istances where the schematics have wrong data, could you have a look at the readings I got and let me know if this is OK, R6911 and 6912 seem a bit off. Thanks!\n\nEdit: I just figured R6905 has a hole in it, so will try replacing that first :)"
