        "message":"I have a macbook which dont go on.\navailable rails are pp3v42, ppbusbus, s5 and s0 but no pp5v_s0. i already replaced q7940 but no result. enable signal is also available diode reading on pp5v_s0 is 0.409. power supply hangs on 0.089 amps. I am new to macbook logicboard repair and any help is much appriciated. it is my learning board so i can experiment on it."

R7879 is 22k resistor on the boards."
