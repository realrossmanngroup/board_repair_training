        "message":"I have a 820-3332 that once it goes into sleep, with the MagSafe charge not plugged in, it will refuse to come back on until i perform SMC reset. During the period that it won't power on, i plugged in the MagSafe and the light on the MagSafe would some times never lights up until the SMC reset. Other times it lights up orange, never goes through the initial green then orange until i do the smc reset. Can't seem to create the same fail with MagSafe connected when the computer is put into sleep mode. I've replaced the battery with the same result. \n\nCould this be SMC related?\n\nAny suggestions"
