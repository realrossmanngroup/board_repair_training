        "message":"820-2530\n\nSome slight liquid damage signs around rear edge. \n\nThought ok probably damaged 3v42 line. Check it getting 3.38V seems low. No obvious damage around the boost IC. \n\nChecked ACOK line from u7000 0v\nCheck ACIN 0v\nReplaced u7000 due to internal short pulling ACIN low. \n\nNow have 4v on ACIN and ACOK reads 3.3v\n\nStill dim green light. Also inrush MOSFET first gate isn't opening, so no pp_g3h being made either. \n\nIs this still a u7000 issue or is the 3v42 too low causing a weird issue. \n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nDCIN is 16.6 -16.8v and fluctuates quite a bit not a steady voltage"
