        "message":"This board will usually boot fine the first time but will often not turn back on with or without battery plugged in. On bench nothing plugged in if I shutoff by grounding SMC_ONOFF_L it wont restart. IN this state, I get 3.4V at SMC_ONOFF_L with and without keyboard plugged in. When triggering on\/off I get voltage drop at PM_PWRBTN_L. When it won't restart I tested voltages at U5110 and everything looks good there.  Board always starts when I unplug and replug charger back in. Somerhing appears ro not be resetting when board stays connected to power but shut down manually or via OS. Only if removing all power.\n\nPM_SLP_S4_L is not present. From what I can tell the below are all present:\n\nPPVRTC_G3H\nRTC_RESET_L\nPCH_SRTCRST_L\nPCH_INTVRMEN_L\nPCH_DSWVRMEN_L\nPP3V3_S5\nPM_DSW_PWRGD\nPP3V3_SUS\nPM_BATLOW_L\nPM_RSMRST_L\nPM_PWRBTN_L"

So if I shut the board off it seems to go to normal s5 state (rails are not pulsing), but once I trigger the board to start again, the board is continously trying to restart and I get pulse at PLT_RESET_L.\n\nI couldn't get the board to PRAM reset when it was in the Mac so I PRAM reset via Medusa and also did cleanME. The board still won't start again without disconnecting power."
