        "message":"Good day guys\n\nam currently busy on a board, and I am struggling to get the PM_BATLOW_L signal, I have replaced the known good SMC but no changes, the same SMC works okay on a different board and I get PM_BATLOW_L, but on this board, I don't have it, other SMC output signals are present and my ppbus voltage is properly regulated by the SMC too. I checked for a short to ground and there's non, is there somewhere I need to check for this signal? without the signal being created, am unable to move forward, please help."
